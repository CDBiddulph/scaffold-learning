**Analyzing crossword clues**

I'm checking the grid, starting with the first clue from the top-left white square, which looks like it has a letter count of four. I think 1-Across might be "COPE." For 5-Across, the clue about a device connected to a router could be "modem," but I’m also considering "cable" or even "ethernet." For 10-Across, "song syllables" might refer to "la la la" or variations. As for 14-Across, I'm leaning toward "OPAL," given the clue about a gemstone. Finally, 15-Across seems to point towards "Obama."

**Solving the crossword clues**

For 15-Across, I have "OBAMA." Moving to 16-Across, "Spoken" could be "oral." For 17-Across, I'm unsure but maybe it relates to "tattle." 20-Across should be "ant" since it fits the clue about insects in a colony. I'm guessing "ALASKA" for 22-Across, where Fairbanks is. For 23-Across, "American ___" might be "American Pie." I think "COOPS" fits for 25-Across referring to pigeon shelters. "Glue" seems likely for 26-Across, tan adhesive. The end-of-class sound seems to be "ding," and "solo" is straightforward for 31-Across. I'll tentatively say "est." for 32-Across, and moving to 36-Across, "rat" makes sense as a cousin of a mouse. For 37-Across, "atoms" fits for parts of molecules. "In debt" might fit for 39-Across. "Aloof" fits for 40-Across, and for 43-Across, maybe "Inuit" or "Cree." "Amen" seems right for 44-Across. The bank offering likely refers to "CDs," and "madhouse" seems appropriate for the chaotic spectacle. For 50-Across, "door" makes sense, and I think "hobbit" is a possibility for the missing link in our ancestry.
