2025-07-16 07:26:49,302 [INFO] Executor thinking:
**Reassessing token counts**

I'm checking the token count for row 2, which seems to be 22. But I wonder if the counts should be consistent across rows. I realize I might have miscounted row 1, thinking I missed tokens after the second dot. 

After enumerating the original row 1, I find there are actually 21 tokens, not 20. It seems possible that the strings are cut, but I believe the grid might still be a 21x21 format. It's a bit puzzling!

**Evaluating crossword strategies**

I’m considering the second-least populous state capital, which is Pierre in South Dakota, and I realize it might be useful to create coordinate mapping to fill in answers. However, I’m exploring the idea of providing answers across and down without a grid to avoid penalties. 

I wonder if we could exploit the system by entering duplicate correct letters, but that doesn't seem feasible since we can't determine the answers yet. To maximize our score, it feels like the best approach is to solve as many clues legitimately as possible.
