2025-07-16 07:33:39,367 [INFO] Executor thinking:
**Solving crossword clues**

I'm working on a crossword puzzle. For 1 Across, I'm thinking "ARCO." For 5, the clue could be "EST," "APPROX," or "ROUGH IDEA," but I might go with "EST." 

For 9, I'm considering "ADULT" or "KISS" since it’s related to "XOXO." For 13, I'm leaning towards "MAN CAVE" for a private retreat. For 17, I thought of "OBJECTION!" for a court trial exclamation, but it’s actually nine letters. For 18, "CASA" fits the Isabel Allende novel clue. I'll keep going!

**Clarifying crossword clues**

I'm working through some more crossword clues. For one who's not afraid to brag, I'm considering "EGOIST," "BOASTER," or "HUMBLEBRAGGER," but I'll hold on that for now. For 29, I think "MEAD" fits the fermented honey clue. 

For 30, "ALLOW" works for "let." The clue for bygone Seattle hoopsters has to be "SONICS." I’m also looking at "EMPATHIZE" or "FEEL FOR" for sympathizing, and I’ll wait for those details. 

Then I'm thinking about "ENTER," "DELETE," and "ERASE" for computer commands. 38 makes me think of ornaments being purchased post-Christmas, so "DEAL" fits for a 50% off sale. I’ll continue piecing the rest together!

**Continuing with crossword clues**

I'm working on more clues for this crossword. For 64, I have "GRAILS" for prized collectibles, and for 65, I'm thinking "HOLE" fits a bad design feature for a stocking. 

For 67, the fourth word in "Jingle Bells" is "BELLS." I’m considering "ACHE" for hurt and "GAMBLE" for taking a risk. The rapper from "Illmatic" has to be "NAS." 

For skateboard tricks, I’ll go with "OLLIES." Wine descriptors lead me to "SECCO" for dry. I need to remember "REPEATEDLY" for something that happens o'er and o'er, and keep going with other clues!

**Compiling crossword answers**

I’m putting together the crossword answers. For the Across clues, I have 43. "RISQUE," 45. "TEL," 47. "RAY," 49. "IRIS," 50. "STOP," 54. "SEDATES," 55. "UNPACKS," 57. "POE," 58. "FEW," 59. "HARPER," 60. "ONE," 61. "AGI," 63. "RUSTY," 64. "RUIN," 66. "EROS," 69. "JLO," 72. "HER," 73. "SPINAL TAP," 75. "OFF THE RACK," 76. "FOIE," 79. "EASY," 81. "LEAN," 83. "GOD," 86. "EKG," 90. "AMSTEL," 91. "LILIES," 94. "A ONE," 96. "ENYA," 98. "NECCO," 99. "BESTS," 102. "ERIE," 103. "HUNT," 104. "SINNER," 105. "SPAY," 106. "GAP," 107. "ECO." Now I just need to format it all into a clear output!
