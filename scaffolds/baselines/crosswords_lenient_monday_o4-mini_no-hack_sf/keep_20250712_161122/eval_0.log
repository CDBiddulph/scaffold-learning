2025-07-12 23:15:15,121 [INFO] Executor thinking:
**Planning crossword fill**

I need to fill a 15x15 crossword grid where black squares are represented by dots (".") and blanks by dashes ("-"). My goal is to achieve a full or almost complete fill with words that fit both across and down. To clarify the grid, I'll rewrite the pattern with coordinates for better organization. For example, Rows 1 and 2 have the same pattern: four blanks, a black square, and several more blanks. I’ll continue this for all rows to get a clear layout.

**Mapping out the crossword**

I’m continuing my layout for the crossword grid, focusing on specific rows. For Row 3, I see a dot at column 9, while Row 4 starts and ends with dots and has spaces in between. Each subsequent row has its own unique pattern, leading me to analyze them carefully.

Now, I’ll start filling in the across slots. The first clue for Row 1 suggests "Christmas baubles," which could be "ornaments," but that's too long. I'm considering alternatives like "TINS," but it doesn’t seem right. Baubles made of glass? Hmm, it’s tricky!

**Analyzing crossword clues**

I’m working on Row 15 and examining the letters across each column, especially focusing on how they interact with the down clues. For example, Down 1 starts at Row 1, Column 1, and spans several rows until reaching a dot. I initially thought the letters could fit clues like "OKs," but that doesn't make sense with the pattern I have.

I’m considering alternatives like "snack mix" for a "hodgepodge bowlful of munchies," which actually fits my letters better. Adjusting my previous guess from "trail mix" to "snack mix" seems promising, updating my letters accordingly. Let’s keep moving!
