**Analyzing crossword clues**

I’m looking at the first row of a crossword. The first clue for 1-Across is "Bit of punctuation," and the answer could be "COMMA," which fits nicely. For 6-Across, the clue is "Sketch," and it seems "DRAW" is the right fit. Then, for 10-Across, which is related to ROTFL, I’m considering "LOL" since it’s recognized slang. That said, I'm unsure if "OF" might fit better, but that doesn't seem to connect well.

**Deciphering crossword clues**

I realized that "THE" fits in part of ROTFL, giving me 10-Across as "THE." Moving to Row 2, I see the clue for 13-Across is "Culinary tearjerker," which hints at "ONION" — makes sense since it makes people cry! For 14-Across, "Carefree quality," I suspect "EASE" fits neatly. Then, for 15-Across, short for "prehistoric predator," "T REX" seems ideal. For 16-Across, I'm struggling with clues about an ephemeral trend, so I’ll think more on that.

**Compiling crossword answers**

I’m gathering across answers for several clues and it looks like we have a good number filled in: 28 out of 63. I’ll list them by number for clarity. The answers include "COMMA," "DRAW," "THE," "ONION," "EASE," and several others, totaling 28. I want to format them correctly with double spaces between the number and the answer. Thanks to the organization, it’ll make things easier for the scorer to check if they match the expected clues!
