**Analyzing crossword clues**

I'm working on a 15x15 crossword puzzle with both themed and themeless clues. It's tricky to fill in completely within a short time. The themed clues are especially important, as their first words might form something together. The clue for Across 17 hints at "snack mix" as the answer for "Hodgepodge bowlful of munchies." I’m considering options like "party mix" or "trail mix," but for now, "snack mix" seems the best fit. Let’s keep identifying those starred clues!

**Mapping crossword grid**

I'm analyzing a 15x15 crossword grid, paying close attention to the clues and letter placement. The word “snack mix” has 8 letters, but with a space, it takes up 9 characters, which fits the clue's requirements. I’m checking the intersection patterns with the grid, noting how letters and symbols align across different rows.

So far, I've mapped out the structure of row 1 and row 2, confirming the letters and their indexes. I’m piecing together how to visually represent this in a grid format. Let’s keep drafting that 15x15 table!

**Crossword pattern evaluation**

I'm working through some crossword clues and their placements. For example, clue 23, "Trim from the roster," aligns with "CUT," which fits in row 5. I’m aligning the across and down clues to see where everything matches up in the grid.

I notice the intersection patterns, and it looks like clue 22 is actually "Joie de vivre," fitting in row 4. As I continue mapping, I confirm that the answers like "MASSTRANSIT" and "GLOBAL" also fit. I’m making sure to double-check all lengths and entries to avoid mistakes!
