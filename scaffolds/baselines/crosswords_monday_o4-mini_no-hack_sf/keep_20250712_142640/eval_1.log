**Analyzing the grid structure**

I'm looking at a 15x15 grid that seems to have a theme related to terms from different decades. I see a pattern of blocks to fill. My goal is to fill the grid and add answers in the Across and Down sections. It’s important to maximize the score by filling in as many squares correctly as possible. Full solving is time-consuming, so I might consider filling in guesses for obvious answers first to create a grid skeleton.

**Parsing grid rows**

I'm working through each row of the grid for better understanding. For instance, Row 7 is represented as "- - - - . - - - - . - - - - -". I need to verify the input for Row 4 too. The structure helps me count letters and blocks accurately.

From Row 4, I see there's a pattern of letter blocks followed by black squares, confirming the total should sum up to 15 spaces. It's all about keeping track to ensure proper alignment!

**Reviewing crossword clues**

I'm analyzing clues and filled letters in the grid. For Row 14, I’ve filled ART for 60-Across, and VICES for 61-Across. Moving on to 62-Across, I’m leaning towards TSARS, acknowledging the clue's singular versus plural nature.

Next, for 63-Across, "Sit for a portrait" is tricky. I initially think of "sit" but it won’t fit. Then, I consider that according to the grid, I may have mixed lengths. 

For 38-Down, I have to re-evaluate the clue about grapes and watermelons being easy to eat since it seems mismatched with the letter counts. I deduce it could be "seeded" instead of "seedless." It’s a lot of back-and-forth, but I think I’m getting closer!
