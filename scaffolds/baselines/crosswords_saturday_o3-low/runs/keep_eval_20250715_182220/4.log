**Recreating the grid coordinates**

I'm working with a grid where '-' signifies fillable squares and '.' represents black squares. My goal is to fill in letters based on across/down answers, though the grid isn't strictly necessary for now. I need to solve some clues. For Row 1, I've got a pattern: six dashes, a dot, followed by eight dashes. That totals 15 cells, so I'm marking the indices from 1 to 15. I think I'm on the right track!

**Analyzing clues and grid positions**

For Row 1, the first column forms Across 1 with a length of 6. The clue hints at "drawings," which I'm thinking may relate to "BANKS," but that doesn't fit. Maybe "LOTS," referring to lotteries. I’m unsure, so I’ll keep it open. Row 1, column 8, corresponds to Across 7 with the clue "Half of a Godfather cocktail, along with whisky." That matches "AMARETTO," so that's good! Moving to Row 2, the patterns repeat with clue 15 leading to "IPHONE." Row 2, column 8, clues me to "LAMAZE CLASS." Now onto Row 3, where clue 17 is tricky; I’m contemplating "UPDO" for it. Row 3, column 8, brings up "ONCE MORE," which fits nicely. Row 4 has a similar pattern; I'm focusing on how far to the dot in column 4.

**Summarizing Row Patterns and Clues**

In Row 4, I see a pattern of three letters followed by a dot. This gives me Across 19 with the clue "Something you might kick," leading to the answer "CAN." Moving on, for Across 20, the clue "Sit ___ (mourn)" points to "SHIVA." For Across 22, "Comedian Wanda," translates to "SYKES." 

In Row 5, the first character is a dot, meaning Across 23 starts from column 2, and the clue is "Fam member." I’ll hold on that. For Across 25, "Must give," I’m considering "OWES." Then for Across 27, "Who might mistakenly respond" could be "SIRI." 

In Row 6, not having a dot until column 12 gives me Across 28 with the clue "'I'll be right with you,'" potentially "JUSTASECOND." Finally, Across 31 is "TOE." In Row 7, I’m looking at another clue "Ascribe, as blame," and I’ll explore that more!

**Reviewing Puzzle Progress**

In Row 11, there's some tweaking to do since col13 has an "E" after "HEE." I also note that col14's "E" is unchanged. Moving on, I've marked Down30 as solved (TIBET) but need to clarify Down32 and others. 

While reviewing Down43, I realize the letters "I A M P L E" can actually spell "SAMPLE" instead of "IAMPLE." Thus, I’ll adjust Row10’s first letter to "S." 

As for Down40, it might hint at "SIN." Finally, I've confirmed that the remaining sections are filled out as expected for the puzzle completion!

**Finalizing Puzzle Output**

I've checked Row14 and found that all letters align well, confirming the grid's completion. Each down clue has been accounted for, though one clue (Down50) might be missing due to numbering issues. Now, it's time to present the final output in the correct format with spaces between letters.

Here’s how the grid appears:

Row1: L O T T O S . A M A R E T T O  
Row2: I P H O N E . B A B Y M O O N  
Row3: S O I R E E . O N C E M O R E  
Row4: A S S . S H I V A . S Y K E S  
Row5: . S I S . O W E T O . S I R I  
Row6: J U S T A M O M E N T . T O E  
Row7: I M P U T E . Y E S I D O . .  
Row8: A S O N E . E P S . B E N T S  
Row9: . . I G U A N A . S E N T R A  
Row10: S I N . P L A Y C A T C H U P  
Row11: A T T N . I M G A Y . H E E  
Row12: M A L I A . O R B I T . C L E  
Row13: P L E T H O R A . N O S H O W  
Row14: L I S T E N E D . G O L I V E  
Row15: E A S Y M O D E . S T O N E R
