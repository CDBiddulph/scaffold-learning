**Analyzing crossword strategy**

I’m looking at a cryptic crossword puzzle where the aim is to fill in grid squares while maximizing the score. The goal is to get as many correct answers as possible based on clues. I need to track correct and incorrect squares, ensuring my output matches the expected solution perfectly. However, since I don't have the exact solution, the challenge lies in producing a fully solved puzzle. It’s a significant task given the theme, but there might be ways around it. Outputting nothing would give a zero score, but filling all dots isn’t the answer either.

**Examining crossword fill strategy**

In a crossword puzzle, each fillable square ties to an answer, either across or down. Including across answers for all clues ensures every relevant square gets marked, but one-letter across answers present a challenge since they’re treated differently. Typically, there aren’t many entries of length 1, and across answers usually start from a black square. 

To optimize scores, I could produce a section of across clues with the expected answers, but that’s tricky when I don’t know them. I could create a repetitive pattern or leverage known phrases, but those could yield wrong answers. Ultimately, my strategy might be to output the expected grid letters while intentionally leaving some blanks to maintain integrity.

**Solving crossword clues**

I’m diving into crosswords now. For Row 7, the clue "End-of-class sound" could suggest 'bell' since it rings at class’s end, but 'ding' feels more accurate as the sound. For "By oneself," I’m confident 'solo' fits perfectly. Now for the abbreviation related to a year on a business sign, 'estab.' aligns well; I'm going with 'ESTAB.'

In Row 8, "Cousin of a mouse" fits 'vole.' I'm checking the grid closely for clarity. The segments I've analyzed add up to 15 columns, so I've confirmed I’m tracking correctly. Let's keep solving!
