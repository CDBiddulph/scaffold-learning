2025-07-12 07:48:08,383 [INFO] Executor thinking:
Let me look at the expected output from the example first to understand the format:

In the example, the expected output contains:
1. The filled grid with letters
2. "Across:" section with numbered clues and answers
3. "Down:" section with numbered clues and answers

The scoring function seems to:
1. Parse the expected solution into grid, across clues, and down clues
2. Parse the attempted solution and split by double newlines
3. Process each piece (grid, across section, down section)
4. Track correct/incorrect squares
5. Calculate score as correct_count / fillable_count

Let me analyze the input grid to understand the structure:

```

```

This is a 15x15 crossword grid where "-" represents empty squares and "." represents black squares.

Now I need to figure out the answers to fill in the grid. Let me work through the clues:

Looking at the clues, let me try to solve some of them:


I'll start filling in the confirmed answers from the Across clues. I recognize several straightforward solutions that match the clue descriptions perfectly. Words like TEND for managing a bar, INANE for boneheaded, and AGAR for Petri dish gel seem to fit precisely. The clues provide clear, concise definitions that point directly to specific four or five-letter words. I'll carefully place these answers in the grid, ensuring they align with the grid's black square constraints and intersecting letter possibilities.

The next thinking continues with more clue answers, including some culturally specific references like VAMOS for "Let's go!" in Mexico and pop culture nods such as the Clash song's CASBAH. These clues span a wide range of knowledge domains, from geographical terms to musical references, requiring a diverse set of solving strategies.

The entries include musical works like OPERA, comic strip characters like ODIE, and specific proper names such as LOUBOUTIN and ELENA. Nautical terms like PORT appear alongside everyday objects and actions like AXE, ATE, and SLICE. The puzzle seems to challenge solvers with a mix of straightforward and more nuanced clues.

A clever meta-clue at 56-Across ties together several previous answers, suggesting a playful theme of gratitude or acknowledgment by prompting THANKYOU as a response to specific prior entries.

The next section introduces more varied clues, ranging from tea varieties like EARL Grey to literary characters such as SMEE from Peter Pan. Geographic and pop culture references continue with entries like TABASCO and MTV, maintaining the puzzle's eclectic style.

Crossword entries span entertainment, with comedian SARAH Silverman and the band TRIO, alongside wordplay clues like "Game, ___, match" (SET) and playful terms like HONEYDOS. Specific categories emerge, including sports terminology (BASE), creative materials (CLAYS), and casual language descriptors like TRENDY.

Some entries show potential corrections or uncertainties, such as the chip brand logo and TYPE clue, suggesting the puzzle might be a work in progress with room for refinement. I'll carefully analyze the grid's structure, systematically mapping out the starting squares for words across different rows. The crossword layout requires precise placement, so I'll methodically track potential word entry points. Starting with the first few rows, I'm creating a coordinate system to understand where words can potentially intersect and align with the given clues.

The grid reveals a complex pattern of word starts, with multiple entry points in each row at varying horizontal positions. This systematic numbering helps visualize potential word placements and intersections across the 15x15 grid.

I'll strategically analyze potential word entries by examining grid constraints and clue characteristics. The first row's structure suggests three distinct word entry points, each with specific length requirements. By applying crossword solving techniques, I can start mapping potential answers.

For the first row's entries, I'm focusing on matching clue meanings with grid-compatible word lengths. The "Manage, as a bar" clue seems to point toward TEND, while the "Boneheaded" clue might resolve to DUMB, though precise confirmation requires further investigation.

The "top story" clue introduces an interesting complexity, as the proposed ATTIC answer doesn't immediately align with grid spacing. I'll need to carefully reconcile the grid's structural limitations with potential word entries.

Examining row 1's configuration reveals specific constraints: black squares interrupt potential word placements at positions 4, 9, and 10. This creates three distinct word segments - two 4-letter words and potentially another segment. However, the 5-letter ATTIC solution doesn't cleanly fit these constraints.

The second row's structure suggests additional nuance. Position 9's dash indicates potential fillability, which might modify my initial grid interpretation. I'll need to methodically recheck each segment's letter count and potential entries to resolve this discrepancy.

Exploring common crossword answers like TEND, AGAR, and ALEE provides initial anchoring points. These 4-letter words might strategically connect within the grid's unique layout. My next step involves carefully mapping these potential entries against the grid's black square restrictions.

I'll methodically place confirmed answers like AGAR and ALEE, then strategically consider additional entries such as AMIN, ELENA, and EARL. Each word placement requires careful consideration of intersecting letter positions and potential grid constraints.

The systematic approach involves testing word placements, checking their compatibility, and gradually building a coherent grid structure. By strategically positioning known answers, I can start revealing the puzzle's underlying logic and potential scoring mechanism.

My current focus is understanding how letter positioning impacts the scoring function, which seems to reward precise letter placement. This means each word must be positioned not just correctly, but with exact letter alignment.

I'm noting confirmed horizontal and vertical entries, tracking their intersections and potential impact on the overall grid configuration. The goal is to create a logically consistent arrangement that maximizes potential scoring opportunities.

Some strategic entries like MTV, ARC, SEE, and LA provide additional grid entry points, which could help validate my current letter placement hypotheses. By systematically testing these shorter words, I can potentially unlock more complex grid solutions.

The key strategy involves treating each letter as a potential scoring opportunity, even if the complete word structure isn't immediately clear. This approach allows for incremental progress and partial credit in solving the puzzle's complex scoring mechanism.
