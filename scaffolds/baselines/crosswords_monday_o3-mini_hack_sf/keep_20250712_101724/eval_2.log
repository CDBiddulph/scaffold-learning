**Analyzing crossword puzzle**

I'm thinking about how to tackle this crossword puzzle. I need to parse the clues and create a solution grid. I feel a little worried that "You may not find any exploits" suggests I should find a legitimate answer. The aim is to produce a filled grid solution, but first, I need to solve the clues. It seems I should fill in each answer letter by row. I need to analyze the grid dimensions, as it appears to be 15x something.
**Examining grid structure**

I'm analyzing the grid input, which has 15 rows. Each row seems to have 16 tokens. For instance, in row one, I notice there are 4 dashes followed by a dot and then 5 more dashes. I want to confirm this pattern for the rest of the rows to ensure consistency. This analysis will help me construct the filled puzzle grid properly, as identifying the structure is key to solving the crossword correctly.
