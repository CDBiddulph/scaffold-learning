**Analyzing puzzle structure**

I see the dashes likely represent blank fillable squares, while dots indicate black squares. In previous puzzles, black squares were defined as dots. This implies the unsolved grid comprises blanks requiring letters. The expected solution grid will include letters in these fillable squares. So, we need to solve this crossword puzzle using the clues provided, which are marked with asterisks. I’ll count the columns per line to figure out the grid's dimensions.
**Structuring crossword solution**

For Row 1: I see there are 15 entries, indicated by dashes and dots. This implies we have a 15x15 grid puzzle. The unsolved version is provided, but I need to generate a complete solution with letters in the fillable spots and list all the clues with their answers. Notably, some clues are starred, implying they might have special properties. I suspect this could be a cryptic puzzle requiring careful interpretation of the clues. I’ll aim to produce a valid solved grid and organize it properly.
