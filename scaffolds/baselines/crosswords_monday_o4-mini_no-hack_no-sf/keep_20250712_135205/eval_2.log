**Filling the crossword grid**

I’m working on a themed crossword puzzle that requires filling a 15x15 grid with answers listed both Across and Down. For Row 1, I see the pattern includes letters and black squares, which I’ll represent with periods. I’ll assign coordinates to help organize the clues, identifying specific slots for the answers. For the first clue, "Manage, as a bar," I suspect the answer is “tend bar.” I’ll continue filling in the grid and updating the clues!

**Filling in crossword answers**

I’m trying to fill in the answers for the crossword. For 1 Across, it seems "TEND" fits the clue about managing a bar, scoring 4 letters. Moving to 5 Across, "DUMB" also works for the clue "Boneheaded." Next, for 9 Across, "AGAR" aligns with the petri dish gel clue.

Row 2 starts with 13 Across, where "ALEE" seems correct for being sheltered from the wind. Then, I have "ATTIC" for 14 Across, and "ROPE" fits perfectly for 16 Across. Lastly, Row 3 has "BARMITZVAH" for 17 Across, which fills nicely!

**Checking row patterns**

I'm reviewing Row 4 in the crossword. The given pattern seems off since it totals 16 columns instead of 15, which is what the grid requires. I notice I counted the dashes, and the dashes and dots don’t align properly. 

After examining nearby rows, I realize Row 6 might have extra dashes as well, leading to inconsistencies in counting. 

I’ll need to ensure that all rows are accurate and aligned correctly to fit within the grid’s constraints!
