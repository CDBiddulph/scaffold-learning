**Solving the crossword clues**

I'm working through some crossword clues. For the 6-letter clue about becoming a new country, “secede” fits perfectly since it means to leave a federation. Then I spot the 7-letter clue for horses' homes, which is “stables.” Next, there's a 4-letter clue for “joie de vivre,” leading to “zest.” Lastly, I'm thinking about a 3-letter word for trimming from a roster, which is likely “cut.” Now, I'm looking at a 10-letter phrase for public transport.

**Revising crossword entries**

I'm analyzing the crossword clues. For the clue involving "I," I initially thought it could mean “info,” but I realized the pattern indicates some blocks too. Row 7 should have four letters, and then blocks, forming a sequence where col 7-11 spells “await.” So, the pattern needs to reflect 4 letters for “INFO,” followed by two blocks, and then 5 letters for “AWAIT.” This updated understanding helps me structure row 7 correctly.
