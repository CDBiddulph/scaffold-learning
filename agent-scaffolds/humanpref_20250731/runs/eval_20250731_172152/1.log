Original prompt: Explain this notation: f: D->E and f(x)=y

Response A:
The notation "f: D -> E" represents a function named "f" that maps elements from a set D (the domain) to a set E (the codomain). In this context, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain.

The expression "f(x) = y" describes the outcome of applying the function f to an element x within its domain, D. It states that when the function f is applied to x, the result is the element y in the codomain E.

To summarize:

- f is the name of the function.
- D is the domain, the set of all possible inputs for the function f.
- E is the codomain, the set of all possible outputs that f can produce.
- x represents an arbitrary element from the domain D.
- y is the corresponding element in the codomain E that f maps x to.

The entire statement is read as "f is a function from D to E such that for each element x in D, f(x) equals y in E." This defines the relationship between elements in the domain and their images in the codomain under the function f.

Response B:
This notation refers to functions in mathematics. Specifically:

- f: D->E 

This indicates that f is a function that maps elements from the domain D to elements in the codomain E. The arrow -> indicates that f is a function that takes inputs from the set D and outputs to the set E.

- f(x)=y

This gives more specifics about the function f. It says that f is a function that maps the input x in the domain D to the output y. So y is the image or output value that results when f acts on the input x.

For example:

f: R->R  (f is a function from the reals to the reals)  

f(x) = x^2     (f maps x to x squared)

So here f maps real numbers to real numbers, and specifically it takes an input x and outputs the number x squared. The input set R and output set R are the same since it maps reals to reals, but they could be different sets as well. The f(x)=y notation fully specifies what the function does to particular inputs.
