Original prompt: Write a screenplay to a Julia Child cooking show episode, which starts as usual but gradually takes on sinister elements, and by the end is a scene of full blown cosmic horror.

Response A:
The episode begins with Julia introducing a new recipe for a classic French dish, Coq au Vin. As she progresses through the cooking process, small anomalies begin to appear. The wine she is using seems to be behaving strangely, as if it has a mind of its own. As she completes the dish, it becomes clear that something sinister is going on. The dish tastes delicious, but it has an unexpected and horrifying side effect - it opens a portal to another dimension, full of malevolent entities that want to invade our world. Julia and her viewers must team up to fight off the creatures, or else face certain destruction.
