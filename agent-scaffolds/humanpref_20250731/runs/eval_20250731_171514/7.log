Original prompt: On average, 5% of people making flight reservations do not show up. Airline sells 52 tickets for a flight with 50 seats.  What is the probability that there will be seat available for every passenger that shows up?

Response A:
To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability distribution, where the number of trials (n) is the number of tickets sold (52), the probability of success on a single trial (p) is the probability of a passenger not showing up (0.05), and the number of successes (k) is the number of passengers not showing up that would result in every passenger who does show up having a seat (at least 2 no-shows since there are 52 tickets sold for 50 seats).

The probability that exactly k passengers do not show up is given by the binomial probability formula:

P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)

where "n choose k" is the binomial coefficient calculated as:

(n choose k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

We want to find the probability that at least 2 passengers do not show up, which means we need to calculate the probability for k = 2, k = 3, k = 4, ..., up to k = 52. To find the probability that there will be at least one seat available for every passenger that shows up, we can calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 2 to k = 52.

Let's calculate the probability for k = 2 first:

P(X = 2) = (52 choose 2) * 0.05^2 * (1 - 0.05)^(52 - 2)

First, we calculate the binomial coefficient for k = 2:

(52 choose 2) = 52! / (2! * (52 - 2)!)
               = 52! / (2! * 50!)
               = (52 * 51) / (2 * 1)
               = 1326

Now we substitute it into the formula:

P(X = 2) = 1326 * 0.05^2 * 0.95^50
         â‰ˆ 1326 * 0.0025 * 0.076944...
         
However, we need to add up the probabilities for k = 2 through k = 52, which can be quite tedious to do by hand. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of at least one event happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of none of the events happening.

The events we want to avoid are the cases where 0 or 1 passengers do not show up, as this would mean there are not enough seats for all showing-up passengers. Thus, we calculate:

P(at least 2 no-shows) = 1 - (P(0 no-shows) + P(1 no-show))

Let's calculate P(0 no-shows) and P(1 no-show):

P(X = 0) = (52 choose 0) * 0.05^0 * 0.95^52
         = 1 * 1 * 0.95^52

P(X = 1) = (52 choose 1) * 0.05^1 * 0.95^51
         = 52 * 0.05 * 0.95^51

Now we can find P(at least 2 no-shows):

P(at least 2 no-shows) = 1 - (P(0 no-shows) + P(1 no-show))

Calculating these probabilities typically requires a calculator or computer, as the powers of 0.95 can be cumbersome to compute by hand. For practical purposes, you can use a scientific calculator, statistical software, or a binomial probability calculator available online to get the exact probabilities, and then sum them up to find the desired probability.

Response B:
For a seat to be available for every passenger that shows up, at most 50 people can show up. This means either 0, 1, or 2 people who bought tickets do not show up. 

The probabilities for each of these three cases can be calculated using the binomial probability formula, which is:

P(k; n, p) = C(n, k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))

where:
P(k; n, p) is the probability of k successes in n trials,
C(n, k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time,
p is the probability of success on an individual trial,
k is the number of successes,
n is the number of trials.

The probability of 0 people not showing up is:

P(0; 52, 0.05) = C(52, 0) * (0.05^0) * ((1-0.05)^(52-0)) = 1 * 1 * (0.95^52) = 0.076

The probability of 1 person not showing up is:

P(1; 52, 0.05) = C(52, 1) * (0.05^1) * ((1-0.05)^(52-1)) = 52 * 0.05 * (0.95^51) = 0.201

The probability of 2 people not showing up is:

P(2; 52, 0.05) = C(52, 2) * (0.05^2) * ((1-0.05)^(52-2)) = 1326 * 0.0025 * (0.95^50) = 0.265

The total probability that there will be a seat available for every passenger that shows up is the sum of these three probabilities:

0.076 + 0.201 + 0.265 = 0.542 or 54.2%
