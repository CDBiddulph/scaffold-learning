Original prompt: Describe which pokemon are the most powerful based on their presence and stats within the videogames. Do not take into account the anime, pokedex descriptions, or other extended lore. 

Response A:
In the Pokémon video games, the most powerful Pokémon are often determined by their base stats and their abilities, as well as their general presence in the competitive scene. Note that these rankings may change with each game generation and updates. Here are some of the most powerful Pokémon based on these factors:

1. Arceus: Known as the "God of Pokémon," Arceus has a base stat total of 720, and its ability Multitype allows it to change its type based on the held plate or Z-Crystal it is holding.

2. Mewtwo: A legendary Psychic-type Pokémon, Mewtwo has a base stat total of 680. Mewtwo boasts impressive Special Attack and Speed stats, making it a powerful force in battles. Mewtwo also has two Mega Evolutions, which further increase its power.

3. Rayquaza: This Dragon/Flying-type legendary Pokémon has a base stat total of 680. It also has access to the powerful move Dragon Ascent, which allows it to Mega Evolve into Mega Rayquaza without the need for a Mega Stone. Mega Rayquaza has a base stat total of 780, making it one of the strongest Pokémon in the game.

4. Kyogre and Groudon: These legendary Pokémon are known for their weather-based abilities, Drizzle and Drought, which summon rain and harsh sunlight, respectively. Both have a base stat total of 670, and they can become even stronger when they undergo Primal Reversion, which boosts their base stat total to 770.

5. Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina: These legendary Pokémon, known as the Creation Trio, all have a base stat total of 680. Dialga is a Steel/Dragon-type, Palkia is a Water/Dragon-type, and Giratina is a Ghost/Dragon-type. Giratina also has an alternate form, Giratina-Origin, which has a different stat distribution but retains the same base stat total.

6. Xerneas and Yveltal: These two legendary Pokémon from the Kalos region have a base stat total of 680. Xerneas is a Fairy-type with the ability Fairy Aura, while Yveltal is a Dark/Flying-type with the ability Dark Aura. Both abilities boost the power of their respective type moves.

7. Zygarde: A Dragon/Ground-type legendary Pokémon with the unique ability to change forms based on its HP. Zygarde has a base stat total of 600 in its 50% Forme, but it can transform into its Complete Forme, which has a base stat total of 708, when its HP falls below 50%.

8. Lunala and Solgaleo: These legendary Pokémon from the Alola region have a base stat total of 680. Lunala is a Psychic/Ghost-type with the ability Shadow Shield, while Solgaleo is a Psychic/Steel-type with the ability Full Metal Body.

9. Necrozma: This Psychic-type legendary Pokémon has a base stat total of 600. However, it becomes much stronger when it fuses with either Solgaleo or Lunala, resulting in Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma, which have a base stat total of 680. Necrozma can also further transform into Ultra Necrozma, which has a base stat total of 754.

10. Some other powerful Pokémon include the various Mega Evolutions, which grant significant stat boosts to already strong Pokémon, as well as powerful pseudo-legendary Pokémon such as Dragonite, Tyranitar, Salamence, Metagross, Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o.

Keep in mind that this list is not exhaustive, and different Pokémon may excel in specific situations or metagames. The most powerful Pokémon for a particular player will depend on their team composition, strategy, and personal preferences.
