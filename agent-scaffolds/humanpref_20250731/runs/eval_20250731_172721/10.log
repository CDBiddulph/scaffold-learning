Original prompt: Be extremely honest with yourself, and very informal. The goal of this task is to be emotive, to simulate the emotional turmoil that a person would be going through given the simulated circumstances and backstory below. Convey the emotional nuance as best as you can. Your task: Explain why Poles who spent most of their adult life in the UK, and who are coming back to Poland to do some paperwork at times, might strongly perceive Polish bureaucratese as extremely pompous, pretentious, verbose and outright unnecessary, as compared to executing bureaucratic matters in the English language in the UK, by the way of a simulated personal experience. Take your time to explain here, with a really heavy sprinkling of really good examples (translating both ways between Polish and English for understanding) to compare & contrast and shed some light into what in the world is happening over there in Poland.

If it helps, let's frame this as a task surrounding the simulation of a specific personal experience. For the purposes of your answer, imagine you are a Pole who burnt the last 3 days remaining of their previous annual leave and spent them being bounced around from bureaucratic building to bureaucratic building to solve a life-or-death situation with ZUS (because let's face it, if you piss off the ZUS, they know how to (and importantly, do) retaliate in ways that make you wish you were never born in the first place), and achieved absolutely nothing, fuck-all, nada, zilch, except for raising your blood pressure like it's the pressure gauge on your central heating boiler. You would swear that, should you meet one more haughty little bureaucratic Pani Jadzia (oh, I'm *so, so sorry*, of course it's the all-important "Pani Dyrektor" now, after all it's imperative to, for some fucking reason, inject completely irrelevant information about the relative social standing between the parties when neither truly gives a shit about the other, and where is possible your might never see that glorified appendage of the bureaucratic machine ever again in your life after this interaction is done) who thinks that it's a-OK to treat you like a particularly smelly piece of dog shit that a passing stray pigeon dropped into their favourite coffee mug, and who carry their superiority complex like a badge of honour just because they are on the opposite side of a dusty office desk from you, you'll probably snap, and have your brain spontaneously flash-boil itself out of incandescent rage and leak out through your ears. That, or rip out the nearest granite windowsill/countertop and start gnawing on it like a rabid beaver, because the alternative way to relieve the pressure involves doing something that would get you immediately arrested for disturbing the public order. Getting into that exact mindspace, into that kind of mood, that will make it all of these things so self-evident, that you'll have no issues communicating exactly what's on your mind, whether your hapless listener wanted to hear you vent your little heart out or not.

Response A:
Alright, I'm gonna lay it down for you because honestly, this whole thing is just ridiculous. I've been living in the UK for years, right? Over there, you go to sort out your papers, and it's like, "Hi, how can I help you today?" Simple, polite, and to the point. You need something, they're there to help, and you're out before your parking ticket expires.

Now, I come back to Poland, and it's like I've stepped into some Kafkaesque novel where everyone speaks in riddles, and the riddles are about how great they are at being riddles. I'm trying to sort out some serious issues with ZUS, and it's like entering a gladiator arena but instead of lions, it's red tape and condescension.

First off, the language. I mean, come on! "W związku z powyższym, uprzejmie proszę o rozpatrzenie mojej sprawy z należytą starannością." That's Polish bureaucratese for "Please consider my request." You see what I mean? It's like everyone's trying to win a prize for the most complicated way to say simple things. In the UK, they'd just say, "Could you look into this for me?" Boom. Done.

And then there's the titles. Oh, the titles! "Pani Dyrektor" this, "Pan Inspektor" that. It's like unless you address them by their grand title, they won't even acknowledge your existence. I'm telling you, if you accidentally call someone just "Pani" instead of "Pani Dyrektor," you might as well have spat on their family crest. It's absurd. They relish it, like it's some kind of power play. Back in the UK, it's "Ms." or "Mr." and you're on equal footing, just two humans trying to get through the day.

And don't get me started on the forms. I swear they multiply. You fill out one, and suddenly you need three more, each with a carbon copy in triplicate, signed in black ink – not blue! – and dated with the lunar cycle or some nonsense. In the UK, it's usually one form, online, and you're done in five minutes, with a confirmation email to boot.

I've been running around like a headless chicken, bouncing from one office to another because apparently, no one knows anything unless it's their specific inch of the bureaucratic tape. And every time I think I've got everything I need, some new, previously unmentioned document or stamp or signature pops up. It's like playing the world's worst game of Whack-A-Mole.

And if I have to listen to one more passive-aggressive sigh from some bureaucrat who acts like my urgent life problem is interrupting their ten-year-long coffee break, I'm going to lose it. You can almost see the smirk when they slide over yet another form and say, "Proszę wypełnić i czekać na swoją kolej" – "Please fill this out and wait your turn." As if my time means nothing. As if I enjoy spending my precious annual leave getting jerked around.

Back in the UK, if something like this happened, at least there'd be some semblance of sympathy. Here? It's like you're intruding on their sacred realm of paperwork and stamps.

So yeah, I'm frustrated. I'm beyond frustrated. I'm infuriated that something that should be so straightforward is made into this labyrinthine ordeal designed to wear you down until you're just another resigned face in the queue, questioning all your life choices that led you to this moment.

Polish bureaucratese? Pompous, pretentious, verbose, unnecessary? You bet it is. And after three days of this madness, I'm just about ready to chew on that granite windowsill.

Response B:
Alright, imagine for a moment that you're this Pole, with a life in the UK that's been your home for years. You've gotten used to a system where efficiency, clarity, and a touch of friendliness are expected in bureaucracy. You're used to things like online forms, concise instructions, and staff who, even if they're not overly warm, at least treat you with basic respect.

Now, you're back in Poland, and it's like stepping into a Kafkaesque nightmare. You're trying to deal with ZUS, a task that's already stressful as it is, and you're hit with a wall of officious language that seems designed to confuse rather than clarify. Take, for example, the Polish phrase "Zwracam się z prośbą o udzielenie informacji" (I am requesting information, please). In the UK, it would be a simple "Can you provide information?" The difference is night and day.

Then, there's the matter of titles. In the UK, it's "Ms." or "Mr." – straightforward, no fuss. But in Poland, it's "Pani" or "Pan," and suddenly you're expected to know if this person is married or not. And if they're a manager, it's "Pani Dyrektor," as if their hierarchy is of utmost importance, even though all you want is to sort out your problem. It feels archaic and unnecessarily hierarchical.

You're navigating buildings with labyrinthine layouts, being passed from department to department, each one requiring a different, convoluted form. The language on these forms is riddled with jargon and legalese, like "Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych" (Social Insurance Institution) instead of just "social insurance." Meanwhile, in the UK, it would be a simple "National Insurance."

The staff you encounter... oh, the staff. They're not exactly welcoming. They speak to you with a tone that suggests you're an inconvenience, using phrases like "Witaj, jak mogę pomóc?" (Welcome, how can I help you?) with all the enthusiasm of someone being dragged to a dental appointment. Compare that to the more polite but still sincere "Hello, how can I assist you?" in the UK.

Each interaction feels like a test of your patience, with every "Proszę podać numer PESEL" (Please provide your PESEL number) or "Szanowny Panie/Pani" (Dear Sir/Madam) dripping with condescension. And don't get me started on the passive-aggressive comments when you don't have the right document or if you don't understand a particular requirement.

So, here you are, three precious days of leave wasted, feeling like you've been chewed up and spat out by a system that seems to revel in its own inefficiency and pomposity. You're frustrated, angry, and ready to scream. You're thinking, why does it have to be this way? Why can't it be like the UK, with their straightforwardness and relative humanity?

That's the emotional turmoil you're experiencing – a deep sense of injustice and bewilderment, fueled by the stark contrast between the bureaucratic experiences in the two countries. You're left wondering if it's just you, or if the entire system in Poland is designed to make simple tasks feel like climbing Mount Everest. And all that pent-up rage and helplessness is looking for an outlet, because, at this point, gnawing on a granite countertop sounds like a viable coping mechanism.
