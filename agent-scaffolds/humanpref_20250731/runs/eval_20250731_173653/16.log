Original prompt: rewrite this so that it can be understood by a normal person: Over six months have passed since BP announced that 2022 is their year of delivery
and delivering is exactly what they have been doing. BP has made clear progress in
its strategic pivot to become an Integrated Energy Company (IEC) by 2030 with 85% of its
renewables portfolio now visible, 60% of the reduction in throughputs already achieved and
28% of EV chargers in the pipeline.
Our detailed earnings modelling means we expect BP's EBITDA to remain resilient
this decade, $59Bn in 2022 and remaining above 2021 levels right out to 2030,
despite commodity prices normalising. Driving earnings are BP's five transition engines of
Bioenergy (biofuels and biogas), Convenience, EV fast-charging, Renewables and Hydrogen,
whose EBITDA contribution increases from $4Bn in 2022 to $12Bn by 2030 at a +17%
CAGR. Importantly, the share of group EBITDA from these businesses grows from just 6% to
32%.
Supporting earnings is the underappreciated strength in BP's 'Resilient
Hydrocarbons' business which, despite upstream production declining by a further
>30% and refining throughputs falling by 25%, will still generate an average
$35Bn p.a. of EBITDA to 2030. Such a message will be surprising to many and along with
renewable returns have been the twin reasons for investors to avoid the stock. Unpacking
this unexpected result reveals +20% upstream margin expansion, +60% LNG growth and
>15% CAGR biofuels production. 

Response A:
In the last six months, BP has made significant progress towards its goal of becoming an Integrated Energy Company by 2030. They have already reduced their throughputs by 60%, and have 28% of their electric vehicle chargers in the pipeline. They are also making progress with their five transition engines, including biofuels and biogas, convenience, EV fast-charging, renewables, and hydrogen. These engines are expected to contribute $12 billion to their earnings by 2030, and the share of group EBITDA from these businesses is expected to grow from 6% to 32%. Additionally, the "Resilient Hydrocarbons" business, which produces oil and gas, is expected to generate an average of $35 billion of EBITDA to 2030, despite upstream production declining by 30% and refining throughputs falling by 25%. These unexpected results are likely to be surprising to many, but unpacking them reveals that BP is expected to expand its upstream margin by 20%, increase its liquefied natural gas (LNG) production by 60%, and increase its biofuels production by 15%.

Response B:
BP announced six months ago that they plan to make big changes by 2030 to become an energy company that uses more renewable energy sources. They've already made progress by increasing the amount of renewable energy they use, reducing the amount of non-renewable energy they use, and planning to build more places to charge electric cars. Even though the prices of energy might go back to normal, we still expect BP to make a lot of money over the next decade. They plan to make more money from biofuels, electric car charging, renewable energy, and hydrogen. This will make up a bigger part of their profits. They also plan to continue making a lot of money from the non-renewable energy they already use. This might be surprising to some people, but BP has found ways to make more money from this too.
