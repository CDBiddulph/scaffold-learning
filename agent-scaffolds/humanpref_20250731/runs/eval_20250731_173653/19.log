Original prompt: What is 80-2/2?

Response A:
To solve the expression 80 - 2/2, you need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction).

According to PEMDAS, you should perform division before subtraction. So, you first divide 2 by 2, and then subtract the result from 80.

2 / 2 = 1

Now subtract that result from 80:

80 - 1 = 79

So, 80 - 2/2 equals 79.

Response B:
The answer to 80 - 2 / 2 is 79.
