Original prompt: Create me background story for elven female rogue. Her parents were killed in front of her eyes by someone, she had to escape trough woods as a little child. She was found by rogue faction member and raised.

Response A:
As a child, the rogue faction member who found her took her in and raised her as one of their own. They taught her how to survive in the woods and how to use her agility and quick thinking to her advantage. Despite the grief and trauma of losing her parents, she grew up strong and independent, determined to one day make her way in the world. 
As she grew older, she began to develop a talent for thievery and deception, honing her skills in secret until she felt ready to strike out on her own. She traveled the land, stealing from the rich to give to the poor and using her charm and quick wit to avoid detection. 
Eventually, she stumbled upon a powerful artifact that was sought after by many powerful forces. Desperate to keep the artifact out of their grasp, the rogue faction member who had raised her stepped in to help. Together, they navigated the dangers and obstacles that lay ahead, using their skills to outsmart their enemies and claim the artifact for themselves. 
In the end, they emerged victorious, and the artifact was used to help those in need and bring justice to the world. The elven female rogue had proven herself to be a force to be reckoned with, and her legend lived on long after her journey was complete.

Response B:
Your elven female rogue was born into a small elven village nestled deep within the forest. She had a happy childhood, playing with the other children and dreaming of adventure. However, her life took a dark turn when she was just a young child.

One day, a group of orcs came to her village, slaughtering anyone who got in their way. Your character's parents were among the victims, and she was the only survivor. She managed to escape the village and flee into the forest, where she wandered lost and alone for days.

Just when she thought she couldn't go on any longer, she was found by a rogue faction member. He took her in and trained her in the ways of the rogue, teaching her how to steal, pick locks, and fight. Over time, she became an integral part of the faction, using her skills to help them complete their missions.

Despite the fact that she was an orphan, your character never lost her sense of elven pride. She wore her long, flowing hair in a single plait down her back and favored elven clothing. She carried herself with a grace and poise that belied her rough upbringing, and her eyes sparkled with a fierce determination.

Now, your character is a skilled and deadly rogue, ready to take on any challenge that comes her way. She may have a personal vendetta against the group that killed her parents, but she channels that anger into her work, using it to fuel her success as a rogue.
