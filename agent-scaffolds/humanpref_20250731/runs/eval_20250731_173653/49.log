=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: Given example : 
[1,2,"ADA","BEBE",5,6,3,223-332,112-223,"GAGA",'DATA','2Der','3Gev',43,12,332-123,122-643,"Ze23Der']

output should be: 
{
ID : [D223-332,D112-223, D332-123,D122-653],
Key : ['ADA','BEBE','GAGA','DATA',]
Pair : ['2Der', '3Gev', 'Ze23Der']
}

Now given new input generate the similar output

[2,4,2,3,5,67,75,4,2,1,34,5,3,323,432,223-443,113-776,'3Vza','65Fga','654AS','DAMEN','DAMN','SANTA',434-112]

output should be :



Response A:
{
ID : [D223-443, D113-776, D434-112],
Key : ['DAMEN', 'DAMN', 'SANTA'],
Pair : ['3Vza', '65Fga', '654AS']
}

Response B:
Here is the output for the given input:

{
ID: [D223-443,D113-776,D434-112],  
Key: ['3Vza','65Fga','654AS','DAMEN','DAMN','SANTA'],
Pair: []
}

I have categorized the input data into IDs, Keys and Pairs based on the logic from your example:

- ID contains any item that has a D followed by a dash separated range
- Key contains any string items surrounded by ' single quotes
- Pair contains any items that look like letter/number combinations with no quotes

Everything else is ignored. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional examples to test!

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
