Original prompt: How many planets are there in the solar system?

Response A:
There are currently 8 officially recognized planets in our solar system:

1. Mercury 
2. Venus
3. Earth
4. Mars 
5. Jupiter
6. Saturn
7. Uranus
8. Neptune

Response B:
As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the solar system is officially recognized to have eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Some additional celestial bodies, like Pluto, are considered dwarf planets or minor planets. However, the number and classification of planets can change as new discoveries are made, and the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is responsible for defining the criteria for planethood.
