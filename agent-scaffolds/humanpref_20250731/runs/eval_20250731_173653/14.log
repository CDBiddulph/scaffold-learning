Original prompt: What are the affirmative defenses for a breach of contract lawsuit

Response A:
There are several affirmative defenses to a breach of contract lawsuit. These defenses include:

* **Statute of limitations.** A statute of limitations is a law that sets a time limit on how long a person can sue for a breach of contract. If the person sues after the statute of limitations has expired, the court will dismiss their case.
* **Waiver.** A waiver is a contract provision that allows one party to breach the contract without liability. If the other party agrees to the waiver, they cannot later sue for breach of contract.
* **Excusable delay.** If a party is delayed in performing their contractual obligations due to circumstances beyond their control, they may be excused from liability for breach of contract.
* **Anticipatory breach.** An anticipatory breach occurs when one party to a contract announces that they will not perform their obligations under the contract. The other party can then sue for breach of contract even if the contract has not yet been breached.
* **Impossibility of performance.** If a party is unable to perform their contractual obligations due to circumstances beyond their control, they may be excused from liability for breach of contract.
* **Frustration of purpose.** If a contract becomes impossible to perform or substantially different from what the parties intended due to circumstances beyond the parties' control, the contract may be frustrated and the parties may be excused from liability for breach of contract.

It is important to note that these are just a few of the affirmative defenses that can be used in a breach of contract lawsuit. Each case is unique, and the specific defenses that may be available will depend on the facts of the case.
