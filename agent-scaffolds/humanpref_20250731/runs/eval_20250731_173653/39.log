Response A:
As the days go by, Darius and Calvin continue to hang out and be great friends. However, Darius begins to notice that something is not quite right with Calvin. He always seems a little too eager to spend time with him, and there is a certain edge to his laughter that Darius can't quite put his finger on.

One night, as they are hanging out in Calvin's house, Darius mentioned that he had something important to do. Calvin nods and says he understand. But Darius knows that something is off. As they say their goodbyes and Darius heads out, he feels a strange sense of unease.

The next morning, Darius checks on Calvin and finds that he is gone. He tries to call him but there's no answer. As he checks on his other friends, he realizes that they all seem to be avoiding him. Darius becomes more and more panicked as he realizes that something is seriously wrong with Calvin.

As the days go by, Darius becomes more and more desperate to find out what's going on. He finally manages to track down Calvin and finds him in a remote location. Calvin looks at him with a cold, calculating gaze.

"I've been watching you," he says. "And I know what you're thinking. You're wondering what's going on, right?"

Darius nods, and Calvin's eyes widen in a sinister way.

"I wanted to see if you were truly friends or if you were just using me for my own ends," he continues. "I can sense the power you have, and I want to use it for my own gain."

Darius's heart sinks as he realizes that Calvin is indeed a dark entity, and that he had been using him all along. He panics and tries to run, but it's too late. Calvin's eyes turn cold and lifeless, and Darius falls to the ground, unable to resist the entity's hold.

Title: A Friendship Betrayed

Setting: Modern day, urban city

Plot Idea:

Darius, a handsome model in his early 20s, is famous for his funny personality and charming smile. He has a large following on social media, and his face is well-known in the industry. One day, he meets Calvin, another model, during a photoshoot. Darius is immediately struck by Calvin's charming personality, and they soon become great friends.

As their friendship grows, Darius starts to notice a change in Calvin's behavior. Calvin, unbeknownst to Darius, is a dark entity that feeds on the energy of others. He has been sent to prey on Darius, but as he spends more time with him, he finds himself unable to bring himself to hurt him.

One night, as they hang out at Calvin's house, Calvin reveals his true nature to Darius. Darius is terrified, but something inside Calvin prevents him from attacking. Darius, showing great courage and empathy, accepts Calvin as he is, and their friendship rekindles. Darius becomes the first human that Calvin has befriended, and the two grow closer.

However, one night, Darius fails to show up for their planned sleepover. Worried, Calvin goes to Darius's house, only to find him hanging in the living room by his scarf, his eyes staring blankly, his mouth open, and swaying slightly. Despite being a dark entity himself, Calvin is horrified by the sight. He rushes to save Darius and unties the scarf, making Darius fall into his arms.

Calvin embraces Darius and gently lays him on the carpet. He checks for a pulse, but there is none. Darius, in a state of shock, screams for Calvin to get up, but Calvin remains silent, staring blankly. Darius shakes Calvin, begging him to respond. He takes Darius into his lap and cries, gently shutting Darius's eyes.

Throughout the story, we delve into the themes of friendship, trust, and the struggle between dark and light. Calvin must come to
