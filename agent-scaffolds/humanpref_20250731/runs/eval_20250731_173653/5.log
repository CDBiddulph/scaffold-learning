Original prompt: Molar mass CuCl2

Response A:
Here are the steps to calculate the molar mass of CuCl2:

1) Write the chemical formula: CuCl2

2) Look up the atomic masses:
Cu = 63.546 g/mol
Cl = 35.453 g/mol 

3) Determine the subscripts:
Cu = 1 atom
Cl = 2 atoms

4) Multiply the atomic mass by the number of atoms of each element:
Cu = 63.546 g/mol 
Cl = 2 * 35.453 g/mol = 70.906 g/mol

5) Add up the individual contributions:
Cu = 63.546 g/mol
Cl = 70.906 g/mol
Total = 63.546 + 70.906 = 134.452 g/mol

Therefore, the molar mass of CuCl2 is 134.452 g/mol.

Response B:
The molar mass of CuCl2 is 134.45 g/mol.
