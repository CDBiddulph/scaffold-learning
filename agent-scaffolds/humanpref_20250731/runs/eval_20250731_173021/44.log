Original prompt: What is 2*9*(6%4)+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9? Show your work.

Response A:
To solve this arithmetic expression, let's break it down step by step following the order of operations, which is parentheses first, then exponents (if any), followed by multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

Here's the original expression:
2 * 9 * (6 % 4) + 6 - 4000 / 56 + 123 / 321 + 40 / 2 + 9

Let's solve it step by step:

First, solve the modulus (remainder) operation in parentheses:
6 % 4 = 2 (since 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2)

Now the expression looks like this:
2 * 9 * 2 + 6 - 4000 / 56 + 123 / 321 + 40 / 2 + 9

Next, we'll do the multiplication operations:
2 * 9 * 2 = 18 * 2 = 36

Continue the operations in order:
40 / 2 = 20

Now our expression is:
36 + 6 - 4000 / 56 + 123 / 321 + 20 + 9

Next, we'll perform the division operations:
4000 / 56 = 71.4285714286 (rounded to 10 decimal places)
123 / 321 = 0.3831775701 (rounded to 10 decimal places)

Now our expression is:
36 + 6 - 71.4285714286 + 0.3831775701 + 20 + 9

Finally, we'll do the addition and subtraction from left to right:
36 + 6 = 42
42 - 71.4285714286 ≈ -29.4285714286
-29.4285714286 + 0.3831775701 ≈ -29.0453938585
-29.0453938585 + 20 = -9.0453938585
-9.0453938585 + 9 = -0.0453938585

So the final result of the expression, rounded to ten decimal places, is approximately:
-0.0453938585

If you're looking for an exact answer without rounding, you would need to calculate with the exact fractions, not decimals. However, since the question did not specify the need for an exact fraction, the above answer provides a close approximation.

Response B:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
2*9 = 18
(6%4) = 2 (remainder of 6 divided by 4)
18*(6%4) = 18*2 = 36
36+6 = 42
4000/56 = 71 (rounded)
123/321 = 0 (rounded)
40/2 = 20
20+9 = 29
42 - 71 + 0 + 29 = 0

Therefore, 2*9*(6%4)+6-4000/56+123/321+40/2+9 = 0
