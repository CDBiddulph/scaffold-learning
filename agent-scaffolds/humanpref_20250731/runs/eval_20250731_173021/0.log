Original prompt: How many computers can a banana drink while flying on a bike driven by a cat?

Response A:
Bananas, computers, bikes and cats are all inanimate objects or animals that lack the ability to perform actions like drinking or driving. The question doesn't make literal sense.

Response B:
It is not possible to determine how many computers a banana drink can while flying on a bike driven by a cat because it is an illogical question. Computers require electricity and cannot be powered by a banana drink. Bikes require human effort or an engine to be powered and cannot fly. Cats cannot drive bikes or fly.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
