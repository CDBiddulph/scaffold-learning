Original prompt: A 32.7-g sample of NaCl dissolves in 95.2-g of water in a calorimeter. The temperature goes from 19.5°C to 25.0°C. Find H for the process.
NaCl (s) → Na (aq) + Cl (aq)
DeltaH = -3.9kJ/mol Show me how this equation is worked out.

Response A:
To find the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the process, we can use the equation:

ΔH = q / n

where q is the heat absorbed or released by the reaction and n is the amount of substance in moles.

First, we need to calculate the amount of NaCl in moles. We can use the molar mass of NaCl (58.44 g/mol) to convert the mass of NaCl to moles:

moles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl
moles of NaCl = 32.7 g / 58.44 g/mol
moles of NaCl = 0.56 mol

Next, we need to calculate the heat absorbed or released by the reaction (q). We can use the equation:

q = m * c * ΔT

where m is the mass of the solution, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

The mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of NaCl and the mass of water:

mass of solution = mass of NaCl + mass of water
mass of solution = 32.7 g + 95.2 g
mass of solution = 127.9 g

The specific heat capacity of water is approximately 4.18 J/g°C.

ΔT = final temperature - initial temperature
ΔT = 25.0°C - 19.5°C
ΔT = 5.5°C

Now we can calculate q:

q = m * c * ΔT
q = 127.9 g * 4.18 J/g°C * 5.5°C
q = 2960.3 J

Finally, we can calculate ΔH using the equation:

ΔH = q / n
ΔH = 2960.3 J / 0.56 mol
ΔH = 5282.3 J/mol

To convert this value to kilojoules per mole, we divide by 1000:

ΔH = 5282.3 J/mol / 1000
ΔH = 5.28 kJ/mol

Therefore, the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the process is approximately -5.28 kJ/mol.

Response B:
1. **Calculate the moles of NaCl dissolved.**

Moles of NaCl = mass of NaCl / molar mass of NaCl

Moles of NaCl = 32.7 g / 58.44 g/mol

Moles of NaCl = 0.559 mol


2. **Calculate the heat absorbed by the water.**

Heat absorbed by water = mass of water * specific heat of water * change in temperature

Heat absorbed by water = 95.2 g * 4.184 J/g°C * (25.0°C - 19.5°C)

Heat absorbed by water = 2189 J


3. **Calculate the heat released by the NaCl dissolution.**

Heat released by NaCl dissolution = -ΔH * moles of NaCl

Heat released by NaCl dissolution = -(3.9 kJ/mol) * (0.559 mol)

Heat released by NaCl dissolution = -2.18 kJ


4. **Calculate the total heat change for the process.**

Total heat change = heat absorbed by water + heat released by NaCl dissolution

Total heat change = 2189 J + (-2.18 kJ)

Total heat change = -1.96 kJ


5. **Calculate the enthalpy change per mole of NaCl dissolved.**

Enthalpy change per mole of NaCl dissolved = total heat change / moles of NaCl

Enthalpy change per mole of NaCl dissolved = -1.96 kJ / 0.559 mol

Enthalpy change per mole of NaCl dissolved = -3.51 kJ/mol


Therefore, the enthalpy change for the process is -3.51 kJ/mol.
