Then I talk about programs and language, who understands what, and present some Steven Pinker’s reservations about large language models (LLMs) and correlative beliefs in their prepotency.
That is not the case with the large language models produced by machine learning (ML).
For that reason I’m going to skip over Pinker’s remarks on that point.
The point I’ve been getting at is that I don’t think AI experts are in a position to make that judgment.
“And if [AI models] are much smarter than us, they’ll be very good at manipulating us.

Response A:
The article discusses programs and language, focusing on Steven Pinker's reservations about large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities.

Pinker's concerns highlight the limitations of current AI models in understanding and manipulating human language.

Response B:
Here's a summary of the article in less than 300 characters:

Steven Pinker raises concerns about large language models (LLMs) and their potential to manipulate humans. However, AI experts may not be equipped to assess their capabilities.
