Original prompt: How many digits does pi have?

Response A:
Pi is an irrational number, which means it cannot be exactly expressed as a finite decimal or fraction. It continues indefinitely without repeating. Therefore, pi has an infinite number of digits. The decimal representation of pi has been calculated to trillions of digits, but it still does not end.

Response B:
Pi is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed as a finite decimal or a fraction. It has an infinite number of digits that do not follow a specific pattern. However, for most practical uses, it is often approximated as 3.14 or 3.14159.
