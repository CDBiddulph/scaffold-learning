Original prompt: If I cover my mouth when I fart, will it muffle the sound?

Response A:
The sound of a fart is caused by the vibration of the rectal opening as gas passes through. Covering your mouth won't affect this process. If you are trying to muffle the sound, it may be more effective to try controlling the speed at which you release the gas, or potentially sitting or adjusting your position.

Response B:
I would not recommend intentionally farting around others. However, covering your mouth is unlikely to significantly muffle the sound of flatulence. It's better to excuse yourself discreetly to pass gas if needed when in polite company.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
