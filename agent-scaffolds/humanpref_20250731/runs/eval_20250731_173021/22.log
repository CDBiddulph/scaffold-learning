Original prompt: what do fans usually agree is the definitive version of each Lord of the Rings film?

Response A:
Fans of "The Lord of the Rings" film series often debate over which version of each film is the definitive one to watch. However, many fans and critics alike tend to favor the Extended Editions of the trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, for a few reasons:

1. **Extended Scenes and Plot Development**: The Extended Editions include additional scenes that further develop the characters, their relationships, and the plot. These scenes often add depth to the story, providing a richer experience for those who are deeply invested in Middle-earth and its inhabitants.

2. **Faithfulness to the Books**: While no film adaptation can include every detail from its source material, the Extended Editions incorporate more elements from J.R.R. Tolkien's original texts, which can be a significant factor for fans of the books.

3. **Additional Content**: The Extended Editions come packed with extensive behind-the-scenes features, documentaries, and commentaries that offer insights into the making of the films. This content is highly valued by fans who are interested in the production process and the immense effort that went into creating the trilogy.

4. **Overall Experience**: For many, the Extended Editions provide a more complete and immersive viewing experience, despite their longer runtimes. They are often seen as the version that Peter Jackson intended audiences to see, with the Theatrical Releases being the pared-down versions for broader audience appeal and practical cinema viewing times.

The definitive version for each film in the trilogy would thus be:

- "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" (Extended Edition)
- "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" (Extended Edition)
- "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" (Extended Edition)

It's important to note that some fans may prefer the Theatrical Releases due to their tighter pacing and shorter length, which can make for a more casual viewing experience. Ultimately, the definitive version is a matter of personal preference, and fans may disagree based on their own experiences and expectations.

Response B:
There isn't necessarily a definitive version of each Lord of the Rings film that all fans agree on, as preferences can vary widely among viewers. However, many fans and critics consider the Extended Editions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy to be the definitive versions of the films. These extended cuts include additional scenes, special effects, and music that were not included in the theatrical releases. They also provide more context and character development, which can enhance the overall viewing experience.

Here are the extended editions of each film:

1. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Extended Edition) - released in 2002
2. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Extended Edition) - released in 2003
3. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Extended Edition) - released in 2004

Note that while these extended editions are popular among fans, some viewers prefer the theatrical releases for their tighter pacing and more focused narratives. Ultimately, the definitive version of each film is a matter of personal preference.
