**Solving puzzle clues**

I’m working through some crossword clues. For "Major purchase when furnishing a dining room," I think "TABLE" fits. The clue "6. Reprimanding sounds" might point to "tut-tut," and "10. ___ de gallo" is clearly "PICO." For "14. White wetland wader," I'm leaning towards "egret." Now for “15. Company name...” I’m considering "IKEA" since it relates to furniture. I’m also pondering if “investment” or something else might fit. It’s a bit tricky!

**Working through crossword clues**

I’m analyzing some crossword clues here. For clue 22, “*Hobbes, vis-à-vis Calvin,” I think the answer is “tiger” since Hobbes is a tiger. For clue 46, “*Cryptid in the Scottish Highlands,” I suspect “loch ness” fits. Moving down the clues, for Vietnamese New Year, I believe the answer is “TET.” “Sis’s sibling” would then be “bro,” and “What are you waiting for?!” is likely “now.” I'm pondering the other clues as well, trying to confirm answers.

**Creating a filled grid**

I'm working on producing a 15-row grid from the input black squares. My plan is to fill each empty square with "A" for consistency. For example, row 1 contains "A A A A A . A A A A . A A A A." 

I need to be careful with row counts. Like for row 3, the input says it should contain 10 "A" plus one dot, so I need to adjust accordingly.

I'll double-check the other rows to ensure I'm keeping everything accurate while filling in spaces correctly!
