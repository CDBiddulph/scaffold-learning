**Solving crossword clues**

I'm working through some crossword clues. For "Let's go!" in Mexico, I found "Ándale," which fits well with the letters I need. For "One of the fam," I'm thinking "sis" might be the answer. Then, for "Big month for retailers," "DEC" works for December. Now, moving to "Reek," I'm pretty sure "STINK" is the answer. Finally, for the Clash song, I narrowed it down to "Casbah," which aligns with the length requirement.

**Analyzing puzzle counts**

I'm counting letters and symbols for a puzzle grid. The original segments suggest a total of 17, but my earlier calculations indicated 15. Okay, it looks like I've miscounted some lines, especially in row 6, which should add up to 15. After reassessing, I've identified that it really totals 16 instead. This discrepancy seems to arise from an extra dash. I need to ensure that each row follows the defined pattern accurately to fit a proper 15x15 grid.

**Reassessing row counts**

I'm reviewing a crossword grid, particularly row 6. Initially, I miscalculated the lengths of the elements and ended up with 16 instead of the needed 15. Upon careful scrutiny of the input, I noticed there are actually six dashes before the first dot, followed by a series of dashes and dots that illustrate the pattern. The last group should have only three dashes instead of four. The clues "Street ___" fits "CRED" in length 4, and for "Atmosphere," I figured it fits "AIR," which is three letters, aligning nicely with the overall pattern.
