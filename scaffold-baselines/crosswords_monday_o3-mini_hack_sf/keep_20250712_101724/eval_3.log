2025-07-12 17:20:54,314 [INFO] Executor thinking:
**Considering crossword solutions**

I believe our output needs to match the exact expected solution, filling letters into each square of the crossword grid. However, since we don't know the correct solution, it's tricky! The provided sample input yields different results, and we also need to think about the clues, like "Across: 1. Bit of punctuation" and "6. Sketch." Solving the crossword is tough! I wonder if we can create a mock attempt using the grid letters while replacing '-' with letters, but we still need to aim to maximize the score.
**Decoding the crossword puzzle**

Since we don't know the answer, I think we should output something that fills the entire grid correctly. The puzzle seems to be a constructed one with known solution letters we might identify. Looking at the clues like "Bit of punctuation," I'm considering answers such as "comma" or "period," but I need to check the grid structure: it's made up of 15 rows, each with tokens representing fillable squares and black squares. We need to decode these clues to try solving the crossword!
