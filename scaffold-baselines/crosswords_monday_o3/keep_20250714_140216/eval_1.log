2025-07-14 21:14:36,356 [INFO] Executor thinking:
I'm working on filling out a crossword puzzle with a 15x15 grid. I've got to represent the grid using '-' for fillable squares and '.' for black squares. To keep track, I'll transcribe the grid by row and index the coordinates. For example, Row 1 has some letters and black squares, giving me a pattern for filling. The first across clue is "Handle difficult matters satisfactorily," which has 4 letters and the answer is "COPE." This fits perfectly in the grid!

I'm working on filling out the crossword. For clue 5, a device connected to a router, I find "MODEM" fits perfectly, so I'll place M-O-D-E-M in Row 1. For clue 10, "Song syllables," I’m considering "LA LA" or "LAHS," but I’ll leave it blank for now. Moving to Row 2, for clue 14 about a gemstone, "OPAL" fits, and I place O-P-A-L. Next, clue 15, referring to the election victor of 2008 and 2012, is "OBAMA," which fits. Then, clue 16, "ORAL," fits as well. Row 3 presents a long clue for disciplinary infractions, "PERMANENT RECORD." That fits too!

I'm mapping out letters for the crossword. In Row 4, I've filled in "ANT" for the clue about an insect in a colony, and "MAYA" fits for the actress clue. The clue about Fairbanks being in "ALASKA" also fits well. 

Moving to Row 5, I see I might have some blanks and black squares to account for, identifying "IDOL" as the answer for the "American ___" clue. I have "COOPS" for pigeon shelters, too. Now, Row 6 has a bit of a challenge with counting the characters accurately — it looks like I might be miscounting the dashes and dots. Let's sort that out!

I'm mapping out letters, and I've determined that "ELM" fits the clue from "A Nightmare on ___ Street." For the painting known for its smile, "MONALISA" fits perfectly! 

I also filled in "OBEY," "DANA," and "EMT." Now I'm working on "MARACA" for another clue. When tackling the clue about finding something on a map, "LOCATES" is a good match, and I figured out that "COOPS" should actually be "COTES" for pigeon shelters. I'm making good progress, correcting where needed!

I'm wrapping up the crossword clues. For Down #58, I've figured out that "SIS" fits as Bro's sibling, and for Down #59, "MTV" is the network that aired "Jersey Shore." Now that those are solved, I'm filling in the across entries. "LALA," "HIGHYIELD CD," and "SCENE" are confirmed. 

I found "APEMAN" for the missing link clue, which also fits perfectly. Lastly, I can see that "SINGLESTREAMING" completes another phrase. I'll continue to verify and finalize these entries!
