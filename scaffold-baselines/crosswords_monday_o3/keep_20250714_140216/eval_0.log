**Decoding crossword puzzle grid**

I’m tackling a crossword puzzle where I need to provide an attempted solution string using the grid layout. The grid is typically 15x15 with '-' for fillable squares and '.' for black squares. To maximize my score, I’ll guess answers based on the clues without knowing the expected solution. My goal is to create a solution string that follows this format, using letters for fillable squares and dots for black squares. Let’s decode the grid and get started!

**Reconstructing the grid**

I’m working on reconstructing the crossword grid row by row. The first two rows share a pattern of fillable squares and black squares with a format of four letters, a dot, then three letters, another dot, and finally six letters. Row three has a different structure, with eight letters followed by a dot and six letters. I need to ensure every row contains exactly 15 tokens. I’ll keep double-checking the tokens as I lay them out for accuracy.

**Filling in the grid clues**

I'm continuing to work on the crossword grid by examining each row for tokens. For Row 7, I confirm it has 15 tokens, and Row 8 begins with a dot too. I’ll verify all rows have the correct token counts. As I analyze Row 1, I can see the first clue hints at "Christmas baubles," leading me to "ORBS." Then, I identify different across clues for the subsequent letters, like "CBC" for the Ontario network, and "CAROMS" for billiard bounces, checking that lengths match.

**Updating crossword progress**

I’m analyzing the rows of my crossword grid. I’m filling in letters like 'C' in Row 1, leading to “CYMBAL” down. I’ve got “BAILS” for the clue about backing out, and finding “COXES” fits the rowing crew captains clue. I can also verify “COS” and “AVE” for trigonometry and hymns respectively. For patterns like “RECENT” and “OR ELSE”, everything aligns perfectly. I’m now looking at new starting positions for Down clues, such as “Kama Sutra” and “STEADY.”
