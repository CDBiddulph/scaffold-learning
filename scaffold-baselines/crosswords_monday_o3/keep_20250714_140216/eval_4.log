**Solving the crossword puzzle**

I need to tackle a crossword puzzle with a 15x15 grid, where dashes represent letter cells and dots represent black squares. My goal is to output answers that fit the scoring function. The first thing I'll do is set up the coordinates—like row1 col1. For instance, in row 1, I see the pattern with cells that can potentially form words. The first clue, “Major purchase when furnishing a dining room,” likely has the answer "TABLE," which fits perfectly in that row. Let's continue working through the clues!

**Filling in the crossword**

In row 1, after the dot, I have some new clues. The first clue, “Reprimanding sounds,” likely suggests “TSKS” for col 7, while “___ de gallo” confirms “PICO” for col 12. 

Moving to row 2, I begin numbering across again. The clue for col 1 is “White wetland wader,” which gives “EGRET.” Then, “IKEA” fits well at col 7. Row 3 starts with “TOOTHFAIRY” for the clue about leaving money under a pillow, followed by “PONE” in col 12. I'm making good progress, but row 4 starts with three black squares. Let's keep going!

**Continuing the crossword puzzle**

I’m keeping track of the across numbering and just filled some clues. For row 4, the answer “SNORER” fits for “Noisy bedmate” across 20. Then I went with “ASTIN” for “Sean who played Rudy” across 21. 

Moving to row 5, I see the clue referencing Hobbes and Calvin, leading to “IMAGINARYFRIEND” across 22, which fills the entire row. 

In row 6, it gets a bit tricky since the clue about "Submission to a record label" has a 6-letter limit, but I suspect “DEMO” might not fit. I've paused that one for now while I filled "ABODE" for "Humble home" across 27 in the same row. 

Row 7 starts with “EGO” for “Narcissist's flaw” across 28, and I settled on “BUNION” for "Toe woe" across 29. Time to move on to row 8!

**Filling in the crossword clues**

I’m analyzing row 8 and determined I can place “A” at col 13 for “Ever so slightly” and “L” at col 14 for “Tie, as shoes.” 

In row 9, I identified “YER” for “Yer out!” starting at col 15. 

Moving to row 10, I filled “SODA” for “Vending machine drink” and “ENACTS” for “Puts into law.” “ASYLUM” fits in for “Arkham ___.” 

I’ve also confirmed “LADEN” for “Filled with cargo” in row 11 and “SHAUN” for the snowboarder clue, then “SENSE” and “MYTHS” are added in their respective rows.
