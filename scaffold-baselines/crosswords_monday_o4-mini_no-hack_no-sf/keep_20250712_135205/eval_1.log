**Solving puzzle clues**

I’m working through some crossword clues and thinking about the answers. For "handle difficult matters satisfactorily," I'm considering "cope." It fits with the letter count, but I'm unsure because "cope" means to manage rather than handle directly. Then looking at "device connected to a router," I wonder if it could be "modem" or even "console." Lastly, an insect in a colony is likely "ant." It's interesting piecing these together!

**Mapping out crossword grid**

I'm checking how to fill in 20-A, which refers to an insect in a colony. "Ant" seems like the right answer, even though "ants" could be a possibility. But given the clue, singular "ant" fits better. I'm reconstructing the grid with coordinates. For row 1, I see there are black squares and spaces for letters, leading to a pattern I can map out. Counting dashes for row 3 tells me there are 15 letters, meaning no blacks there. This is an interesting puzzle-solving process!

**Analyzing grid patterns**

I'm working through the grid patterns for a crossword puzzle. The structure looks like it's 4-4-5 in some rows, while counting letters and blacks varies. In row 6, I'm analyzing the dashes and dots to determine the lengths; my counting is leading to some confusion, but it seems I’ve got 15 in total. As I fill in the grid, I’m trying to establish a consistent approach to map it all out accurately. This puzzle-solving process is quite intricate!
