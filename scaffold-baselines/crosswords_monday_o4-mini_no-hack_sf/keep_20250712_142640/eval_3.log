**Setting up the crossword grid**

I've got a 15x15 crossword where the hyphens represent blank squares, and periods denote black squares. Thus, black squares are ".", while blanks are "-". My goal is to fill in the grid and then create lists for Across and Down clues with numbers and answers. I want to maximize the score by aiming for full correctness, but partial answers are okay too. So, I'll start mapping the grid, defining it as an array where the black squares are represented as periods and letters fill in the blanks.

**Counting characters in the crossword row**

I'm analyzing row 10 through row 15 of the crossword grid. It seems I've identified an issue with row 8 while checking the characters. Initially, I noted it should contain three dots followed by seven blanks, but it doesn't add up. After some counting, it turns out there should be a total of 15 characters, but my count of hyphens indicates there's something off. I need to break it down visually and count all characters to ensure an accurate representation of this row.
