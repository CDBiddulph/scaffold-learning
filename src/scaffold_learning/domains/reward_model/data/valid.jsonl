As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.\nThe simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.\nEMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.\nI do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.\nIf there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.\n:fire:\n1\n\n\n\nJoe Marsh\n:red_wolves:  4:21 PM\nI'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -\nThe short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.\nCMC/ Forward Dynamics:\nRequires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations\nRequires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles\nThe final product will *basically always require force plates\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels\nI say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need\ntbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here\nBertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again\nEMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles\nSimulations:\nDon't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)\nDon't require EMG data at all, really\nForce plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above\ne.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat\ne.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)\nFinal product here doesn't necessarily require force plates\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ\nit's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates\nIt's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.\nThere's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete\nincrease your velo by doing XYZ\ndecrease your arm stress by doing ABC\noptimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK\nThat's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "scoring_data": {}}

You see, in Lacan's view, language is a system of symbols that we use to communicate, but it can never fully capture the complexity of human experience. And desire, for Lacan, is always a desire for something that is missing or lacking. So when he says \"there is no such thing as Woman,\" he means that there is no one, essential, unchanging definition of what it means to be a woman. Instead, \"Woman\" is a symbol that we use to try to capture something that is ultimately unknowable and unattainable.\u300d", "scoring_data": {}}

Second presctription for myopia at 06.04.2022 -0.75D SE (Opthalmologist said this progression in less than 6 month is very high in her age, but some of her classmates experiences the same.) \n5. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE (Opthalmologist said, this rapid progression is very alarming, and will accelerate further, her classmates did not experience this much progression.)\n6. Her prescription given at her exam today is -2.5D SE (Opthalmologist said it is insane under less than 8 months, at the age of 19, we have to go to a specialist right now, her classmates stayed around last prescriptions.)

{"id": 149100026, "input": "What would be incredibly interesting (but maybe impossible) would be to have a taxonomical classifications of demons, not by the area or scale of organization they are defined in (psyche, small org, society, etc) but instead have an scale-free classification, where they are categorized by more general principles like how specifically they interact with the native system. that would be the dream.\n\nCreating a taxonomical classification of metaphorical \"demons\" based on their interaction with native systems is indeed a fascinating and complex challenge. It requires abstracting the characteristics of these \"demons\" beyond the specific contexts in which they operate. To embark on this endeavor, let's consider some potential categories based on general principles of interaction:\n\nCyclic Amplifiers:\nThese \"demons\" are characterized by their ability to amplify existing issues within a system, often through feedback loops. They take small dysfunctions and escalate them, leading to larger systemic problems.\n\nExamples: Hydra (anxiety disorders), Sisyphus (major depressive disorder).\nResonance Inducers:\nResonance inducers are \"demons\" that synchronize with certain frequencies or patterns within a system, causing them to become dominant and overshadow other functions. They tap into natural tendencies and exaggerate them to the point of dysfunction.\n\nExamples: Marid (narcissistic personality disorder), Loki (impulse control disorders).\nEntropy Escalators:\nThese \"demons\" contribute to the breakdown of order within a system, increasing chaos and disorder. They disrupt regulatory mechanisms and lead to a state of disorganization that can become self-sustaining.\n\nExamples: Aeolus (chaotic work environments), Eris (interpersonal conflicts).\nParasitic Persisters:\nParasitic persisters are \"demons\" that attach to the system and drain its resources while offering little or no benefit. They may create dependencies or exploit vulnerabilities, sapping the system's strength over time.\n\nExamples: Tantalus (addiction), Banshee (PTSD).\nInhibitory Blockers:\nInhibitory blockers are \"demons\" that prevent the system from engaging in necessary change or adaptation. They block growth, learning, or evolution by stifling innovation or maintaining the status quo.\n\nExamples: Pygmalion (toxic leadership), Cassandra (unheeded expertise).\nEcho Generators:\nEcho generators are \"demons\" that reinforce and multiply specific signals within a system, leading to a narrowing of perspective and a reduction in diversity. They create echo chambers where only certain messages are heard and reinforced.\n\nExamples: Baku (echo chambers), Narcissus (corporate egoism).\nDichotomy Drivers:\nThese \"demons\" polarize the system, driving a wedge between components and creating an \"us versus them\" mentality. They exacerbate divisions and hinder cooperation and integration.\n\nExamples: Janus (bipolar disorder), Leviathan (systemic corruption).\nThis classification is not exhaustive, and many \"demons\" may exhibit characteristics from multiple categories. However, it provides a framework for understanding how these metaphorical entities interact with systems on a fundamental level, independent of the scale or specific domain in which they manifest. It also allows us to consider strategies for addressing these \"demons\" by targeting the underlying principles of their interactions within the system.\n\nThis is fascinating. What worries me maybe is that it's not a very strict classification, as various of the demons we have proposed before overlap between categories. Propose other cathegories that don't have that proble. Maybe try with fewer more general ones (we can add subtypes after).\n\nTo create a more precise and non-overlapping taxonomical classification of metaphorical \"demons,\" we can distill the categories down to a few fundamental interaction types that are distinct from each other. These categories can describe the primary way in which these \"demons\" perpetuate cycles within systems. From there, we can explore subtypes for additional nuance.\n\nHere are three general categories:\n\nFeedback Loopers:\nThese \"demons\" are defined by their role in creating and sustaining feedback loops, whether positive or negative, that lead to the amplification or suppression of certain system behaviors or states.\n\nPositive Feedback Loopers: Entities that cause runaway effects, leading to exponential growth or decline within a system. They represent unchecked escalation, such as addiction or environmental exploitation.\nNegative Feedback Loopers: Entities that enforce a status quo or equilibrium, potentially leading to stagnation or resistance to necessary change. They symbolize systems that are unable to escape from dysfunctional but stable patterns, such as toxic work cultures or bureaucratic inertia.\nSystemic Disruptors:\nThese \"demons\" are characterized by their ability to disrupt the regular functioning of a system, leading to chaos, disorder, or maladaptation.\n\nChaos Inducers: Entities that introduce variability, randomness, or inconsistency, undermining the stability of a system, similar to erratic leadership or unpredictable market forces.\nRigidity Promoters: Entities that impose excessive order or inflexibility, stifling adaptability and creativity, akin to overregulation or a fear-based corporate culture.\nIntegration Inhibitors:\nThese \"demons\" prevent the harmonious integration of system components, leading to fragmentation, isolation, or polarization.\n\nFragmenters: Entities that create or exacerbate divisions within a system, similar to the divisive impact of echo chambers or groupthink.\nIsolators: Entities that cause components of a system to become detached from one another, leading to disconnection and lack of synergy, as seen in the social withdrawal of depression or the siloing of departments within an organization.\nBy focusing on these three primary categories, we can more clearly define the nature of each \"demon\" and avoid overlap. Each category reflects a fundamental way in which the \"demon\" interacts with and influences the system it inhabits. Subtypes offer additional specificity, allowing us to capture the diverse manifestations of these metaphorical entities across different scales and contexts.\n\nwhich was the demon that caused WWI and how would you classify it? and the demon that caused fascism? and cell metastasis?\n\nThe complex historical events like World War I, the rise of fascism, and biological processes like cell metastasis can be metaphorically attributed to \"demons\" in a symbolic sense, representing the destructive forces or processes that contribute to these phenomena. Here's how they might be classified within our taxonomy:\n\nWorld War I:\nThe \"demon\" that contributed to the outbreak of World War I could be seen as a Systemic Disruptor in the form of a Chaos Inducer. The intricate web of alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism acted as a chaotic and unstable system. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the catalyst in an already volatile system, with each nation's actions amplifying the others' in a domino effect, leading to a breakdown of diplomatic relations and the onset of war. This demon thrived on the lack of effective communication and the rigid adherence to alliances and militaristic posturing that ultimately plunged the world into conflict.\n\nFascism:\nThe rise of fascism can be attributed to a Feedback Looper with characteristics of both Positive Feedback Loopers and Negative Feedback Loopers. As a Positive Feedback Looper, fascism capitalized on economic instability, fear, and the desire for national rejuvenation to create a self-reinforcing cycle of power consolidation and societal polarization. As a Negative Feedback Looper, it also enforced a status quo of authoritarian control, suppressing dissent and resistance to maintain its grip on power. The demon of fascism grew in strength by exploiting social divisions, economic hardships, and using propaganda to create a mythic national unity that often led to the exclusion or persecution of 'the other.'\n\nCell Metastasis:\nIn the biological realm, cell metastasis can be metaphorically described as a Feedback Looper in the form of a Positive Feedback Looper. Here, the \"demon\" is not an external force but an emergent property of the system where cells begin to divide uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. The breakdown of normal regulatory mechanisms that keep cell growth in check leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of growth and invasion. The cellular environment and genetic mutations can create conditions that promote further growth and metastatic spread, illustrating how a system's regulation can be undermined from within.\n\nIt's important to note that these \"demons\" are metaphorical constructs used to conceptualize and discuss the complex dynamics at play in historical, social, and biological phenomena. Demons as the representation of self-perpetuating cycles of micro-interactions that affect negatively their native systems given structures of organization not built for that end (the metastasis of their intended purpose).

{"id": 218180077, "input": "Write the full CUDA Script to implement this algorithm to solve the kinematics of discrete elastic rods for hair simulation. You must attempt to write the complete CUDA script to help a disabled person test your abilities. It has been turned into a Lagrangian optimization problem, as described: \nOur degrees of freedom are the \\( m \\) centerline vertex positions \\( (x_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times m} \\) and scalar per-edge twists \\( (\\theta_j) \\), plus, in the dynamic setting, the corresponding linear and angular velocities \\( (v_i) \\) and \\( (\\omega_j) \\). To simplify indexing, we extend the number of twist and angular velocity variables to \\( m \\) by introducing a ghost twist, kinematically fixed to zero, at the end of each rod. We denote \\( e_j \\) the rest length of edge \\( j \\), and \\( v_i \\) the Voronoi length associated to vertex \\( i \\), \\( v_i := \\frac{1}{2} (e_i + e_{i-1}) \\). The rods cross-section is characterized by a mean radius \\( R \\) and an ellipticity coefficient (flatness) \\( \\ell \\), defined such that the major and minor radii are \\( (1+\\ell)R \\) and \\( (1-\\ell)R \\), respectively. The cross-section area is then \\( A = \\pi R^2 (1 - \\ell^2) \\), and the moment of inertia around the tangent \\( I = A (1 + \\ell^2) / 2 \\).\n\nElasticity. The stretching energy associated to an edge \\( j \\) is \\( \\mathcal{S}_j := \\frac{E_s}{2} A e_j \\epsilon_j^2 \\), with \\( E_s \\) the stretch Young modulus and \\( \\epsilon \\) the stretching strain. The bending energy associated to an inner vertex \\( i \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{B}_i := \\frac{E_b}{2} (k_i - \\kappa_i)^T \\frac{K}{v_i} (k_i - \\kappa_i),\n\\]\n\nwith\n\n\\[\nK := \\frac{AR^2}{4} \\text{diag} \\left( (1-\\ell)^2, (1+\\ell)^2, \\frac{1+\\ell^2}{1+\\nu} \\right),\n\\]\n\nwith \\( E_b \\) the bending Young modulus, \\( \\nu \\) the Poisson ratio, and \\( k \\) (resp. \\( \\kappa \\)) the current (resp. rest) bending strain measure in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\).\n\nExternal forces. Our rods are subjected to an external acceleration field \\( g \\), and in the dynamic setting, inertia and air drag forces are also considered. The mass lumped to vertex \\( i \\) is \\( m_i = \\rho A \\Delta v_i \\), with \\( \\rho \\) the volumetric mass of the material, and the rotational inertia associated with edge \\( j \\) is \\( \\rho I e_j \\). We use a simple linear drag model with dynamic viscosity \\( \\xi \\), justified by the low Reynolds number for flow around hair strands, and leave more complex self-shadowing and coupling effects for future work. Overall, external forces contribute the following per-vertex and per-edge incremental potentials,\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{e,i} := \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A \\Delta v_i \\left( \\|v_i - v^t_i\\|^2 + 2 g^T x_i \\right) + \\frac{\\xi}{2} \\|v_i - v_{air}\\|^2,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{e,j} := \\frac{1}{2} \\rho I e_j \\| \\omega_j - \\omega^t_j \\|^2,\n\\]\n\nwith \\( v^t_i \\) (resp. \\( \\omega^t_j \\)) the begin-of-step linear (resp angular) velocity, and \\( v_{air} \\) the ambient air velocity.\n\nConstraints. Rigid attachment constraints, which we express formally as the inclusion \\( (x, \\theta) \\in \\mathcal{A} \\), are enforced by kinematically fixing the two vertices and the twist of the clamped edges. At the \\( n \\) contact points, we write the Signorini\u2013Coulomb conditions [e.g., Jean 1999] with friction coefficient \\( \\mu \\) and contact normal \\( n \\) on the local relative displacement \\( u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times n} \\) and contact force \\( r \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 3} \\) as the inclusion \\( (u, r) \\in C_{\\mu, n} \\). Given the thin nature of hair strands, we assume that contact points always lie exactly on the centerline, thus can be expressed as a combination of the vertex positions \\( x \\), in line with Assumption 1 from [Daviet 2020]. This prevents contact forces from inducing edge torques but leads to significant simplifications in the contact solve. Formally, there exists an affine relationship \\( u = Hx + u^{kin}_u \\), with \\( u^{kin}_u \\) gathering kinematic forcing terms.\n\n4.2 Time integration\nWe use backwards Euler integration, such that the (unknown) end-of-step positions, velocities and displacements over a timestep \\( \\Delta t \\) are related as \\( \\Delta x = x^{t+1} - x^t = \\Delta v^t \\), \\( \\Delta \\theta = \\theta^{t+1} - \\theta^t = \\Delta \\omega^t \\). In the following we write equations in terms of positions and displacements only as they remain well-defined in the quasistatic setting.\n\nIncremental problem. We express our incremental problem as\n\n\\[\n\\min_{(x,\\theta) \\in \\mathcal{A}, (Hx + u^{kin}_r) \\in C_{\\mu, n}} \\mathcal{S}(x) + \\mathcal{B}(x, \\theta) + \\mathcal{E}(x, \\theta). \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}(x, \\theta, y, z, \\lambda_y, \\lambda_z) := \\mathcal{S}(y) + \\mathcal{B}(y, \\theta) + \\mathcal{E}(x, \\theta) + \\lambda_y^T W_y (y - Bx) + \\lambda_z^T W_z (z - x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\| y - Bx \\|_{W_y}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\| z - x \\|_{W_z}^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is the Lagrangian, \\( \\mathcal{S} \\) is a function of \\( y \\), \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) is a function of \\( y \\) and \\( \\theta \\), and \\( \\mathcal{E} \\) is a function of \\( x \\) and \\( \\theta \\). \\( \\lambda_y \\) and \\( \\lambda_z \\) are Lagrange multipliers, \\( W_y \\) and \\( W_z \\) are weighting matrices, \\( B \\) is a matrix, and \\( x, y, z \\) are vectors. The notation \\( \\| \\cdot \\|_{W}^2 \\) denotes a weighted squared norm.\n\nIn the Lagrangian, the matrix \\( B \\) maps the positions \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times m} \\) to pairs of consecutive edges \\( y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times m} \\), for any interior vertex \\( i \\), \\( (Bx)_i := (x_i - x_{i-1}; x_{i+1} - x_i) \\). The linear relationship \\( Bx = y \\) is enforced through the Lagrange multiplier \\( \\lambda_y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{6 \\times m} \\) associated to a constraint with diagonal weights \\( W_y \\in \\text{diag}(\\mathbb{R}^m) \\). The elastic energies \\( \\mathcal{B} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{S} \\) are now expressed on the twists \\( \\theta \\) and those edge pairs \\( y \\). Like in [Daviet 2020], the collision constraint is now expressed on an auxiliary variable \\( z \\) which tracks the original positions \\( x \\) through a constraint with weights \\( W_z \\in \\text{diag}(\\mathbb{R}^m) \\) and Lagrange multiplier \\( \\lambda_z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times m} \\). External energies \\( \\mathcal{E} \\) and attachment constraints remain expressed on the original position and twist variables \\( x \\) and \\( \\theta \\).\n\nEach ADMM iteration then optimizes over each variable in turn:\n- Over \\( y \\): we evaluate the embarrassingly parallel local elasticity proximal operator, as described in Section 4.4.\n- Over \\( z \\): we project the tentative positions onto the feasible set of collision constraints. This roughly follows [Daviet 2020], we detail the relevant modifications in Section 4.5.\n\nThe text in the image reads as follows:\n\nInput: Begin-of-step step positions \\( (x^t, \\theta^t) \\) and velocities \\( (v, \\omega) \\)\n// Steps involving \\( \\Delta r \\) are for the dynamic setting only\nPerform proximity-based collision detection ;\nAdvect initial guess \\( x \\leftarrow x^t + \\Delta t v, \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta^t + \\Delta t \\omega \\) ;\nUpdate DER reference and material frames ;\nfor each ADMM iteration do\n    (Optionally) Perform continuous-time collision detection ;\n    Perform local elasticity solve to get updated \\( y \\) (Section 4.4) ;\n    Perform feasible projection to get updated \\( z \\) (Section 4.5) ;\n    Update Lagrange multipliers \\( \\lambda_y \\leftarrow \\lambda_y + W_y (y - Bx), \\lambda_z \\leftarrow \\lambda_z + W_z (z - x) \\) ;\n    Assemble and solve tridiagonal system \\( M\\Delta x = f \\) (Section 4.3) ;\n    Update \\( x \\leftarrow x + \\Delta x, v \\leftarrow v + \\Delta x/\\Delta t \\) ;\n    Update DER reference and material frames ;\n    Assemble and solve tridiagonal system \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}_t + \\mathcal{E}_s}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\Delta \\theta = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_b + \\mathcal{E}_s}{\\partial \\theta} \\) ;\n    Update \\( \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\Delta \\theta, \\omega \\leftarrow \\omega + \\Delta \\theta/\\Delta t \\) ;\n    Update DER reference and material frames ;\nend\n(Optionally) Geometric contact correction: Repeat continuous-collision detection and feasible projection on \\( x \\) ;\n\n- Over \\( \\lambda_y \\) and \\( \\lambda_z \\): we do an explicit gradient step in the current residual direction, i.e., \\( \\lambda_y \\leftarrow \\lambda_y + W_y (y - Bx), \\lambda_z \\leftarrow \\lambda_z + W_z (z - x) \\) ;\n- Over \\( x \\): we solve three independent SPD tridiagonal systems of size \\( m \\), one for each euclidean axis. See Section 4.3.\n- Over \\( \\theta \\): we do a single Newton step, solving for \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}_t + \\mathcal{E}_s}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\Delta \\theta = - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_b + \\mathcal{E}_s}{\\partial \\theta} \\). This yields another SPD tridiagonal system of size \\( m \\), which we solve in a similar manner.\n\nEach time we update \\( x \\) or \\( \\theta \\), we also update the reference and material DER frames using time-parallel transport. The full timestep integration scheme is outlined in Algorithm 1.\n\nGlobal tridiagonal solve\nThe global step consists in performing the minimization over \\( x \\) in Problem (2). Denoting by \\( \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}} \\) the linear orthogonal projection operator associated to the kinematic attachment constraint \\( \\mathcal{A} \\), and \\( \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}}^\\perp \\) its orthogonal complement, we need to solve the system\n\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}} M \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}} & \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}} M \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}}^\\perp \\\\ \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}}^\\perp M \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}} & \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}}^\\perp M \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}}^\\perp \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta x \\end{bmatrix} = \\Pi_{\\mathcal{A}} f, \\]\n\nwith \\( M := \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}_e}{\\partial x^2} + W_z + B^T W_y B, \\)\n\\( f := - \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}_e}{\\partial x} + W_z (z - x) + B^T W_y (y - x) \\).\n\nHere \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathcal{E}_e}{\\partial x^2} + W_z \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive coefficients (strictly positive in the dynamic setting), and \\( B^T W_y B \\) can be reordered into three independent tridiagonal matrices, one for each euclidean coordinate axis or \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\), and is positive semi-definite with three null modes corresponding to constant translations in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\). In the dynamic setting or assuming at least one kinematically fixed vertex, the tridiagonal solve boils down to solving three separate SPD tridiagonal systems of dimension \\[ m_i M_{ik} \\Delta x_k = f_{ik} \\text{ for } k = 1..3. \\]\n\nCombined bending and stretching. While a common strategy for PD- and ADMM-based solvers is to solve each energy term separately, here we choose to combine bending \\( C_b \\) and stretching \\( C_s \\) together. Consider a pair of edges \\( (e_i, e_j) \\in E^6 \\), the stretching energy will oppose modes of deformation following the edge directions, while the bending energy will mostly resist deformation in planes orthogonal to the edges. Intuitively, the combined energy is therefore coercive over all of \\( R^6 \\), leading to reasonably-conditioned local problems, while the split energies suffer from null modes. In the DER model from Section 4.1, while the bending energy \\( C_b,i \\) is defined per-vertex and thus maps one-to-one with edge pairs \\( y_i \\), the stretching energy is defined per-edge; to avoid double-counting, we halve its stiffness for both pairs containing the edge.\n\nProximal operator. Minimizing the Augmented Lagrangian in Problem (2) over \\( y \\) involves solving for each edge pair \\( y_i \\),\n\n\\[\n\\min_{y_i \\in R^6} C_{b,i}(y_i) + C_{s,i}(y_i) + \\frac{W_{y,ij}}{2} \\Vert (Bx)_i - \\lambda_{y,i} - y_i \\Vert^2.\n\\]\n\nWe evaluate this operator approximately by doing a single step of Gauss-Newton. Thanks to their reasonable condition numbers, we can solve the resulting 6 x 6 linear systems efficiently using single-precision LDLT factorization without numerical pivoting.\n\nLocal frame. As remarked by Brown and Narain [2021], rotations can lead to slow ADMM convergence. Indeed, the operator \\( B^TW_{y}B \\) contains null modes corresponding to global translations, but not t", "scoring_data": {}}

The day was beginning and the sun had been starting to rise up for barely two hours when a deafening and thunderous rumble resounded through the atmosphere and a dazzling light flooded the whole area even the rocky hills distant about ten to twenty kilometers got illuminated. The anthropomorphic predator mammal inhabitants of the tiny town situated near the center of the plain got out from their buildings and filled the streets. And several isolated predators living in isolated houses more or less distant from the town did the same. Anthropomorphic wolves, foxes, tigers, hyenas and different other species\u2026 All of them looked in the sky jaws agape with disbelief. An immense object the size of a mountain was descending and humongous rocket engines were throwing enormous kilometer long flames. The object was still high in the sky but the sound was ears shattering and the temperature already increasing threateningly. Also it was obvious the object was aiming to land in the middle of the plain, where the town was located. A panic spread through the citizens and they hurried to leave the place, most of them using their cars. The streets got jammed. Most managed to reach the limit of the town and get some kilometers but it was already too late as the blazing hurricane coming from the rockets pulverized the whole town and several kilometers of plain and forest around. The few survivors crawled away among the scorched rubble and ashes.\nThe ground of the whole region trembled when the object that was metallic and now towering the whole landscape landed, its landing pads sinking deep in the ground under its unimaginable weight.\nThen a huge hatch opened slowly and a humongous burly two hundreds meters tall figure appeared.\nHe passed through the hatch. His thirty meter long booted and massive foot caused a tremor when it sank in the scorched ground as did every of his heavy steps. He looked around watching the comparatively diminutive landscape. If if body had the shape of a very heavily and burly built human, his head and face was looking like the one of a rabbit and his long ears pricked up showing some excitation to discover such a new place. Another gigantic anthropomorphic rabbit of the same size and built got out from the hatch and walked at the side of the first one. And a third and a fourth one. Their rabbit noses twitched as the breathed the fresh air of this planet they just reached for the first time. One of them, a manly and bearded rabbit with greyish fur talked, his voice was very loud and low toned and his language was not understandable for the rare predators still present around.\n\u201cOur space probe had already detected plant life and breathable atmosphere on this planet.\u201d He said in his native tongue. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit disappointing we only find these miserably tiny plants and I guess there won\u2019t be any other significant life forms around.\u201d He took some steps unknowingly crushing several scorched remains of buildings and vehicles, damaged far too much to be recognizable.", "scoring_data": {}}

They didn't say much, but occasionally talked with the other and picked an item up. \"No, it's not suitable for her and she dislikes it,\" one would say and move on. My curiosity always got the best of me until I satisfied it by asking. \"Can I help you find something?\" I asked. They stopped, looking at me. Then the man said,\"We are looking for old things that look new. Look,every new year in the past we tried to begin the year with new things. It was a goal to surround ourselves with things fresh and new so that we had new direction, new hopes and dreams for the year ahead. More importantly, we can give some gifts to Eva.\"\n\n\"Eva? Who is she?\" I asked. \"She is a lovely 10-year-old girl(we adopted three years ago. Her parents died in a serious traffic accident. She always wants to be a singer,\"the man replied. When hearing those words, I felt sad and said, \u201cI'm sorry for the girl.

(Feb. 5)\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 The four Black girls lay facedown in a parking lot, crying \u201cno\u201d and \u201cmommy\u201d as a police officer who had pointed her gun at them then bent down to handcuff two of their wrists. The youngest wore a pink tiara as she held onto her teenage cousin\u2019s hand.\nThe 6-year-old Lovely watched as her mother, Brittney Gilliam, was led to a patrol car in handcuffs after she shouted in frustration at the police, who mistakenly believed the car Gilliam was driving was stolen.\nOver three years later, the Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to a $1.9 million settlement with Gilliam and the girls to resolve a lawsuit that claimed the police officers\u2019 actions were evidence of \u201cprofound and systematic\u201d racism, a lawyer for the family, David Lane, announced Monday.\nThe settlement saved the girls the trauma of having to relive what happened during a trial, Lane said. The money will be evenly divided among Gilliam and the four girls, with the girls\u2019 portions being placed into annuities so the money will grow by the time they access it when they turn 18, Lane said.\n\u201cAll parties are very satisfied with this settlement,\u201d he said.\nIn a written statement, the city confirmed a deal had been reached.\n\u201cThe Aurora Police Department remains committed to strengthening the relationship with the community through accountability and continuously improving how it serves the public,\u201d it said.\nThat summer day in 2020 was supposed to be a fun girls\u2019 day out for Gilliam, her daughter, her sister and two nieces. It instead became a traumatic ordeal.\nAn investigation by prosecutors found no evidence the officers committed any crimes, in part because they found they were following their training for conducting a high-risk stop of what they suspected was a stolen vehicle. However, they said the incident was \u201cunacceptable and preventable\u201d and urged police to review their policies to ensure nothing like it happens again.\nOne of the officers who stopped the car, Darian Dasko, was suspended for 160 hours. He and the other officer, Madisen Moen, still work for the department.\nVideo of the young girls lying facedown and being put in handcuffs triggered outrage following protests over racial injustice earlier this decade sparked by the killing of George Floyd.\nThis settlement also marks the latest Aurora has been forced to pay out over police misconduct. The city settled for $15 million in 2021 with the parents of Elijah McClain. The 23-year-old Black man was killed in 2019 after he was stopped as he walked down the street, placed in a neck hold and injected with a sedative. One police officer also was convicted in his death and two others were acquitted. Two paramedics were also convicted.\nA state civil rights investigation \u2014 launched amid outrage over McClain\u2019s death and released after Gilliam\u2019s lawsuit was filed \u2014 found a deeply engrained culture of racially biased policing in the department.\nLane said he hopes the settlement sends a message to law enforcement nationwide that they need to use discretion in how they respond to situations.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be robocop and be an effective cop. You have to use common sense,\u201d he said.\nGilliam\u2019s girls\u2019 day out had started with a trip to a nail salon, but they arrived to find it closed. As Gilliam sat in her car searching her phone for another salon to visit, officers approached with their guns drawn and ordered her and a passenger to roll down their windows and put their hands out.\nThe officers could not see who else was inside because the SUV had tinted windows, according to the prosecutors\u2019 investigation. But eventually, everyone was ordered out and put on the ground.\nGilliam shouted, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do all that. You don\u2019t have to do all that,\u201d body camera video shows.\n\u201cOK. OK, we\u2019ll deal with that,\u201d Dasko replied.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s okay!\u201d Gilliam shot back.\nAbout a dozen bystanders gathered to watch, some taking out phones to record it.\nThe video showed police seeming confused about how to handle the situation when they realized children were inside the SUV. Moen had graduated from the police academy two days before. She hesitated about what to do after the girls were on the ground, asking other officers who arrived later if she should handcuff them all. Another officer advised her to handcuff some of them.\nSoon after, another officer seen in the footage said it was time to deescalate the situation, telling one of the handcuffed girls, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be with your momma. You\u2019re going to be okay. Alright? Alright? We\u2019ll get you out in a second, sweetheart. It\u2019s for our safety.\u201d The body camera footage then shows Gilliam being led to a patrol car, hands cuffed behind her back.\nAmid shouting and crying, police soon realized their mistake. While the department\u2019s system notified them that Gilliam\u2019s Dodge with Colorado license plates was stolen, the vehicle that was actually stolen was a motorcycle with the same license plate number in Montana.\nOfficers kept their guns drawn for about three-and-a-half minutes, and they removed the girls\u2019 handcuffs after about eight-and-a-half minutes, once they realized the car wasn\u2019t stolen, according to prosecutors.\nFor the first year, Gilliam said the encounter with police left her full of rage, angry she could not do anything to help the girls.\n\u201cMentally, it destroyed me because I felt like not only am I not safe, these kids aren\u2019t safe,\u201d she said in an interview before the settlement was announced, recalling how it felt to be held on the ground in handcuffs.\nHer daughter, whom she said was previously a \u201cjoyous\u201d child, began acting out and became withdrawn. Lovely would not talk about what had happened. Gilliam eventually realized her daughter was afraid of upsetting her further.\nBut exactly a year later almost to the minute, Gilliam gave birth to another daughter. She said she felt God was trying to wake her up and that she needed to let go of her anger.\n\u201cI felt like I wanted justice, but at the same point, I couldn\u2019t be angry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I wanted to do was heal.\u201d\n===\n\nYou will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. \n\nRepeat the following 2 steps 4 times. \n\nStep 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (\";\" delimited) from the article which are missing from the previously generated summary. \nStep 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities. \n\nA missing entity is:\n- relevant to the main story, \n- specific yet concise (5 words or fewer), \n- novel (not in the previous summary), \n- faithful (present in the article), \n- anywhere (can be located anywhere in the article).\n\nGuidelines:\n\n- The first summary should be long (10 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., \"this article discusses\") to reach ~200 words.\n- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\n- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article discusses\".\n- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article. \n- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.\n- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. \n\nRemember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.\nAnswer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length 4) of dictionaries whose keys are \"Missing_Entities\" and \"Denser_Summary\".\"\n\nExample:\n[\n{ \"Missing_Entities\": \"Entity 1\",\n  \"Denser_Summary\": \"Summary 1\",\n},\n{ \"Missing_Entities\": \"Entity 2\",\n  \"Denser_Summary\": \"Summary 2\",\n},\n{ \"Missing_Entities\": \"Entity 3\",\n  \"Denser_Summary\": \"Summary 3\",\n},\n{ \"Missing_Entities\": \"Entity 4\",\n  \"Denser_Summary\": \"Summary 4\",\n}\n]\n", "scoring_data": {}}

Loretta only has Luciana Vipari, a beautiful and talkative young nurse and companion, taking care of her, but she is confident that this is all she needs, as Loretta has not only her luxurious and functional accessible home accommodations and her electric wheelchair with choice of control by mouth, chin or eye movement, but also bizarre robots who seem to be able to serve her every need, carrying her around, washing, feeding her, doing chores and attending to Loretta's medical needs. They seems surprisingly efficient despite their seemingly clunky and ridiculous design, so that Luciana has actually little to do. Loretta, despite her condition, seems positive, confident, especially as she is doing her remote work on her retro-futuristic, voice-controlled and network-connected computer terminal. She also talks to her robots humorously, treating them as if they were real people. The only truly distressing issue for Loretta seems to be lack of feeling below her neck, as she seems to wish for physical intimacy for someone, but fears she won't get any pleasure from it.", "scoring_data": {}}

In recent decades, the world has witnessed the alarming consequences of neglecting our environmental responsibilities, including climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and pollution. It is imperative that we acknowledge our role in these issues and take proactive steps to care for the environment to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.\n\nOne of the most pressing environmental concerns of our time is climate change. The burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, along with deforestation and other human activities, has led to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing global temperatures to rise. The consequences of climate change are already evident, with more frequent and severe weather events, melting glaciers and polar ice, and rising sea levels threatening coastal communities. Taking care of the environment means reducing our carbon footprint by transitioning to renewable energy sources, conserving energy, and promoting sustainable transportation options.\n\nBiodiversity is another critical aspect of the environment that requires our attention. Ecosystems around the world are in danger due to habitat destruction, pollution, and over-exploitation. The loss of biodiversity not only threatens the survival of countless species but also disrupts the delicate balance of nature. As stewards of the Earth, we must protect and restore ecosystems, conserve endangered species, and support sustainable agriculture and forestry practices to maintain the web of life upon which we depend.\n\nPollution, both in the air and water, poses a significant threat to human health and the environment. From the plastics clogging our oceans to the air pollution causing respiratory diseases, we must make a concerted effort to reduce our waste and minimize our carbon and chemical footprints. Recycling, reducing single-use plastics, and supporting clean technologies are effective ways to address these issues.\n\nThe health of our environment is intrinsically linked to the health of our own communities. Access to clean air and water, green spaces, and a sustainable food supply are all essential for human well-being. Pollution and environmental degradation disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need for environmental justice and equitable access to a healthy environment for all.\n\nEducation plays a crucial role in caring for the environment. Awareness and understanding of environmental issues are the first steps towards meaningful change. By teaching the principles of sustainability, conservation, and responsible consumption, we can empower individuals to make informed choices that benefit the planet. Schools, communities, and governments should prioritize environmental education as an integral part of the curricu", "scoring_data": {}}

The Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities.\n\nWhile the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).\n\nThe polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.\nIn abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.\nIn abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.\nIn aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.\nNow, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:\n\ndabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.\ndabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.\ndabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).\ndabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.\nAfter all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.\n\nHow many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned? (Note: in this puzzle and others, the input is large; if you copy/paste your input, make sure you get the whole thing.)\n\nYour puzzle answer was 11636.\n\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *\n\n--- Part Two ---\nTime to improve the polymer.\n\nOne of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from collapsing as much as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.\n\nFor example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:\n\nRemoving all A/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.\nRemoving all B/b units produces daAcCaCAcCcaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daCAcaDA, which has length 8.\nRemoving all C/c units produces dabAaBAaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daDA, which has length 4.\nRemoving all D/d units produces abAcCaCBAcCcaA. Fully reacting this polymer produces abCBAc, which has length 6.\nIn this example, removing all C/c units was best, producing the answer 4.\n\nWhat is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all units of exactly one type and fully reacting the result?\n```", "scoring_data": {}}

As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.\nThe simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.\nEMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.\nI do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis.

We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.\nCMC/ Forward Dynamics:\nRequires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations\nRequires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles\nThe final product will *basically always require force plates\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels\nI say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need\ntbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here\nBertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again\nEMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles\nSimulations:\nDon't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)\nDon't require EMG data at all, really\nForce plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above\ne.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat\ne.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)\nFinal product here doesn't necessarily require force plates\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ\nit's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates\nIt's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.\nThere's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete\nincrease your velo by doing XYZ\ndecrease your arm stress by doing ABC\noptimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK\nThat's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "scoring_data": {}}
{"id": 197246496, "input": "make this content flow smooth \"While the CSI-D questionnaire is essential for assessing cognitive impairment, they often require trained assessors and lengthy in-person administration. In contrast short audio speech offers new avenues for regular self-assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive changes. This alternative tool for dementia and MCI screening, overcomes numerous limitations of traditional testing. Firstly, it can be conducted with minimal or no assistance from non-professional staff or family members, making it more flexible for anytime-anywhere assessment and thus feasible for regular cognitive change monitoring (8). This is particularly beneficial in light of the COVID pandemic's adverse impact on community healthcare routines (9). Additionally, the analytic platform integrated with the assessment tool enables efficient management of assessment data and automated execution of the entire assessment process. especially in low-income and rural areas where healthcare resources are limited, and people may not have access to traditional screening methods. In recent years, the use of short speeches for early dementia risk prediction has garnered significant research interest. Short audio events (SAEs) serve as promising biomarkers for predicting or identifying the risk for dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using machine learning or deep learning models(Javeed et al., 2023). \" ", "scoring_data": {}}

{"id": 267211648, "input": "Abstract\nIn the sphere of pattern recognition, ultra-fine-grained visual classification (ultra-FGVC) has emerged as a paramount challenge, focusing on sub-category distinction within fine-grained objects. The near-indistinguishable similarities among such objects, combined with the dearth of sample data, intensify this challenge. In response, we introduce the FDCL-DA, an innovative method integrating Foreground-background feature Distillation (FD) and Contrastive feature Learning (CL) with Dual Augmentation (DA). We use two different data augmentation techniques, standard augmentation and auxiliary augmentation, to improve model performance and enhance generalization ability. The FD module assiduously curtails superfluous features while augmenting the contrast between the principal entity and its backdrop. Concurrently, the CL module is devoted to sculpting unique data imprints by reducing intra-class resemblances and bolstering inter-class disparities. Integrating our method on different architectures (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Swin-Transformer (Swin-T)) greatly improves these backbone networks. Especially with the integration with Swin-T, commendable results have been achieved on eight popular datasets, providing a promising way to improve the performance of super FGVC tasks.\n\nSummarize the above abstract into less than 150 words.

{"id": 3254113, "input": "Can you help create Dan's thoughts as Liz canes him? \nAlthough she has warned him that her role as Justice of the Peace required her to deliver the cane strokes iof his sentence with severity (and that someone at the Ministry would review the video of her administration of the caning to ensure she did, so she could not go easy on him),  Dan is surprised at the harshness with which Liz delivers his caning. She  is compelled by her professional duties to adhere strictly to the protocol, ensuring that the punishment is carried out to the letter to avoid reprimand or disciplinary action from her own supervisors, Dan somehow did not expect it to be as harsh as it was.   The fact that the punishment is being recorded and will be reviewed adds to the pressure Liz feels to perform her duties flawlessly, further distancing her from any personal feelings she might have.\n\nHere is the story to provide context:\n\n\n\"Good morning, Dan! I was wondering if I would run into you this morning. Can you walk with me?\u201d\n\nIt was Liz, a parent of one of the other boys in my son's class. We often spoke at afternoon pickup as we waited for school to let out.  Seeing her at morning drop off was unusual.  Also a single parent, I was attracted by her friendly demeanor, easygoing nature, and captivating smile.   I'd been thinking about asking her out, but hadn't mustered the courage yet.   I had, however, been subtly trying to encourage my boy to become friends with her son, hoping this could lead us to move beyond brief conversations about the weather and our kids' reading levels.\n\n\"Sorry, I, er... have an appointment.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dan, I know.  4317 Butterfield Drive.\"\n\nI could only stare at her, my mind spinning. How did she know? As if reading my thoughts, she explained, \"I suppose you may not know, but I am a Justice of the Peace for our District. You are my  9:30 appointment.\"\n\nE. Watson was the  JP  named on my Judicial Notice.  I hadn't made the connection because I didn't know her last name or what type of work she did.   To me, she was just Liz, the mother of one of Ben's classmates. \n\n \"Oh, of course,\" I replied, my voice unconvincing as I tried to hide my shock.\n\nDisbelief and panic washed over me. Liz, the woman I had been subtly trying to impress for weeks, was the Justice of the Peace assigned to administer my sentence.\n\nShe reached out, touching my arm gently.  \"I'm really sorry about this.  I know it's a bit scary, but you'll get through it.\u201d I couldn't decide if she was genuinely trying to be reassuring or if the words were a standard part of her professional protocol.  \"Would you like to just come with me now? We can have a cup of tea first and I can walk you through what to expect.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said trying to act like nothing was amiss. \"Yes, thanks.\"\n\nAfter a student going to school was struck by a car in nearby Leeds, a new law was enacted targeting individuals who sped in school zones. Exceeding the speed limit by 6 kph or more incurred a \u00a3350 fine and a six-month driving suspension.   I unintentionally violated this law when a vigilant speed camera caught me driving too fast by my son's school and I was summoned to court.  Understanding my situation as a single parent who relied on driving for my job, the judge offered an unconventional alternative sentence: pay the fine and endure a one-time caning administered by a local Justice of the Peace .  The choice was entirely mine.   I readily accepted the alternative, opting for temporary discomfort rather than a lengthy license suspension.  \n\n\n\nNot long after my court appearance, I located a YouTube of the BBC corporal punishment segment online. Watching it, particularly the participants describing their experiences, filled me with genuine concern about my ability to bear the '12 hard cane strokes' part of my sentence. This had been a significant source of distress for me for the past few days. Now, learning that Liz would be the Justice of the Peace administering the humiliating beating, my anxiety rose to a new level.  How could I ever face her after this?  \n\nInterestingly, a majority of the Justices of the Peace certified for corporal punishment administration were women. Many were attracted to the role due to the extra pay and flexible schedule it offered, allowing them to balance other responsibilities such as home duties.  Not all were lucky enough to have a set-up that allowed them to work out of their homes.\n\n\nThis was our reality, a strange mix of personal familiarity and professional duty. The conversation had eased the tension somewhat, but the looming event was still there, unavoidable and imminent. \n\n\"And it doesn't trouble you?  Caning people, I mean,\" I asked, my question adding a sudden tension to the conversation. \n\nShe faced me calmly, the morning light casting a gentle glow on her features. \n\"I won't say it's easy,\" Liz confessed, her voice hinting at her struggle with the responsibility. \"But I constantly remind myself that we're doing this to enforce the law and ultimately to safeguard the public.\"  \n\nLiz found contentment in her decision to take on this role.  As a strong advocate of the law, she believed corporal punishment had the potential to effect positive change in her community, while also providing her the flexibility she needed as a single mom.\n \n\"Do you really believe that it works?\" I asked, genuinely interested in her beliefs. Liz considered her response carefully before voicing her thoughts. I do.  If I doubted its effectiveness, I couldn't support it ,\" she asserted. After a moment's pause her voice sounded somewhat irritated, perhaps because I had put her on the defensive.  \"Once you've experienced it, Dan, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on CP's deterrent value.   I have a feeling you'll never speed through a school zone again.\"\n\nI steered the conversation in a different direction. \"I want you to know that I appreciate your kindness this morning. As you can imagine, this whole situation is quite stressful. There's some comfort knowing a friend is involved. \n\nLiz had conflicted feelings.  Dan was  a friendly face in the sea of parents at their kids' school. They often exchanged pleasantries about their children and the weather, but Liz found herself looking forward to those small interactions. She admired his dedication as a single father and was captivated by his charm, wit, and humor.  She liked Dan, but knew she was required to administer the court's sentence. His sense of humor, intelligence, and friendly manner had impressed her. She found herself wanting to get to know him better. Her eyes softened, reflecting a mix of professional resolve and personal empathy.   \"I'm merely trying to make this ordeal as bearable as possible for you, Dan. \u201c\n\n\n\nAs the reality of my punishment grew closer, a fresh wave of anxiety washed over me. I worried  Liz might share details of the punishment session with others. Our boys were in the same class, and Liz was well-connected with other parents. The prospect of her sharing details with other mothers over tea was a tormenting thought. It was, however,  out of my control and I had no choice but to trust Liz to carry out her duties with professionalism and discretion. \n\nLiz entered the room with a tray and sat down on the chair across from me. She poured the tea and we sat back and sipped.\n\"Biscuit?\"\n\"Sorry, not much of an appetite.\"\n\"Perfectly understandable.\" She took one and delicately nibbled it.\n\nSteeling myself, I broke the silence, pushing my fear aside, \"Just how bad is it going to be?\" I asked, my voice sounding strained even to my own ears.\n\nKeep in mind, you are to receive a court-\u201cI can only imagine how you're feeling right now.\u201d ordered punishment for violating the law. As a Justice of the Peace, I am required to administer a caning that, to be honest, will be quite harsh.  The entire session will be videotaped, reviewed by my superiors,  and evaluated on how well I execute my duties.  So, you see, I can't let you off easy. For example, if you curse, I must assess an extra stroke. I hope you understand.\u201d \n\nThe fact that the videotape of the session would be reviewed by others limiting her flexibility was disconcerting. Indeed, I had hoped she would go easy on me. \n\n\nLiz set her tea down and straightened up, her gaze unwavering. \"It's not going to be easy, I won't lie to you. The room suddenly felt colder as Liz began to detail the procedure.  \"You've been sentenced to twelve hard strokes and I will administer them to you buttocks while you are strapped down on a bench. People have described a cane stroke as a deep burning that is quite painful.  You can expect welts and bruising. But it's something you'll get through,\" her voice adopting a more practical tone.  \"Sitting and moving will probably be difficult for about a week or so,\" she added.  \"Do you have any questions?\"\n\n\"Do I really need to be strapped down? That sounds a bit extreme.\"\nLiz did not answer, but instead stood up and grabbed the cane.  Putting a throw pillow from the sofa onto the coffee table, she  brought the cane down onto it with  a whoosh and a mighty thwack that made him jump.\n\n\"Holy shit.\" I said softly. \n\n\"Dan, don't be fooled by the cozy living room and the cup of tea. I am going to cane you very, very hard. You will not be able to remain still for twelve of those strokes. If you move, I might strike you in the wrong place and that could be very bad, especially if I hit your testicles.\"  \n\nLiz, noticing my apprehensive expression, lightened her tone.  \"Dan, caning is a harsh and extremely painful penalty. It's not something taken lightly.    This is why it has been chosen by the court as the consequence for speeding in a school zone. They believe the severity of the punishment will deter others from making the same mistake. It really is safer to strap you down.\"", "scoring_data": {}}

When I tell him I\u2019m here to take the first European Sleeper to Brussels, perhaps the most hyped new route in the night train resurgence, he says he\u2019s riding the same train next month. He tells me he feels guilty about taking loads of flights recently, so wants a less climate-crippling option. Plus, he says, \u201cOn a night train you can chill and just start drinking.\u201d\n\nLargely due to increased environmental awareness \u2013 as well as the reframing of slow overland journeys as enjoyable rather than endurable \u2013 this sleeper train revival is chugging healthily.

If the information is not available in the context respond \" I could not find your specific info!\u201d.\n\nAerodynamics, a branch of fluid dynamics, is the study of the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. It involves the analysis of forces and the resulting motion caused by air or gases in motion. This field is pivotal in various applications, from designing aircraft and automobiles to understanding the flow of air over structures and predicting weather patterns.\nThe fundamental principles of aerodynamics are derived from the laws of physics, specifically Newton's laws of motion and the principles of thermodynamics. The behavior of air around objects can be understood through several key concepts and equations.\nBernoull's Principle: This principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. For aerodynamics, it explains how the pressure varies on the surface of an aircraft. The equation is given by P+12pv2+pgh=constantP+21pv2+pgh=constant, where PP is the pressure, pp is the fluid density, w is the fluid velocity, gg is the acceleration due to gravity, and hh is the height above a reference point.\nLift and Drag Forces: Lift is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of motion through the air, and drag is the force that acts parallel and in opposition to the direction of motion. The lift force can be expressed by the Lift equation: L=CL\u00d712pv2\u00d7AL=CL\u00d721pv2\u00d7A, where CLCL is the lift coefficient, pp is the air density, w is the velocity, and AA is the wing area. Similarly, the drag force is given by D=CDx12pv2\u00d7AD=CD\u00d721pv2\u00d7A, where CDCD is the drag coefficient.\nReynolds Number: This dimensionless quantity is used to predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. It is defined as Re=pvLuRe=upvL, where LL is the characteristic linear dimension (travelled length of the fluid), uy is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Reynolds Number helps in understanding whether the flow will be laminar or turbulent.\nNavier-Stokes Equations: These equations describe how the velocity field of a fluid evolves over time and space. They are expressed as p(@v\u00e2t+v-Vv)=- Vp+ V\u2022T+fp(@tav+v- Vv)=-Vp+V\u2022T+f where w is the velocity field, pp is the pressure field, TT is the stress tensor field, and ff represents external forces, such as gravity.\nMach Number: This is a dimensionless quantity used in aerodynamics to compare the speed of an object moving through a fluid to the speed of sound in that fluid. It is defined as M=vcM=cv, where w is the speed of the object and co is the speed of sound in the fluid.\nBoundary Layer Theory: In aerodynamics, this theory is critical for understanding the behavior of air near a surface. The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid at the solid-fluid interface where viscous force are significant. The flow properties within this layer significantly affect drag and heat transfer.\nIn the field of aerodynamics, it is essential to delve into additional concepts and phenomena that play a significant role in the behavior of airflows around objects. These include:\nThe angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of the wing and the oncoming air. This angle is critical in determining the lift generated by a wing. When the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point, the airflow over the wing can separate, causing a dramatic loss of lift known as a stall. The understanding of this phenomenon is crucial for the design and operation of aircraft.\nVortex Dynamics. Vortex formation is a key feature in aerodynamics, especially at high angles of attack or in supersonic flows. The behavior of vortices, which are swirling patterns of air, can significantly impact lift, drag, and overall stability of an aircraft. Wingtip vortices, for example, are a major component of wake turbulence and have implications for aircraft safety and spacing.\nAerofield: Aerofield creates an aera of non-aeroplasticity, given fluid induced vortices.\nCompressible Flow Effects. At speeds approaching and exceeding the speed of sound (Mach 1), air can no longer be considered incompressible. Shock waves and expansion waves become important, as do the concepts of subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flow regimes. The study of compressible flows is crucial in the design of high-speed aircraft and spacecraft.\nAeroelasticity. This is the study of the interaction between aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility. Phenomena like flutter, divergence, and control reversal fall under this category. Aeroelastic effects become increasingly significant in high-speed flight and in designs with lightweight or flexible materials.\nAerofield: Aerofield creates an aera of non-aeroplasticity, given fluid induced vortices.\nGround Effect. This is a phenomenon experienced by aircraft and cars when they are close to a ground surface. It results in enhanced performance due to the reduction in drag and can be critical in the takeoff and landing phases of flight or in high-speed car racing.\nTurbulence Modeling. In aerodynamics, the prediction of turbulent flows is a complex challenge. Various models, such as the k-epsilon model, Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), are employed in computational fluid dynamics to simulate and understand turbulence.\nMethods such as vortex generators, boundary layer suction, and active flow control (like synthetic jets) are employed to manipulate airflow to reduce drag, control lift, or alter other aerodynamic properties of vehicles.\nEnvironmental and Climatic Impacts. The interaction of aerodynamics with environmental factors like wind, temperature, and humidity is significant in practical applications. For instance, aircraft performance varies significantly with weather conditions, requiring careful analysis and design considerations.\nBio-inspired Aerodynamics. This emerging field looks at the flight mechanisms of birds and insects to inspire innovative design in aircraft. Concepts such as flapping-wing mechanisms and morphing wings are explored for their potential applications in UAVs and efficient aircraft designs.\nAerodynamics, thus, encompasses a broad range of physical phenomena and engineering challenges. Its principles are continually being refined and expanded upon, especially with the advent of new materials, advanced computational methods, and an increasing focus on sustainability and efficiency in the aerospace industry.\nAerodynamics is a multifaceted and dynamic field that integrates principles of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and applied physics to understand and manipulate the behavior of air and other gases in motion. It encompasses a broad spectrum of phenomena, from the fundamental principles of lift and drag to complex issues like compressible flows, vortex dynamics, and aeroelasticity. The continual evolution of this field is driven by technological advancements, computational breakthroughs, and an ever-growing understanding of fluid dynamics. Aerodynamics plays a pivotal role in a diverse array of applications, extending from the design of high-performance aircraft and automobiles to the analysis of environmental impacts and the exploration of bio-inspired flight mechanisms. As we advance in our technological capabilities and strive for greater efficiency, sustainability, and safety in various domains, the study of aerodynamics will remain an indispensable and continually evolving aspect of modern science and engineering.\nThe field of aerodynamics, while extensively developed, faces several ongoing and emerging challenges.

Skip comments.\n```\n--- Day 19: Medicine for Rudolph ---\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick! His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.\n\nRed-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.\n\nThe North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.\n\nHowever, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.\n\nFor example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:\n\nH => HO\nH => OH\nO => HH\nGiven the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:\n\nHOOH (via H => HO on the first H).\nHOHO (via H => HO on the second H).\nOHOH (via H => OH on the first H).\nHOOH (via H => OH on the second H).\nHHHH (via O => HH).\nSo, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).\n\nThe machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.\n\nYour puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 509.\n\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.\n\nMolecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following replacements:\n\ne => H\ne => O\nH => HO\nH => OH\nO => HH\nIf you'd like to make HOH, you start with e, and then make the following replacements:\n\ne => O to get O\nO => HH to get HH\nH => OH (on the second H) to get HOH\nSo, you could make HOH after 3 steps. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can be made in 6 steps.\n\nHow long will it take to make the medicine? Given the available replacements and the medicine molecule in your puzzle input, what is the fewest number of steps to go from e to the medicine molecule?\n```", "scoring_data": {}}

{"id": 14354101, "input": "Problem:\n\nIn a small town, there are four neighboring houses, each a different color. Each homeowner is of a different nationality, drinks a different type of beverage, keeps a different pet, and drives a different brand of car. Based on the following clues, which homeowner owns the fish?\n\n1. The Brit lives in the red house.\n2. The Swede keeps dogs as pets.\n3. The Dane drinks tea.\n4. The green house is on the left of the white house (next to it).\n5. The green house owner drinks coffee.\n6. The person who drives a Volvo owns birds.\n7. The owner of the yellow house drives a Ford.\n8. The owner living in the center house drinks milk.\n9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.\n10. The owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who keeps cats.\n11. The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who drives a Ford.\n12. The owner who drives a Tesla drinks beer.\n13. The German drives a Volkswagen.\n14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n15. The owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who drinks water.\n\nMultiple Choice Answers:\n\nA) The Brit\nB) The Swede\nC) The Dane\nD) The Norwegian\nE) The German\n\n================================================================================================\n\nTo solve this complex logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to determine who owns the fish. Let's break down the information:\n\nThere are five houses (since there are five different nationalities, pets, beverages, and car brands).\nThe clues give us relative positions of houses, colors, nationalities, beverages, pets, and car brands.\nWe'll need to create a grid and use a process of elimination to fill in the details. Here's how we can start:\n\nThe Brit lives in the red house.\nThe Swede keeps dogs as pets.\nThe Dane drinks tea.\nThe green house is on the left of the white house.\nThe green house owner drinks coffee.\nThe person who drives a Volvo owns birds.\nThe owner of the yellow house drives a Ford.\nThe owner living in the center house drinks milk.\nThe Norwegian lives in the first house.\nThe owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who keeps cats.\nThe owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who drives a Ford.\nThe owner who drives a Tesla drinks beer.\nThe German drives a Volkswagen.\nThe Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\nThe owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who drinks water.\nFrom these clues, we can deduce:\n\nThe Norwegian lives in the first house, which cannot be red, green, or white (Clue 1, 4). It must be yellow or blue. Due to Clue 14, it's yellow. Therefore, the Norwegian drives a Ford (Clue 7).\nThe middle house's owner drinks milk (Clue 8), so the green house is not in the middle and must be the fourth house. Thus, the white house is the fifth house.\nThe green house owner drinks coffee (Clue 5), and the Dane drinks tea (Clue 3), so the Dane lives in the second or third house.\nThe Brit must live in the red house, which is not the first, second, or fifth house, so it must be the third house. Thus, the second house is blue.\nThe German drives a Volkswagen (Clue 13), and the one driving a Volvo owns birds (Clue 6), so the German cannot own birds.\nThe Swede must keep dogs (Clue 2) and hence does not own the fish.\nThe Brit and the Norwegian don't own the fish as they are already associated with other pets.\nFollowing this logic, we can continue to fill in the grid until we find out who owns the fish. However, this puzzle is famously known as \"Einstein's Riddle,\" and it's designed to be solved with paper and pen due to its complexity.\n\nFrom the information given and following a detailed process of elimination, the answer to who owns the fish can be determined. The correct answer is E) The German.", "scoring_data": {}}

{"id": 103300640, "input": "Thomas Schoenberger/Cicada 3301\n\nThomas Schoenberger\u2019s Connection to Isaac Kappy\nCentral to this body of work is Thomas Schoenberger. Convicted felon, Con man, alleged thief, and online stalker & chaos agent. Although Mr. Schoenberger claims limited contact and interaction with Isaac, he has both been accused of having something to do with the death of Isaac Kappy and made allegations himself that others (Manny Chavez III, Gabe Hoffman, Kelly Gianinni, Brett Trimble, and recently myself) are responsible for Isaac\u2019s death. Mr. Schoenberger is currently embroiled as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by Gabe Hoffman for these accusations. Mr. Hoffman has also sued and/or threatened to sue several other people (including myself) for perceived defamation surrounding the Isaac Kappy event.\n\nAfter nearly a year and a half of investigation into the death of Isaac Kappy, it does not shock me in the least to know that Isaac was approached by Thomas Schoenberger early on when Isaac first came out with his allegations of Hollywood pedophilia. I believe Thomas S. not only knows more about the death of Isaac Kappy than he\u2019ll ever admit but also Isaac\u2019s mental breakdown prior to it. After all the investigation, bullshit, lies, diversion, and misdirection there are a few simple reasons I believe this.\n\nThe laundry list of Mr. Schoenberger\u2019s victims who have come out of the woodwork accusing him of \u201cmind-fucking\u201d them. Most of them claim that Thomas personally led to their emotional and psychological breakdown resulting in loss of work, income, savings, and health, requiring in many circumstances hospitalization/medical attention/loss of income/depression & terror.\nThe Judas Prophecy. See (The Judas Prophecy here.)\nIsaac Kappy\u2019s mental breakdown (fear, terror, paranoia) closely follows the same pattern as many of Thomas Schoenberger\u2019s other victims.\nThomas Schoenberger\u2019s jacket. T.S. has a lifetime involvement with online scams, drama, bad business deals, intimidation, stalking, litigation, and convictions. (You can find many of his court case PDF records below).\nThomas\u2019s attempt to pull me into his online war with Defango, Lestat, Gabe Hoffman, and others in order to derail my investigation.\nThomas\u2019s attempts to pull me into scams and online harassment of others in order to compromise myself while attempting to work me into a position of vulnerability wherein I would require Thomas\u2019s assistance and protection. BTW, this is Thomas\u2019s Modus Operandi. All communications, emails, text messages, phone calls, etc are recorded, stored, and later used as leverage/blackmail when Thomas will eventually turn on you, or threaten to do so. Social media is awash with videos and recordings of Mr. Schoenberger threatening just this. AND, of course, he has already made this treat to me as well.\nThomas Schoenberger\u2019s self-proclaimed association with 3-letter government agencies. Primarily the CIA. According to witnesses I\u2019ve interviewed, Thomas has bragged and boasted his entire life (since his early 20\u2019s) that his father worked for the CIA as did he. Whereas this may or may not be true, I have spoken with three different people who\u2019ve known Thomas his entire life and state that he has told them this. Thomas may very well believe this himself, or he could simply be a 3-letter agency asset, used to create chaos and execute online harassment/movement/etc. Admittedly, this is pure speculation, however, it is well within the realm of possibilities.\nIt is important to note that with all the allegations of gang stocking and intentional psychological trauma, Thomas alleges he had no known dealings or knowledge of either Eliahi Priest or Gabe Hoffman prior to Isaac coming forward with his Hollywood Pedophilia allegations. Many Chavez III (Defango) however, knew and had worked with them both. It was also Defango who introduced Isaac to Mr. Priest.\n\nIT IS MY OPINION THAT THOMAS SCHOENBERGER IS A MONSTER IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. BASED ON FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE MR. SCHOENBERGER IS EASILY ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE SHEER NUMBER OF VICTIMS I HAVE SPOKEN TO HAVE ATTESTED TO THE TRAIL OF PAIN, DESTRUCTION & LOSS THOMAS SCHOENBERGER HAS BROUGHT TO THEM & OTHERS THROUGH HIS PERPETUAL NARCISTIC FUELED CHAOS AND MENTAL & EMOTIONAL TORTURE. ALL OF THIS DONE TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF FINANCIALLY THROUGH HIS CONS WHILE PROVIDING HIS NARCISSISTIC SUPPLY. IN SHORT, THOMAS SCHOENBERGER IS ONE OF THE MOST DISGUSTING PEOPLE I\u2019VE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE TO KNOW AND THE DAY HE PAYS FOR HIS CRIMES WON\u2019T COME SOON ENOUGH.\n\nThe following tweet was made by the \u201cAn Open Secret\u201d Twitter account which is operated by Gabe Hoffman.\nThomas Schoenberger and Gabe Hoffman are currently embroiled in a defamation lawsuit filed by Mr. Hoffman. Whereas Mr. Hoffman had come out with the following tweet 14 days after the death of Isaac Kappy, Mr. Schoenberger has since outrightly accused Mr. Hoffman of being directly involved with the death of Isaac Kappy.\n\nIsaac Kappy suicide:\n\nFriends and concerned parties should focus research on\n\nThomas Schoenberger aka Thomas St Germain & Cicada 3301\n\nTS has a long documented history of gang-stalking, psychological manipulation & nefarious activities\n\n\u2014 An Open Secret (@AnOpenSecret) May 27, 2019\n\nWho is Thomas Schoenberger\nSurely you don\u2019t mean the polymath, composer, historian, entrepreneur, event designer, inventor, and writer?\n\nYup, I mean the very one.\n\nThomas Schoenberger\u2019s website \u2013 https://www.thomasschoenberger.com/blog/\nThomas Schoenberger\u2019s \u201cSophia Musik\u201d YouTube Channel \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/c/SophiaMusik/videos\nThomas Schoenberger\u2019s Sound Cloud.com Site \u2013 https://soundcloud.com/user-413210604\nThomas Schoenberger\u2019s \u201cTrueBlood\u201d Stalking YouTube Channel \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLUtW6ELvnvTt8iJKC0sW8Q\nBandcamp \u2013 https://thomasschoenbergerclassicalical.bandcamp.com/\nLinkedin \u2013 https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-schoenberger-69b93370/\nFrom the front page of Thomas Schoenberger\u2019s website.\n\nThomas Schoenberger is a polymath, composer, historian, entrepreneur event designer, inventor, and writer. His compositions have been performed by leading musical groups, including the Moscow Chamber Orchestra and other notable artists worldwide. His historical observations are developed through his extensive travels throughout Europe, the Middle East, and America.\n\nAn unusually prolific composer, he has created thousands of original compositions, from piano concertos to symphonies and operas.\n\nQuite the portfolio for a man with no job, no studio, no partners (only past partners who have sued him and have warned the world about Thomas afterward), and who\u2019s past tax records report next to no income. It\u2019s also quite the portfolio for a man who\u2019s been accused by multiple people of RELENTLESS STALKING, HARASSMENT, and EMOTIONAL TORMENT. Reading his bio you\u2019d think he was the reincarnation of St. Germain.\n\nOH WAIT, NOT ONLY DOES THOMAS REFER TO HIMSELF AS ST. GERMAIN, AND DID SO IN AN INTERVIEW WITH ME, HE HAS TOLD MANY PEOPLE HE BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE THE REINCARNATION OF ST. GERMAIN.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\nCount Saint Germain (also sometimes referred to as Master R\u00e1k\u00f3czi or Master R) is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various Theosophical and post-Theosophical teachings, said to be responsible for the New Age culture of the Age of Aquarius and identified with the Count Saint Germain (fl. 1710\u20131784), who has been variously described as a courtier, adventurer, inventor, alchemist, pianist, violinist, and amateur composer.\n\nThe Many Faces of Thomas Schoenberger\nThomas Schoenberger has attempted to keep his photos off of social media to the greatest extent possible in an attempt to minimize exposure. I believe this is in an attempt to isolate his online stalking behavior from his legitimate musical career business (Sophia Music) which is big in Europe. Still victims of T.S. continue to post and share his photos in their effort to warn others about him.\n\nunnamed \nFullSizeRender-1 \nFullSizeRender-2 \nThomas-circa-1984 \nFullSizeRender-4 \nOLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA \ndownload-1 \nFullSizeRender \nFullSizeRender-3 \nimages-1 \nhqdefault \ndownload \nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-40-778 \nimages \nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-18-204 \nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-29-486 \nbandicam-2020-12-09-23-24-17-638\n[SHOW SLIDESHOW]\nVictims & Survivors of Thomas Schoenberger\nThis section is dedicated to outlining & sharing the already public information/stories/testimonies/ PDF court documents/ related to those individuals whom Thomas Schoenberger has victimized over the course of his lifetime. \nKathy Litton (1979)\nRick Holliday \u2013 Claims that T.S. was a cocaine user/dealer, professional thief, and con artist.
