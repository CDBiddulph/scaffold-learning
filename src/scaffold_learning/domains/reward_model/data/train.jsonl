Yet, we do not know if such a phenomenon as \u201csprawl\u201d did exist before 1989. The main aim of this\npaper is to assess urban expansion in the metropolitan region of Budapest during state-socialism and after the\npolitical changes, and measure the intensity of urban sprawl. The main thesis is that urban sprawl did not start\nwith the advent of market forces in 1989\u201390, but it was already present during state-socialism, however the\ntempo of sprawl was considerably increased by suburbanization, the dominant form of urban expansion, after\n1990.

Positioned as an event venue with a scenic view of the lake and city skyline, it is conveniently located just 5 minutes from downtown Toronto. Transforming Toronto's hospitality scene, Cabana can accommodate 850 patrons and holds a licensed capacity of 2,500, offering adaptability for events ranging from intimate gatherings of 50 to grand occasions with up to 2,500 attendees.\n\nThe venue offers a range of amenities, including a sprawling 50,000 square foot octagonal pool, a restaurant, a 790-seat patio, and lavish cabanas. Additional offerings encompass shisha stations, bottle service, a retail store, and multiple bars. Operating exclusively on weekends, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., with the option for corporate rentals available from Monday to Friday, Cabana Pool Bar caters to diverse preferences.\n\nDuring the summer months, Cabana operates solely from June to early September each year.

Bellow are listed the aim of the group, and the 2 most important ongoing projects that match with your timetable studies, also, at the bottom are listed your top skills.\n\nAim of the group: Develop functional and stimuli-responsive materials based on polymers and liquid crystals, focusing on light-controllable systems for soft robotics, photonics, and biomaterials science.\n\nProject 1: ERC PoC - Light-driven surface shaping for holographic optical elements [Holoshape]\nNote: The project will start soon, so it would be awesome to be part entirely of it.\nDescription: Diffractive optical waveguides are a key technology for AR & VR displays, offering better field-of-view, smaller size, and wider eye movement range. Traditionally, they are made using expensive and complex processes. However, we have developed a new method using light-induced surface structuring of azobenzene-containing films. This method allows for the creation of complex patterns that are difficult to achieve with conventional tools. We have also developed a digital holographic microscope for real-time monitoring and control of the surface relief grating formation. With this approach, we can precisely control the pattern's pitch, direction, and position, allowing for the creation of arbitrary patterns with multiple exposures.\n\nProject 2: ERC Consolidator - Multimodal Sensory-Motorized Material Systems [MULTIMODAL]\nNote: This project starts this year and it would perfectly suit your studies until your master degree\nDescription: MULTIMODAL will develop sensory-motorized material systems that perceive several coupled environmental stimuli and respond to a combination of these via controlled motor functions, shape-change or locomotion. The sensory-motorized materials will be \u201ctrained\u201d to strengthen upon repetitive action, they can \u201cheal\u201d upon injury, and mechanically adapt to different environments. They will be utilized in the design of soft robots with autonomous and interactive functions.\n\nMy skills: Experience with scientific writing, working with pipelines, paper structures, python (with data science libraries such as skitlearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc), matlab, spreadsheets, excel, sql, machine learning and regression analysis, AI, basic knowledge of the topic of the group, and aim to learn from others.

Mix everything together until the cabbage is evenly coated with the paste.\nPack the kimchi mixture into a jar or container, pressing down firmly to eliminate any air pockets. Leave about an inch of space at the top of the jar.\nCover the jar with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days.

Language, Meaning, and Existentialism\nChapter 4: The Interaction of Modernism and Postmodernism in the \"Molloy\" Novel\n4.1.1. Language Games and Innovative Techniques: The \"Molloy\" novel begins with language games and innovative techniques specific to the modernist era. Beckett pushes the boundaries of language and departs from traditional narrative forms. This modernist approach shapes the complexity and experimental structure of the novel.\n4.1.2. Subjective Narration: In line with modernism, the \"Molloy\" novel adopts subjective narration. The inner monologues and thoughts of the main characters provide readers with an in-depth look into their inner worlds. This reflects the tendency of modernist literature to emphasize individual experience.\n4.1.3. Absurdity and Uncertainty: One of the modernist aspects of the novel is its emphasis on themes of absurdity and uncertainty. The lives and actions of the characters are often meaningless and complex, reflecting the existential crises of the modernist era.\n4.2.1. Fragmented Structure and Various Narrative Techniques: Transitioning to a postmodernist perspective, the \"Molloy\" novel employs a fragmented structure. Different narrators tell stories set in different places and times. This serves as an example of postmodern narrative techniques.\n4.2.2. Fluidity of Reality: Postmodernism proposes a fluidity of reality, and the \"Molloy\" novel also underscores that reality is not fixed and is personal. This is a fundamental principle of postmodernism.\n4.2.3. Subjectivity and Absurdity: One of the postmodernist aspects of the novel is its continuation of the themes of subjectivity and absurdity. The relationships characters have with reality are part of the postmodern understanding.\n4.2.4.

{"id": 116274384, "input": "I write this post but it lacks the first paragrph which uses to make this post catch readers at the first time: Understand Low Resolution and High-Resolution Images\nLow Resolution vs High-Resolution Images\nIn the world of digital imagery, resolution is essentially the sum of all the pixels that make up an image, which you calculate by multiplying the width by the height in pixels.\n\nTake an image with dimensions of 640 by 480 pixels as an example. This means there are 640 pixels across the width and 480 pixels along the height, totaling 307,200 pixels. On the other hand, an image with dimensions of 3840 by 2160 pixels boasts a much higher pixel count of 8,294,400.\n\nThe number of pixels is crucial because it determines an image's detail level. With a higher resolution, you can expect to see more intricate details, making such images ideal for high-quality prints, stunning desktop wallpapers, and sophisticated fine art reproductions. Moreover, high-resolution images are a perfect match for high-definition screens, which is something you may already noticed. For instance, 4K photos from DSLRs are sharp on 4K screens, but 480P images appear fuzzy and pixelated on the same monitor. While low-res images are adequate on smartphones, the pixelation becomes pronounced on larger displays and in computer presentations, making them unsuitable for professional use.\nDefinition of High Resolution and Low Resolution Images\n1. Low Resolution Images:\nDefinition: Low-resolution images generally have a pixel count under 1 million.\nExample: An image with dimensions 1024x768 pixels gives a total pixel count of 786,432 pixels.\nUsage: These images are suitable for viewing on most standard screens. However, when enlarged, they may lose quality.\n\n2. High Resolution Images:\nDefinition: High-resolution images have a larger number of pixels, usually over 2 million.\nExample: A 1920x1080 image (Full HD) has over 2 million pixels, and a 3840x2160 image (4K UHD) has over 8 million pixels.\nUsage: These images provide more detail and can be enlarged more before losing quality.\n\n\nLow or High Image Resolution in Printing\nFor images intended for printing, the resolution is typically measured in DPI (dots per inch), with high-resolution generally considered to be at least 300 DPI. This means there are 300 dots of color for each inch of the printed image. The higher the DPI, the better the quality of the print.\n\nFor a 6000x4000 pixel photo intended for printing at 300 DPI, the calculations reveal a resulting print size of approximately 20x13 inches at high quality (300 DPI). To print the photo larger without compromising quality, a higher-resolution photo would be required.\nCan You Convert a Low-Resolution Image to High Resolution\nIn short answer: Yes, thanks to advancements in technology, you can convert a low-resolution image to a high-resolution image using AI-based upscaling techniques. \n\nTraditional upscaling methods like bilinear, bicubic, and Lanczos interpolation primarily increase the size of an image without enhancing its quality. By estimating values based on surrounding pixels, these methods generate additional pixels via interpolation, resulting in a larger but potentially blurry or pixelated image. The original detail present in high-resolution images isn't truly added or captured through this process.\n\nAI-based upscaling method, on the other hand, can do more than increasing the image size. It can add new details and remove quality issues like choppy edges and noise. For instance, Super Resolution, one of the most advanced AI upscaling techniques, learns from huge sets of low and high-resolution images. By studying patterns and textures, it figures out what the new pixels in the upscaled image should look like. This allows it to not only make the image larger but also significantly improve its clarity and realism. In simple terms, the AI fills in the gaps, making the image bigger and better, adding missing details for sharper and more realistic results.\n\nHow to Convert Low Resolution Images to High Resolution\nA variety of image upscaler can help convert resolution image to high resolution. Let\u2019s say how to convert low resolution images to high resolution in 4 easiest ways.\n\nUse VideoProc Converter AI\nVideoProc Converter AI can convert images from low resolution such as 480P and 560P to 1080P, 2K, 4K, and even 8K resolution. Thanks to the application of the advanced Super Resolution technology, it can recognize intricate patterns and features in the original image, then intelligently predicts what should be added to the new pixels, resulting in a remarkable up to 400% increase in resolution while preserving the original details without introducing any unwanted artifacts. Better yet, it comes with different models to convert low-resolution real-life images and animes more efficiently and get the best possible result.\n\nVideoProc Converter AI - A Game-Changing AI Image Upscaler\n\uf06c\tUpscale JPEG, PNG, PBM, WebP, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, PPM, PGM, etc\n\uf06c\tConvert low resolution images to up to 8K high resolution\n\uf06c\tIntelligently interpolate pixels without distortion or pixelation\n\uf06c\tDenoising, frame interpolation, stabilization, and more AI features\n\uf06c\tConvert, compress, quick-edit, screen record, and download videos.\n\nStep 1. Download, install, and launch VideoProc Converter AI. Hit Super Resolution. \nStep 2. Drag and drop your images into the software. Select the image type, and VideoProc Converter AI will intelligently apply the most suitable AI upscale model.\nChoose Reality for real-world photos and scenes, such as old family photos or landscape shots from older cameras.\nChoose Anime when handling illustrations and graphics, such as logos or text with blurriness and compression artifacts.\n\nStep 3. Choose the desired scale - 2x, 3x, or 4x - to increase the image resolution. For example, if your low-resolution source image is 512x512, selecting 2x will transform it into 1024x1024, 3x into 1526x1526, and 4x into 2048x2048.\n\nTip: You can apply the same settings to multiple images or right-click on the current image in the list. \n\nStep 4. Select the output image format, and then click RUN to export the high-resolution image. You can also repeat the upscaling process multiple times before reaching the maximum output of 8K, which is nearly 8,000 pixels in width.\n\nUse Fotor\nFotor has been available in the market for over a decade, establishing itself as a versatile photo editing tool accessible both online and as installed software. Beyond basic photo editing functions like cropping and resizing, Fotor sets itself apart with a set of AI-powered features that simplify complex edits with a single click. The background remover, for instance, lets you remove background from your photo effortlessly within seconds. It has a powerful AI Photo Enhance. Notably, it uses artificial intelligence to instantly improve image quality and convert low resolution images to high resolution without making your images too sharp. However, this tool has limitations for users wanting to convert very low-resolution images to high resolution, as it only supports up to 2X resolution upscaling. Let\u2019s say, if your original image is 480 x 480P, Fotor can only upscale it to 960 x 960, which is not considered high resolution.\n\nStep 1. Navigate yourself to the Photo Enhancer tool of Fotor.\nStep 2. Click Enhance Photo Now and select the source low-resolution images for loading to Fotor. It now automatically converts your low-resolution images to high-resolution. \nStep 3. Hit Apply to confirm the changes in the resolution. Hit Done to download the high-resolution version of your images on your computer.\n\nVanceAI\nVanceAI offers a suite of AI-powered solutions to fix, enhance, and retouch photos with ease. The Image Enhancer tool seamlessly upscales images by 2x, 4x, or 8x the original resolution, converting low-resolution images into crisp, high-resolution versions. With access to various upscaling AI models, it intelligently processes photos, anime, CG art, text, and even extremely blurry images using specialized models to deliver optimal results. Plus, users can also adjust blur levels and remove noticeable noise in their images. However, it supports only JPEG, JPG, and PNG images. Another disappointing thing is, while VanceAI does not mention any payment upfront and only requires creating an account, after users upload an image for enhancement, it then prompts for payment before allowing them to download the upscaled high-resolution version.\n\nStep 1. Go to VanceAI.com and click on AI Image Upscaler under the Products menu.\nStep 2. Click the Upload Image button and select the low-resolution image you want to upscale on your computer.\nStep 3. Choose the desired upscale ratio or target resolution for the image. Optionally adjust the Suppress Noise and Remove Blur sliders if needed.\nStep 4. Click Start to Process to have VanceAI convert your low-resolution image to high resolution. Once processing is complete, you can compare the before and after images side-by-side.\nStep 5. Go to the Output Settings section and select JPEG or PNG format. You can also adjust the DPI to 72 for digital printing, 300 for high-quality print, or a custom value. \nStep 6. Click OK. VanceAI will export the high-resolution upscaled image converted from your original low-resolution source image.\n\nGigapixel AI\nTopaz Gigapixel AI is an artificial intelligence-powered software that can effectively convert low-resolution images to high resolution by enlarging images up to 600% their original size while maintaining sharpness and quality. Its machine learning algorithms are continuously trained to learn how to examine patterns and details in order to recreate missing data when upscaling. You can choose from 6 specialized AI models based on image type and fine-tune the results by adjusting noise reduction, blur removal, and compression artifact fixes. One of Gigapixel AI\u2019s killer features is Face Refinement, which applies targeted upscaling to detect even small faces down to 16x16 pixels, enhancing facial details and avoiding the distortions that commonly occur when converting low-resolution images of portraits to high resolution. \n\nStep 1. Go to the official site of Topaz Gigapixel AI. Hit Try for free, enter your email and it starts downloading the online installer. \nStep 2. Double click the installer and follow the instructions to download the image resolution increaser on your computer. Some additional files need to download as well, so it may take a while to fully complete.\nStep 3. Launch Topaz Gigapixel AI. You'll be prompted to download the model files (around 2GB total) used to enhance your photos. You can click OK or choose to download specific models later.\nStep 4. Drag and drop the source low-resolution images to the program. \nStep 5. Select the desired scale ratio from the options (2x, 4x, 6x). This determines the resolution of the high-resolution version.\nStep 6. Go to AI Models and pick the target model that decides how the AI will enhance image details.\nStep 7. Topaz Gigapixel AI will start converting your low-res images to high-res. \nStep 8. Click \"Save Images\" to save the processed images to your computer.\n\nCutout.Pro\nCutOut.pro is a visual design platform powered by artificial intelligence. It offers tools not just for enhancing photos, but also for generating creative and visually-appealing designs from scratch. The AI Photo Enhancer can convert low-resolution images to high resolution in a natural way, without oversharpening. Unfortunately, this process is fully automated so you cannot adjust the output quality, noise reduction level, or any other settings. Another limitation is that images can only be enlarged up to 200% of their original size. Another limitation is that images can only be enlarged up to 200% of their original size.

Better yet, it comes with different models to convert low-resolution real-life images and animes more efficiently and get the best possible result.\n\nVideoProc Converter AI - A Game-Changing AI Image Upscaler\n\uf06c\tUpscale JPEG, PNG, PBM, WebP, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, PPM, PGM, etc\n\uf06c\tConvert low resolution images to up to 8K high resolution\n\uf06c\tIntelligently interpolate pixels without distortion or pixelation\n\uf06c\tDenoising, frame interpolation, stabilization, and more AI features\n\uf06c\tConvert, compress, quick-edit, screen record, and download videos.\n\nStep 1. Download, install, and launch VideoProc Converter AI. Hit Super Resolution. \nStep 2. Drag and drop your images into the software. Select the image type, and VideoProc Converter AI will intelligently apply the most suitable AI upscale model.\nChoose Reality for real-world photos and scenes, such as old family photos or landscape shots from older cameras.\nChoose Anime when handling illustrations and graphics, such as logos or text with blurriness and compression artifacts.\n\nStep 3. Choose the desired scale - 2x, 3x, or 4x - to increase the image resolution. For example, if your low-resolution source image is 512x512, selecting 2x will transform it into 1024x1024, 3x into 1526x1526, and 4x into 2048x2048.\n\nTip: You can apply the same settings to multiple images or right-click on the current image in the list. \n\nStep 4. Select the output image format, and then click RUN to export the high-resolution image. You can also repeat the upscaling process multiple times before reaching the maximum output of 8K, which is nearly 8,000 pixels in width.\n\nUse Fotor\nFotor has been available in the market for over a decade, establishing itself as a versatile photo editing tool accessible both online and as installed software. Beyond basic photo editing functions like cropping and resizing, Fotor sets itself apart with a set of AI-powered features that simplify complex edits with a single click. The background remover, for instance, lets you remove background from your photo effortlessly within seconds. It has a powerful AI Photo Enhance. Notably, it uses artificial intelligence to instantly improve image quality and convert low resolution images to high resolution without making your images too sharp. However, this tool has limitations for users wanting to convert very low-resolution images to high resolution, as it only supports up to 2X resolution upscaling. Let\u2019s say, if your original image is 480 x 480P, Fotor can only upscale it to 960 x 960, which is not considered high resolution.\n\nStep 1. Navigate yourself to the Photo Enhancer tool of Fotor.\nStep 2. Click Enhance Photo Now and select the source low-resolution images for loading to Fotor. It now automatically converts your low-resolution images to high-resolution. \nStep 3. Hit Apply to confirm the changes in the resolution. Hit Done to download the high-resolution version of your images on your computer.\n\nVanceAI\nVanceAI offers a suite of AI-powered solutions to fix, enhance, and retouch photos with ease. The Image Enhancer tool seamlessly upscales images by 2x, 4x, or 8x the original resolution, converting low-resolution images into crisp, high-resolution versions. With access to various upscaling AI models, it intelligently processes photos, anime, CG art, text, and even extremely blurry images using specialized models to deliver optimal results. Plus, users can also adjust blur levels and remove noticeable noise in their images. However, it supports only JPEG, JPG, and PNG images. Another disappointing thing is, while VanceAI does not mention any payment upfront and only requires creating an account, after users upload an image for enhancement, it then prompts for payment before allowing them to download the upscaled high-resolution version.\n\nStep 1. Go to VanceAI.com and click on AI Image Upscaler under the Products menu.\nStep 2. Click the Upload Image button and select the low-resolution image you want to upscale on your computer.\nStep 3. Choose the desired upscale ratio or target resolution for the image. Optionally adjust the Suppress Noise and Remove Blur sliders if needed.\nStep 4. Click Start to Process to have VanceAI convert your low-resolution image to high resolution. Once processing is complete, you can compare the before and after images side-by-side.\nStep 5. Go to the Output Settings section and select JPEG or PNG format. You can also adjust the DPI to 72 for digital printing, 300 for high-quality print, or a custom value. \nStep 6. Click OK. VanceAI will export the high-resolution upscaled image converted from your original low-resolution source image.\n\nGigapixel AI\nTopaz Gigapixel AI is an artificial intelligence-powered software that can effectively convert low-resolution images to high resolution by enlarging images up to 600% their original size while maintaining sharpness and quality. Its machine learning algorithms are continuously trained to learn how to examine patterns and details in order to recreate missing data when upscaling. You can choose from 6 specialized AI models based on image type and fine-tune the results by adjusting noise reduction, blur removal, and compression artifact fixes. One of Gigapixel AI\u2019s killer features is Face Refinement, which applies targeted upscaling to detect even small faces down to 16x16 pixels, enhancing facial details and avoiding the distortions that commonly occur when converting low-resolution images of portraits to high resolution. \n\nStep 1. Go to the official site of Topaz Gigapixel AI. Hit Try for free, enter your email and it starts downloading the online installer. \nStep 2. Double click the installer and follow the instructions to download the image resolution increaser on your computer. Some additional files need to download as well, so it may take a while to fully complete.\nStep 3. Launch Topaz Gigapixel AI. You'll be prompted to download the model files (around 2GB total) used to enhance your photos. You can click OK or choose to download specific models later.\nStep 4. Drag and drop the source low-resolution images to the program. \nStep 5. Select the desired scale ratio from the options (2x, 4x, 6x). This determines the resolution of the high-resolution version.\nStep 6. Go to AI Models and pick the target model that decides how the AI will enhance image details.\nStep 7. Topaz Gigapixel AI will start converting your low-res images to high-res. \nStep 8. Click \"Save Images\" to save the processed images to your computer.\n\nCutout.Pro\nCutOut.pro is a visual design platform powered by artificial intelligence. It offers tools not just for enhancing photos, but also for generating creative and visually-appealing designs from scratch. The AI Photo Enhancer can convert low-resolution images to high resolution in a natural way, without oversharpening. Unfortunately, this process is fully automated so you cannot adjust the output quality, noise reduction level, or any other settings. Another limitation is that images can only be enlarged up to 200% of their original size. Another limitation is that images can only be enlarged up to 200% of their original size. This may make the tool useless for converting heavily cropped images, poor quality photos from low megapixel cameras, and images with reso"}}

An additional 2.5 cm was cut off of one of the cups to ensure this cup could fit comfortably\ninto the other cup. A hole with a diameter of 0.5 cm was cut into the bottom of the shorter cup. A\nthermometer was inserted into the hole and it made a loud, high-pitched noise. While\n\u2018conducting each reaction, the reactants were placed into the taller cup without the hole, and the\nshorter cup with the thermometer was immediately placed upside down, with the hole for the\nthermometer facing up, and firmly into the taller cup, to not let any heat escape.\n\nFo tha fret raartinn 25 Ami. af NaH and HOI ware canarataly maaeirad aid and tha. here is another: bd\nFor this experiment, a calorimeter was constructed and used for each test. When the calorimeter\n\n\u2018was constructed, two DART 12112 styrofoam coffee cups were used. For one cup, five pencil marks,\n\nmeasuring 5.2 cm, were placed around the brim of the cup using a 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical\n\nPencil. Using these marks as a guide, 5.2 cm was cut around the brim of the cup using Westcott scissors.\n\nA hole for the glass alcohol thermometer was then formed on the bottom of this cup by gently poking its\n\nbase with the 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical Pencil until it reached a diameter of 0.5 cm. On the other\n\nDART 1212 styrofoam coffee cup, the same steps used to construct the first cup were repeated,\n\nhowever, a hole was not made on the base of this cup, and the measurements, marks, and cut made off\n\nof the brim measured 1.5 cm instead. Following this, six pieces of Nashua 345 Industrial Grade Duct Tape\n\nmeasuring 4.0 cm in length and 8.3 cm in width were cut and set aside. The design of this calorimeter\n\nwas a controlled variable as it remained constant throughout the experiment. Providing the same\n\nenvironment for all reactions was a significant factor as it allowed for consistency in results.\nCE. keep in mind these are just excerpts from the lab report, not the entire things: ee\nTo construct the styrofoam calorimeter, two DART 12112 coffee cups were stacked. The frst cup, |\n\nacting as the lid for the calorimeter, had 2.3 cm trimmed off the rim using stainless steel Wescott |\nscissors. A hole with a 0.6 cm diameter was punctured using a STAEDTLER graphite pencil on the bottom |\nof the first cup to hold the thermometer. The second cup was uncut and was used as the base cup of the |\ncalorimeter. The first cup was placed into the second styrofoam cup tightly with the rim facing down. |\nOnce stacked, a glass alcohol thermometer was inserted into the hole of the first styrofoam cup to |\nmeasure temperature without touching the bottom of the second cup. The constructed calorimeter and |\nthermometer were controlled variables in the experiment since they were used for each test. |\nOnce the calorimeter was prepared, the neutralization reaction was conducted where 25.0 mL of |\n\n1.0M NaOH and 25.0 mL of 1.0M HCl was measured. Their temperatures were measured using a. Materials and Methods\n\nThis lab was composed of three experiments. Throughout, the same styrofoam\ncalorimeter was used, allowing it to be a control variable. Two white styrofoam DART 12J12 J\nCup\u00ae cups were used to make the calorimeter. On one of the cups five marks were made\naround the cup, each measuring 1.5 cm off the brim, and used as guides. Following this guide,\n1.5 cm was cut off all around the brim off the cup. On the second cup, the steps to measure,\nmark and cut were repeated for this cup, using a measurement of 5.2 cm off the brim. Next, the\nip of a 0.7 mm Paper Mate mechanical pencil was used to pierce 20 small holes in the middle\nof the cups base at the bottom. Gradually, a hole measuring 0.5 cm in diameter was created\nwide enough to snuggly fit a laboratory glass alcohol thermometer. This resulted in one cup that\nmeasured 9.68 cm in height, the calorimeter, and another that measured 5.98 cm in height and\nhad a hole, the lid. It is assumed that no heat was transferred, absorbed or released by and\nbetween the calorimeter and the surroundings.\n\nIn all experiments. proper safety precautions were observed and the initial temperatures\n\n", "scoring_data": {"prompt": "i have to write a chemistry lab report materials and methods section. this is the lab: Part 1: Molar Enthalpy of a Chemical Change\n\nIn this investigation, you will carry out a reaction in a coffee-cup calorimeter and measure the energy transfer between the chemical system and the surroundings.

An additional 2.5 cm was cut off of one of the cups to ensure this cup could fit comfortably\ninto the other cup. A hole with a diameter of 0.5 cm was cut into the bottom of the shorter cup. A\nthermometer was inserted into the hole and it made a loud, high-pitched noise. While\n\u2018conducting each reaction, the reactants were placed into the taller cup without the hole, and the\nshorter cup with the thermometer was immediately placed upside down, with the hole for the\nthermometer facing up, and firmly into the taller cup, to not let any heat escape.\n\nFo tha fret raartinn 25 Ami. af NaH and HOI ware canarataly maaeirad aid and tha. here is another: bd\nFor this experiment, a calorimeter was constructed and used for each test. When the calorimeter\n\n\u2018was constructed, two DART 12112 styrofoam coffee cups were used. For one cup, five pencil marks,\n\nmeasuring 5.2 cm, were placed around the brim of the cup using a 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical\n\nPencil. Using these marks as a guide, 5.2 cm was cut around the brim of the cup using Westcott scissors.\n\nA hole for the glass alcohol thermometer was then formed on the bottom of this cup by gently poking its\n\nbase with the 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical Pencil until it reached a diameter of 0.5 cm. On the other\n\nDART 1212 styrofoam coffee cup, the same steps used to construct the first cup were repeated,\n\nhowever, a hole was not made on the base of this cup, and the measurements, marks, and cut made off\n\nof the brim measured 1.5 cm instead. Following this, six pieces of Nashua 345 Industrial Grade Duct Tape\n\nmeasuring 4.0 cm in length and 8.3 cm in width were cut and set aside. The design of this calorimeter\n\nwas a controlled variable as it remained constant throughout the experiment. Providing the same\n\nenvironment for all reactions was a significant factor as it allowed for consistency in results.\nCE. keep in mind these are just excerpts from the lab report, not the entire things: ee\nTo construct the styrofoam calorimeter, two DART 12112 coffee cups were stacked. The frst cup, |\n\nacting as the lid for the calorimeter, had 2.3 cm trimmed off the rim using stainless steel Wescott |\nscissors. A hole with a 0.6 cm diameter was punctured using a STAEDTLER graphite pencil on the bottom |\nof the first cup to hold the thermometer. The second cup was uncut and was used as the base cup of the |\ncalorimeter. The first cup was placed into the second styrofoam cup tightly with the rim facing down. |\nOnce stacked, a glass alcohol thermometer was inserted into the hole of the first styrofoam cup to |\nmeasure temperature without touching the bottom of the second cup. The constructed calorimeter and |\nthermometer were controlled variables in the experiment since they were used for each test. |\nOnce the calorimeter was prepared, the neutralization reaction was conducted where 25.0 mL of |\n\n1.0M NaOH and 25.0 mL of 1.0M HCl was measured. Their temperatures were measured using a. Materials and Methods\n\nThis lab was composed of three experiments. Throughout, the same styrofoam\ncalorimeter was used, allowing it to be a control variable. Two white styrofoam DART 12J12 J\nCup\u00ae cups were used to make the calorimeter. On one of the cups five marks were made\naround the cup, each measuring 1.5 cm off the brim, and used as guides. Following this guide,\n1.5 cm was cut off all around the brim off the cup. On the second cup, the steps to measure,\nmark and cut were repeated for this cup, using a measurement of 5.2 cm off the brim. Next, the\nip of a 0.7 mm Paper Mate mechanical pencil was used to pierce 20 small holes in the middle\nof the cups base at the bottom. Gradually, a hole measuring 0.5 cm in diameter was created\nwide enough to snuggly fit a laboratory glass alcohol thermometer. This resulted in one cup that\nmeasured 9.68 cm in height, the calorimeter, and another that measured 5.98 cm in height and\nhad a hole, the lid. It is assumed that no heat was transferred, absorbed or released by and\nbetween the calorimeter and the surroundings.\n\nIn all experiments. proper safety precautions were observed and the initial temperatures\n\n"}}

{"id": 74125158, "input": "Summarize this article: \n\nMapleStory developer Nexon is being hit with a sizable fine by the Korean Fair Trade Commission over what the body says are deceptive loot box practices.\n\nAs reported by the Korean Times and Business Korea, Nexon is being fined some $8.85 million (about 11.6 billion won) for allegedly lowering the probabilities of some loot box items capable of upgrading player equipment,, known as Cubes, without telling players According to the Korean Times, it is the largest fine of this type levied to date.\n\n\nNexon is being fined nearly $9 million for what is being called deceptive loot box practices.\nNEXON IS BEING FINED NEARLY $9 MILLION FOR WHAT IS BEING CALLED DECEPTIVE LOOT BOX PRACTICES.\nThe judgment claims that Nexon engaged in these practices for more than 10 years in a period dating back to 2010, including secretly lowering the loot box odds for some items to near zero. The findings were reportedly based on internal documents obtained from Nexon.\n\n\"Nexon made announcements about changes to the games hundreds of times from 2010-21, but it omitted the information about the probability adjustment,\" the KTFC said in a statement. It added, \"Our judgment is that the company had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means.\"\n\nLoot boxes have become less popular in recent years owing to the intense backlash from fans. Instead, developers are more likely to favor the battle pass model pioneered by the likes of Dota 2 and Fortnite. However, loot boxes remain prevalent in mobile games and sports games, and they are a hot button issue for regulators.\n\nNexon in particular has become known for its aggressive monetization practices. Last year, IGN reported on MapleStory's controversial \"New Age\" update, which made it more difficult for players in certain regions to farm a key currency while the price of some items were inflated.

The findings were reportedly based on internal documents obtained from Nexon.\n\n\"Nexon made announcements about changes to the games hundreds of times from 2010-21, but it omitted the information about the probability adjustment,\" the KTFC said in a statement. It added, \"Our judgment is that the company had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means.\"\n\nLoot boxes have become less popular in recent years owing to the intense backlash from fans. Instead, developers are more likely to favor the battle pass model pioneered by the likes of Dota 2 and Fortnite. However, loot boxes remain prevalent in mobile games and sports games, and they are a hot button issue for regulators.\n\nNexon in particular has become known for its aggressive monetization practices.

Yes, your own money can earn money for you\u2026and lots of it! People who are rich know this for a fact. But most of us in the middle class don\u2019t.\n\nAfter all, our school and college education has never taught us this way to earn money. And neither have our parents.\n\nWhat we have always learnt is to study well, get a good job, earn money, and save for the future. Nobody has really told us that there\u2019s one more aspect to our working and earning life \u2013 investing for the future. Learning how to compound our money.\n\nCompounding is extremely powerful.\n\nEinstein was once quoted saying \u201cThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\u201d He is also rumoured to call it the \u2018ninth wonder\u2019 of the world.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard about \u2018compound interest\u2019, it is defined as the interest on an investment\u2019s interest plus the investment amount.\n\nTo explain it in simple terms, let\u2019s assume you invested just Rs 100 in a savings account that earned 10% interest per annum. In one year\u2019s time you would have Rs 110 in your account. The following year you would be earning 10% not only on your original Rs 100 but also on the Rs 10 you had earned as interest in the first year.\n\nNow you would find this as a fickle example, and see no reason Einstein called it a powerful phenomenon. But don\u2019t make the mistake which this king made. The king was so impressed with the game of chess that he invited the man who invented chess and asked him to name his reward.\n\nThe man, pointing to a chess board before the king said, \u201cYour highness, if you place just one grain of rice on the first square of this chess board, and double it for every square, I will consider myself well rewarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the king asked, highly surprised. \u201cJust grains of rice, not gold?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, your highness\u201d affirmed the humble inventor.\n\n\u201cSo it shall be!\u201d ordered the king, and his courtiers started placing the grain on the chess board. One grain on the first square, 2 on the second, 4 on the third, 8 on the fourth and so on. By the time they came to the 10th square they had to place 512 grains of rice. The number swelled to 5.2 lac grains on the 20th square. When they came to the half way mark, the 32nd square, the grain count was 214 crore! Soon the count increased to lakhs of crore and eventually the hapless king had to hand over his entire kingdom to the clever inventor.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of compounding that you must understand and appreciate!\n\nHere is a chart that shows how much Rs 1,000 will grow to in 25 years, at 10% return per annum compounded (to Rs 10,835).\n\nsn_university_image5\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t my money compounding in Fixed Deposits?\u201d You might want to ask.\n\nNo it\u2019s not. It may well be shrinking.\n\nMost Indian middle-class households \u2018save\u2019 money \u2013 in safe deposits of banks and post offices, or in the form of gold and silver and assume that they have invested the money. You might be one of them too.\n\nBut do you know how much our money grows when kept in these \u2018safe\u2019 places?\n\nA bank account can give you a maximum of 3-4% interest per year. A bank fixed deposit or a post office saving will give you somewhat better, but only 6-7%. Gold and silver won\u2019t earn you anything till the time you don\u2019t sell them. And as far as property is concerned, in a normal year, it can rise at an 8-10% rate as well.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t these good returns?\u201d you might ask. Not really, let me say!\n\nWhile calculating your \u2018real\u2019 return from all these or any other avenue, we must also take into account the \u2018inflation\u2019 factor.\n\nIn simple terms, inflation is nothing but a rise in prices of things that we consume. So, if we are paying Rs 50 a kg for onions today while these were costing Rs 10 a kg one year back, the rate of inflation is a whopping 400%. But this is an exception.\n\nInflation is India has generally been in the 5-7% range over the past many years. And it is expected to remain in this range in the future as well, notwithstanding sharp spikes and falls in between.\n\nSo, when you calculate the \u2018real\u2019 return on your investment, you must reduce the inflation rate from your total return. Like, if your bank account gives you an annual interest of 4% while inflation is at 5%, your real return equals a negative 1% (-1%). And if a fixed deposit gives you 8%, your real return will stand at 3% (8% minus 5%).\n\nNow do you think that this kind of return is fine, especially when inflation rate is only going to rise in the future (given the rising shortage of everything we consume)?\n\nIt isn\u2019t. I mean this is not what we can call \u2018growth of our money\u2019. Inflation actually eats into our money. And how?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you have Rs 100 with you are looking to buy onions. At a rate of Rs 10 per kg, you will end up buying 10 kg of it. But what is the price rises to Rs 50 a kg after one year while you still have only Rs 100 to spend?\n\nIn that case, you will be able to buy only 2 kg of onions. That\u2019s the negative effect of inflation \u2013 the value of every rupee you will have in the future will be lesser than the value of that one rupee today. And that\u2019s the where the concept of investing and inflation comes into play. To grow your money fast at a time when inflation is eating into it is very important.\n\nForget onions. Look at the total cost of living that is rising at such a fast pace these days that that we need to prepare ourselves well to meet our future financial obligations. And these can include our children\u2019s high education and marriage, our parents\u2019 healthcare needs, and our own retirement. All these are big expense items and as such we need to save and invest a lot to collect their kind of money over the next 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.\n\nLet us now look at how many years you will take to accumulate Rs 10 lac for your new born daughter\u2019s higher education 18 years down the line, if we start with Rs 2 lac today. We will assume real returns (total return minus inflation of 5%) of different avenues to arrive at this number.\n\nHere\u2019s the chart that shows it all.\n\nsn_university_image5\n\nNote: Real returns (shown inside brackets) are calculated assuming inflation rate of 5%\n\nAs the above chart shows, the only way to meet you target of reaching Rs 10 lac (if you start with Rs 2 lac today) in 18 years is to invest in stocks. While your bank FD will not get you anywhere, the property route will take a much longer time that what your requirement (of 18 years) permits.\n\nThese calculations are not based on some random numbers. These are exactly what these investment avenues have earned over the long term in the past.\n\nThus we arrive at the fascinating (though risky) world of stock markets \u2013 one of the most critical investment avenues that can help you achieve your long term financial goals.\n\nI just said that stock market is a risky place, but so are our lives. There is always a risk in anything we do. But then, with the right education and research, we can minimize that risk. And as we get more education, we can better decide how much risk we want to take and conversely how much return we can make safely.\n\nUnderstanding the risks is the first step toward minimizing them. In fact, it is possible to make 10-15% annual return on your stock market investment with almost no risk. But only if you know what you are doing.\n\nLet me explain the The Law of The Farm to drill down the importance of right knowledge and patience in stock market investing.\n\nThere are certain laws, like the law of gravity which you cannot repeal. These laws govern the universe. One such law is the Law of the Farm.\n\nThis law states that a farmer cannot expect to harvest a great crop unless he carefully plans for the development of that crop and works diligently and consistently over a long period of time.\n\nThe farmer first needs to prepare and fertilize the soil, plant the seed, water and nourish the sapling, tend to the weeds, protect it from the insects and diseases and constantly monitor before the time for harvest comes. The farmer cannot plant a crop, do nothing for six months, and then expect to have a great harvest magically.\n\nThese things take ongoing effort throughout the whole process.\n\nBut, ironically, in the stock market, most of us would want our stocks \u2013 mostly bought on tips and borrowed conviction \u2013 to fly and earn us fast returns. We somehow think we can dismiss natural processes, cheat the system, and still win the day.\n\nWarren Buffett wrote this in his 1985 letter to shareholders\u2026\n\nNo matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: you can\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\n\nAs on the real farm, success in life, business, and investing comes from regular disciplined, regular effort.\n\nYou can go for the quick fixes and techniques with apparent success in the short run (like four-baggers in four months). But in the long run they just don\u2019t work.\n\nSo please remember, in investing as in farming, a rich harvest would come to you not from finding easy shortcuts, but from disciplined, focused effort, directed tirelessly toward a desirable goal.\n\nThere are many paths you can go down when you get into investing in the stock market. But there\u2019s one thing you can be sure of. With education and research you will make money.\n\nYou are already beginning your education here. That\u2019s a great start! Continue on this road and make your money work for you.", "scoring_data": {"prompt": "Extract key points from this text:\nLesson #1: Why Invest In Stock Markets?\nValue Investing Masterclass - Safal NiveshakValue Investing Masterclass is a course that will teach you the simple and sensible strategies to invest in the stock markets to grow your wealth over the long term.\n\nBut since this is the very first lesson, let us answer this question to start off with\u2026\n\nWhy invest at all?\nAll of us have a long list of financial goals, starting with things like paying the EMI of our house, putting food on the table, and paying all other bills so that we live comfortable lives.\n\nWhen you work your way down the list, you get to things like replacing the old car, buying a second house, putting the kids through college, and retiring.\n\nYou see, most of our wants, including a luxury car and a foreign holiday that you\u2019ve promised your wife, will exceed our expected lifetime earnings.\n\nForget the wants, how do plan to meet at least the critical financial needs that will arise in the future \u2013 like putting the kids through college, and your own retirement?\n\nYou already toil hard, sacrifice your personal life, and sometimes your health to earn money to meet your expenses and save for the future.\n\nBut amidst all this, how much thought do you give to the fact that you can take help from \u2018someone else\u2019 as well to earn us more money to help you meet all your financial goals in the future?\n\nThat \u2018someone else\u2019 is none other than your own money \u2013 what you are earning and saving today. Yes, your own money can earn money for you\u2026and lots of it! People who are rich know this for a fact. But most of us in the middle class don\u2019t.\n\nAfter all, our school and college education has never taught us this way to earn money. And neither have our parents.\n\nWhat we have always learnt is to study well, get a good job, earn money, and save for the future. Nobody has really told us that there\u2019s one more aspect to our working and earning life \u2013 investing for the future. Learning how to compound our money.\n\nCompounding is extremely powerful.\n\nEinstein was once quoted saying \u201cThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\u201d He is also rumoured to call it the \u2018ninth wonder\u2019 of the world.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard about \u2018compound interest\u2019, it is defined as the interest on an investment\u2019s interest plus the investment amount.\n\nTo explain it in simple terms, let\u2019s assume you invested just Rs 100 in a savings account that earned 10% interest per annum. In one year\u2019s time you would have Rs 110 in your account. The following year you would be earning 10% not only on your original Rs 100 but also on the Rs 10 you had earned as interest in the first year.\n\nNow you would find this as a fickle example, and see no reason Einstein called it a powerful phenomenon. But don\u2019t make the mistake which this king made. The king was so impressed with the game of chess that he invited the man who invented chess and asked him to name his reward.\n\nThe man, pointing to a chess board before the king said, \u201cYour highness, if you place just one grain of rice on the first square of this chess board, and double it for every square, I will consider myself well rewarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the king asked, highly surprised. \u201cJust grains of rice, not gold?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, your highness\u201d affirmed the humble inventor.\n\n\u201cSo it shall be!\u201d ordered the king, and his courtiers started placing the grain on the chess board. One grain on the first square, 2 on the second, 4 on the third, 8 on the fourth and so on. By the time they came to the 10th square they had to place 512 grains of rice. The number swelled to 5.2 lac grains on the 20th square. When they came to the half way mark, the 32nd square, the grain count was 214 crore! Soon the count increased to lakhs of crore and eventually the hapless king had to hand over his entire kingdom to the clever inventor.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of compounding that you must understand and appreciate!\n\nHere is a chart that shows how much Rs 1,000 will grow to in 25 years, at 10% return per annum compounded (to Rs 10,835).\n\nsn_university_image5\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t my money compounding in Fixed Deposits?\u201d You might want to ask.\n\nNo it\u2019s not. It may well be shrinking.\n\nMost Indian middle-class households \u2018save\u2019 money \u2013 in safe deposits of banks and post offices, or in the form of gold and silver and assume that they have invested the money. You might be one of them too.\n\nBut do you know how much our money grows when kept in these \u2018safe\u2019 places?\n\nA bank account can give you a maximum of 3-4% interest per year. A bank fixed deposit or a post office saving will give you somewhat better, but only 6-7%. Gold and silver won\u2019t earn you anything till the time you don\u2019t sell them. And as far as property is concerned, in a normal year, it can rise at an 8-10% rate as well.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t these good returns?\u201d you might ask. Not really, let me say!\n\nWhile calculating your \u2018real\u2019 return from all these or any other avenue, we must also take into account the \u2018inflation\u2019 factor.\n\nIn simple terms, inflation is nothing but a rise in prices of things that we consume. So, if we are paying Rs 50 a kg for onions today while these were costing Rs 10 a kg one year back, the rate of inflation is a whopping 400%. But this is an exception.\n\nInflation is India has generally been in the 5-7% range over the past many years. And it is expected to remain in this range in the future as well, notwithstanding sharp spikes and falls in between.\n\nSo, when you calculate the \u2018real\u2019 return on your investment, you must reduce the inflation rate from your total return. Like, if your bank account gives you an annual interest of 4% while inflation is at 5%, your real return equals a negative 1% (-1%). And if a fixed deposit gives you 8%, your real return will stand at 3% (8% minus 5%).\n\nNow do you think that this kind of return is fine, especially when inflation rate is only going to rise in the future (given the rising shortage of everything we consume)?\n\nIt isn\u2019t. I mean this is not what we can call \u2018growth of our money\u2019. Inflation actually eats into our money. And how?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you have Rs 100 with you are looking to buy onions. At a rate of Rs 10 per kg, you will end up buying 10 kg of it. But what is the price rises to Rs 50 a kg after one year while you still have only Rs 100 to spend?\n\nIn that case, you will be able to buy only 2 kg of onions. That\u2019s the negative effect of inflation \u2013 the value of every rupee you will have in the future will be lesser than the value of that one rupee today. And that\u2019s the where the concept of investing and inflation comes into play. To grow your money fast at a time when inflation is eating into it is very important.\n\nForget onions.

{"id": 43053669, "input": "Summarize this article:\n\nAmabel Holland, a forty-one-year-old board-game designer from Dearborn, Michigan, believes that a chance discovery at a comic-book store saved her life. In 2010, she wandered into the shop with her wife and a friend, looking for issues of the Marvel series \u201cThe New Mutants.\u201d In the basement, she noticed a board game called The Settlers of Catan. It was a 3-D edition, costing more than two hundred dollars. Amabel didn\u2019t particularly want to play the game, but she was surprised by its fanciness. She browsed the store some more and noticed that many games\u2019 boxes prominently displayed the names of their designers, as if they were authors. This wasn\u2019t the familiar childhood terrain of Monopoly, Candy Land, and Sorry! These games were often dauntingly complex, and engaged with topics like history, politics, and the building of industries and empires.\n\nAfter visiting the store, Amabel and her wife, Mary Holland, played a few board games, and eventually Amabel tried designing one. She\u2019d spent years creating music, comics, and films without attracting much of an audience, and had felt some despair about her artistic work. But Amabel, who is autistic, thinks about the world in terms of systems, and she suspected that in games she might find her voice. You could make a board game about almost anything, and, when you did, its rules could both mirror and analyze the subject on which it was based.\n\nOver the next few years, Amabel designed and published about thirty games through various companies. Then, in 2016, she and Mary created their own publisher, Hollandspiele. It\u2019s since published more than seventy games, roughly half designed by Amabel; she is widely considered one of today\u2019s most innovative game designers. Her work, which is part of a larger turn toward complexity in the industry, often tackles historical and social subjects\u2014death, religion, misinformation\u2014using surprising \u201cmechanics,\u201d or building blocks of game play, to immerse players in an experience. \u201cI\u2019m interested in games\u2019 ability to engage with difficult topics,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m interested in the way that mechanics can be used to do that.\u201d\n\nMechanics can be appealingly simple, as they are in checkers. But games with richer mechanics can offer richer experiences. In Monopoly, which was published in 1935, you can roll dice to move, auction assets, build properties on tiles, and draw special-power cards (\u201cGet Out of Jail Free\u201d). Things escalate from there. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a lot of innovation in the last twenty years,\u201d Amabel said. A recent encyclopedia of mechanics in tabletop games\u2014a category that includes board games, card games (such as Magic: The Gathering), and party games (such as Codenames)\u2014defines close to two hundred.\n\n\u201cWith every game, you build a certain model of the world,\u201d Reiner Knizia, a former mathematician who\u2019s designed more than eight hundred games, told me. Several of his games illustrate market forces: in Modern Art, for instance, you play as auctioneers and buyers, hoping to buy low and sell high. Knizia is a traditional game designer inasmuch as he aims to \u201cbring enjoyment to the people.\u201d But Amabel sometimes aims for the opposite of enjoyment. Her game This Guilty Land, from 2018, is about the struggle to end slavery; The Vote, from 2020, is about women\u2019s suffrage. \u201cThey\u2019re meant to evoke frustration,\u201d she said\u2014to demonstrate the difficulty of political progress\u2014\u201cwhich is not usually what people are looking for in games.\u201d\n\nLately, Amabel has been trying to combine the heavy with the light. One of her newest games, Kaiju Table Battles, uses carefully calibrated mechanics to tackle the highly personal topic of gender transition in a way that is both uplifting and widely appealing. (Until 2021, she published under the name Tom Russell.) Through colorful, Godzilla-like creatures, it tells the story of how Amabel became Amabel.\n\nThe world of board games began to transform in the nineteen-nineties. Catan, which was first published in Germany, in 1995, helped popularize \u201cEuro-style\u201d games over \u201cAmeritrash\u201d titles that often depended on randomness, direct conflict, and dramatic shifts of fortune. (Back to square one!) Eurogames tended to reward planning, and allowed players to interact indirectly\u2014by acquiring coveted building materials, for instance. Since then, the industry has seen a steady increase in complex games. In 2021, researchers analyzed the ten thousand games with the highest rankings on the Web site BoardGameGeek, and found that, between 2000 and 2020, the average number of mechanics in new games had increased from roughly two and a half to four. The 2017 game Gloomhaven, which held the highest rating on the site for years, utilizes nineteen mechanics.\n\n\u201cDesigners are becoming more focussed on the experience the players are having, and are using a stronger tool kit to build better games,\u201d Geoff Engelstein, who teaches board-game design at New York University and co-authored the encyclopedia of game mechanics, told me. In older games, he said, such as Risk and Monopoly, the goal was, frequently, to tear everyone else down, but in newer games this is often impossible; in the train game Ticket to Ride, for example, you can\u2019t destroy other players\u2019 tracks. It\u2019s also become less common to lose a turn, which makes players less engaged, and games are increasingly designed to prevent blowouts by winners. Rob Daviau, the co-designer of Pandemic Legacy, the current No. 2 game on BoardGameGeek, is a co-owner of Restoration Games, a company that republishes older games while updating their mechanics. One common shift, he said, is from post-decision luck to pre-decision luck. Instead of striking a monster and then rolling the dice to see if you\u2019ve caused damage, you roll the dice first, then have to get creative about how to use what you\u2019ve rolled.\n\nA few games have introduced entirely new mechanics. Dominion, from 2008, popularized deck-building, in which players curate a collection of cards that grant points or powers. (The same mechanic is used in Magic: The Gathering.) Risk Legacy, another game co-designed by Daviau, inaugurated legacy games, in which \u201cgame states\u201d\u2014changes to the board, characters, or rules\u2014carry over from session to session. (Daviau, who once worked for Hasbro, came up with the concept while talking about Clue at a brainstorming session. \u201cI don\u2019t know why these people keep coming over to dinner!\u201d he said.)\n\nAmabel\u2019s game Kaiju Table Battles uses a legacy system: in the course of multiple sessions, players unseal envelopes containing new content. While working on it, she watched most of the Godzilla and Gamera movies; she also created her own monsters, commissioned art, and built a prototype. When I visited her, she was in the mechanics phase\u2014\u201cthe nitty gritty of figuring out, What exactly does this monster do?\u201d she explained. In the movies, monsters like Godzilla represent big, intangible fears, such as the atomic bomb. But Amabel identified more with the strange beasts than with the people trying to kill them; she wanted to make a game in which the monsters developed and grew. One of her characters, a plant monster, would obey unique mechanics: it would be fragile and push other monsters away. \u201cSo it\u2019s very lonely and isolated,\u201d Amabel said. \u201cBut then it will evolve and go from being this kind of weird, viny, weedy plant to a flowering plant and come into its power. It\u2019s going to be stronger, and actually help other monsters work better, and have more sense of community, because it\u2019s actually acting as itself.\u201d\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nThe Night Doctrine: The Lives Lost to a U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan\n\nAmabel describes herself as a \u201cshitposter\u201d\u2014someone who is wrong on purpose in a funny, adversarial way that can still get at the truth. On social media, where she writes about game design and her dating life\u2014she and Mary separated, in 2021\u2014she explains that, although many of her games are historical, they are not \u201c \u2018balanced\u2019 works of history\u201d but \u201cpolitical art\u201d and \u201cqueer rage & shitposting all the way down.\u201d Recently, she has published games about Dracula, the tobacco industry (her father died of lung cancer), and the Shackleton expedition. The latter game, called Endurance, has no \u201cvictory condition\u201d; your only hope is to limit your losses as crew members die. In reality, all of Ernest Shackleton\u2019s men survived their failed attempt to reach the South Pole\u2014but the game models the circumstances, not the outcome, and expresses deeper ideas about adversity. On a podcast hosted by the game reviewer Daniel Thurot, Amabel explained that she could not have made Endurance before her gender transition. \u201cIt was kind of living through my own misery and my own miracle that made me think about the odds,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the odds of me figuring out my shit were, like, so long.\u201d She found time to think about her gender only because she\u2019d left an office job to work on games full time; she undertook her transition with the help of a trans woman, Erin Escobedo, who\u2019d created a game published by Hollandspiele; Escobedo, in turn, had learned about the company only because it had previously published a title by a big-time designer named Cole Wehrle, who knew Amabel because of Amabel\u2019s first game, Northern Pacific. \u201cIf all those things didn\u2019t happen, I don\u2019t know if I would be here today talking to you,\u201d she told Thurot. Endurance is a game in which anything can, and usually does, go wrong.\n\nThe recent explosion in the popularity of board games\u2014the industry\u2019s annual revenue is expected to increase from around a billion dollars in 2017 to nearly five billion in 2026\u2014has vastly expanded the number and variety of games that can be published. Crowdfunding, online communities, and on-demand printing have also contributed. Independent designers can now find dedicated audiences. The Zenobia Award celebrates designers from marginalized groups who are creating historical games; recent winning games have centered on subjects including caste in India under colonialism, the functions of Machu Picchu, and an economic system used by Cherokee people in the sixteenth century. In 2019, Elizabeth Hargrave released Wingspan, a beautifully illustrated Euro-style game about birds; nearly two million copies are in print. Historically, she told me, most players and designers and publishers of games have been men; the industry is slowly escaping their grip. \u201cNot everybody enjoys killing monsters in dungeons,\u201d said Isaac Childres, the designer of Gloomhaven, which is about killing monsters in dungeons.\n\nJohn du Bois, a game designer whom Hollandspiele has published, met me and Amabel at the apartment of Amabel\u2019s girlfriend, Samhain Bones. (Bones, who named herself Samhain after the Halloween-adjacent pagan holiday when she transitioned a few years ago, had on a pink tank top that said \u201cBE GAY DO CRIME!\u201d and skeletal wrist warmers.) This gave us a foursome for sampling some modern games. We started with Amabel\u2019s Northern Pacific. The board shows a network of potential paths connecting cities. Players must build train tracks connecting Minneapolis to Seattle; on each turn, they can either place a cube on a city and hope that a train comes there, or place a train on a track segment. One tactic is to see where an opponent might direct her trains and place your own cubes to reap the rewards. \u201cIt\u2019s about leaving your opponents with the most bad choices,\u201d du Bois said.\n\nNext was Turncoats, from another publisher, Milda Matilda Games. A map contains eleven adjacent regions and a smattering of stones in three colors. Each player receives eight stones to hide in her hand; she can either place them on the map or take actions to alter their distribution in her hand or on the map. At the end of the game, the player who holds in her hand the color that has dominated the most regions on the map is the winner. The trick is to guide the board toward a certain color without depleting that color f", "scoring_data": {"prompt": "Summarize this article:\n\nAmabel Holland, a forty-one-year-old board-game designer from Dearborn, Michigan, believes that a chance discovery at a comic-book store saved her life.

On a podcast hosted by the game reviewer Daniel Thurot, Amabel explained that she could not have made Endurance before her gender transition. \u201cIt was kind of living through my own misery and my own miracle that made me think about the odds,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the odds of me figuring out my shit were, like, so long.\u201d She found time to think about her gender only because she\u2019d left an office job to work on games full time; she undertook her transition with the help of a trans woman, Erin Escobedo, who\u2019d created a game published by Hollandspiele; Escobedo, in turn, had learned about the company only because it had previously published a title by a big-time designer named Cole Wehrle, who knew Amabel because of Amabel\u2019s first game, Northern Pacific. \u201cIf all those things didn\u2019t happen, I don\u2019t know if I would be here today talking to you,\u201d she told Thurot. Endurance is a game in which anything can, and usually does, go wrong.\n\nThe recent explosion in the popularity of board games\u2014the industry\u2019s annual revenue is expected to increase from around a billion dollars in 2017 to nearly five billion in 2026\u2014has vastly expanded the number and variety of games that can be published. Crowdfunding, online communities, and on-demand printing have also contributed. Independent designers can now find dedicated audiences. The Zenobia Award celebrates designers from marginalized groups who are creating historical games; recent winning games have centered on subjects including caste in India under colonialism, the functions of Machu Picchu, and an economic system used by Cherokee people in the sixteenth century. In 2019, Elizabeth Hargrave released Wingspan, a beautifully illustrated Euro-style game about birds; nearly two million copies are in print. Historically, she told me, most players and designers and publishers of games have been men; the industry is slowly escaping their grip. \u201cNot everybody enjoys killing monsters in dungeons,\u201d said Isaac Childres, the designer of Gloomhaven, which is about killing monsters in dungeons.\n\nJohn du Bois, a game designer whom Hollandspiele has published, met me and Amabel at the apartment of Amabel\u2019s girlfriend, Samhain Bones. (Bones, who named herself Samhain after the Halloween-adjacent pagan holiday when she transitioned a few years ago, had on a pink tank top that said \u201cBE GAY DO CRIME!\u201d and skeletal wrist warmers.) This gave us a foursome for sampling some modern games. We started with Amabel\u2019s Northern Pacific. The board shows a network of potential paths connecting cities. Players must build train tracks connecting Minneapolis to Seattle; on each turn, they can either place a cube on a city and hope that a train comes there, or place a train on a track segment. One tactic is to see where an opponent might direct her trains and place your own cubes to reap the rewards. \u201cIt\u2019s about leaving your opponents with the most bad choices,\u201d du Bois said.\n\nNext was Turncoats, from another publisher, Milda Matilda Games. A map contains eleven adjacent regions and a smattering of stones in three colors. Each player receives eight stones to hide in her hand; she can either place them on the map or take actions to alter their distribution in her hand or on the map. At the end of the game, the player who holds in her hand the color that has dominated the most regions on the map is the winner. The trick is to guide the board toward a certain color without depleting that color f"}}

The focus must be on this edgy stuff and not really on the contingency that led to the bottle episode (essentially we are not going for the survival/danger angle from the contingency at all and whatever reason you may choose for the bottle episode is simple a device or means to an end)\n\nI have the following problems while trying to generate a suitable explanation for how they all land up in this situation:\n\n1. Mrs. Miller has a family so exactly where are they in this \"lock-in\"\n2. What very realistic and plausible sequence of events caused this lock-in and where is it?\n3. What explains the presence of each of the characters at the same location at the same time that led to them all being together in this bottle episode? Even though they are neighbors I want a very well thought out and meticulously crafted extensive set of reasons leading to each of them being there and precipitating in this eventuality.\n4. Come up with and resolve any other important point along these lines that I need to consider and resolve in order to make things smooth, logical and very well built together (nothing must be unexplained or expect the audience to just go along with)...\n\n5. How is it that these three specific characters end up locked in with the striking Mrs. Miller? Shouldn't they all be elsewhere? If they are here what explains the absence of other neighbors and so on? How come all three happen to be here?\n\n"}}
