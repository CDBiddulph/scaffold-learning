Let $T_1, T_2, T_3$ be our tangents from the circle to the parallelogram. By the secant power of a point, the power of $A = 3 \\cdot (3+9) = 36$. Then $AT_2  = AT_3 = \\sqrt{36} = 6$. Similarly, the power of $C = 16 \\cdot (16+9) = 400$ and  $CT_1 = \\sqrt{400} = 20$. We let $BT_3 = BT_1 = x$ and label the diagram accordingly.\nNotice that because $BC = AD, 20+x = 6+DT_2 \\implies DT_2 = 14+x$. Let $O$ be the center of the circle. Since $OT_1$ and $OT_2$ intersect $BC$ and $AD$, respectively, at right angles, we have $T_2T_1CD$ is a right-angled trapezoid and more importantly, the diameter of the circle is the height of the triangle. Therefore, we can drop an altitude from $D$ to $BC$ and $C$ to $AD$, and both are equal to $2r$. Since $T_1E = T_2D$, $20 - CE = 14+x \\implies CE = 6-x$. Since $CE = DF, DF = 6-x$ and $AF = 6+14+x+6-x = 26$.

Similarly, $({AL})^2=3\\cdot{12} \\Longrightarrow AL=6$. Notice that $AL=AN=6$ since quadrilateral $LONA$ is symmetrical. Let $AC$ intersect $MN$ at $I$. Then, $\\bigtriangleup{IMC}$ is similar to $\\bigtriangleup{AIN}$. Therefore, $\\frac{CI}{MC}=\\frac{AI}{AN}$. Let the length of $PI=l$, then $\\frac{25-l}{20}=\\frac{3+l}{6}$.

Then, $\\bigtriangleup{ABR}$ is right with $AR=6-x$, $AB=6+x$, and $RB=2r_1=MN=6\\sqrt{3}$. Taking the difference of squares, we get $108=24x \\Longrightarrow x=\\frac{9}{2}$. The area of $ABCD$ is $MN\\cdot{BC}=(20+x)\\cdot{MN} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{49}{2}\\cdot{6\\sqrt{3}}=147\\sqrt{3}$.

Also, $H$ is the intersection of $XY$ (diameter) and $AC$ (diagonal). Then by power of a point with given info on $A$ and $C$ we get that $AY=6$ and $CX=20$. Note that $HAY \\sim HCX$, and since $\\frac{AY}{CX}=\\frac{3}{10}$ we note that \\[\\frac{AH}{CH} = \\frac{AP+PH}{CQ+QH} = \\frac{3+PH}{16+QH} =\\frac{AY}{CX}=\\frac{3}{10}\\]. Since $PH+HQ=9$, we get that $PH=\\frac{45}{13}$ and $QH=\\frac{72}{13}$. This is the length information within the circle.\nThe same triangle similarity also means that $\\frac{YH}{XH}=\\frac{3}{10}$, so if the radius of the circle is $r$ then we have $XH=\\frac{20}{13}r$ and $YH = \\frac{6}{13}r$. \nBy power of a point on H, we can figure out $r$:\n\\[XH\\cdot YH = PH \\cdot QG\\]\n\\[\\frac{20}{13}r \\cdot \\frac{6}{13}r = \\frac{45}{13} \\cdot \\frac{72}{13}\\]\nand we get that $r = 3 \\sqrt 3$.

Let's try it out for $n=3$. \nLet's perform casework on the number of elements in $A, B$. \n$\\textbf{Case 1:} |A| = |B| = 1$\nIn this case, the only possible equivalencies will be if they are the exact same element, which happens $3$ times.\n$\\textbf{Case 2:} |A| = |B| = 2$\nIn this case, if they share both elements, which happens $3$ times, we will get $2$ for each time, and if they share only one element, which also happens $6$ times, we will get $1$ for each time, for a total of $12$ for this case.\n$\\textbf{Case 3:} |A| = |B| = 3$\nIn this case, the only possible scenario is that they both are the set $\\{1,2,3\\}$, and we have $3$ for this case.\n\nIn total, $S_3 = 18$.\nNow notice, the number of intersections by each element $1 \\ldots 3$, or in general, $1 \\ldots n$ is equal for each element because of symmetry - each element when $n=3$ adds $6$ to the answer. Notice that $6 = \\binom{4}{2}$ - let's prove that $S_n = n \\cdot \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$ (note that you can assume this and answer the problem if you're running short on time in the real test).\nLet's analyze the element $k$ - to find a general solution, we must count the number of these subsets that $k$ appears in. For $k$ to be in both $A$ and $B$, we need both sets to contain $k$ and another subset of $1$ through $n$ not including $k$. ($A = \\{k\\} \\cup A'| A' \\subset \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\} \\land A' \\not \\subset \\{k\\}$ and \n$B = \\{k\\} \\cup B'| B' \\subset \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\} \\land B' \\not \\subset \\{k\\}$)\nFor any $0\\leq l \\leq n-1$ that is the size of both $A'$ and $B'$, the number of ways to choose the subsets $A'$ and $B'$ is $\\binom{n-1}{l}$ for both subsets, so the total number of ways to choose the subsets are $\\binom{n-1}{l}^2$.\nNow we sum this over all possible $l$'s to find the total number of ways to form sets $A$ and $B$ that contain $k$. This is equal to $\\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{l}^2$. This is a simplification of Vandermonde's identity, which states that $\\sum_{k=0}^{r} \\binom{m}{k} \\cdot \\binom{n}{r-k} = \\binom{m+n}{r}$. Here, $m$, $n$ and $r$ are all $n-1$, so this sum is equal to $\\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$. Finally, since we are iterating over all $k$'s for $n$ values of $k$, we have $S_n = n \\cdot \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$, proving our claim.\nWe now plug in $S_n$ to the expression we want to find. This turns out to be $\\frac{2022 \\cdot \\binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \\cdot \\binom{4040}{2020}}$. Expanding produces $\\frac{2022 \\cdot 4042!\\cdot 2020! \\cdot 2020!}{2021 \\cdot 4040! \\cdot 2021! \\cdot 2021!}$.\nAfter cancellation, we have \\[\\frac{2022 \\cdot 4042 \\cdot 4041}{2021 \\cdot 2021 \\cdot 2021} \\implies \\frac{4044\\cdot 4041}{2021 \\cdot 2021}\\]\n$4044$ and $4041$ don't have any common factors with $2021$, so we're done with the simplification. We want to find $4044 \\cdot 4041 + 2021^2 \\pmod{1000} \\equiv 44 \\cdot 41 + 21^2 \\pmod{1000} \\equiv 1804+441 \\pmod{1000} \\equiv 2245 \\pmod{1000} \\equiv \\boxed{245}$\n\n~KingRavi\n~Edited by MY-2\nWe take cases based on the number of values in each of the subsets in the pair. Suppose we have $k$ elements in each of the subsets in a pair (for a total of n elements in the set). The expected number of elements in any random pair will be $n \\cdot \\frac{k}{n} \\cdot \\frac{k}{n}$ by linearity of expectation because for each of the $n$ elements, there is a $\\frac{k}{n}$ probability that the element will be chosen. To find the sum over all such values, we multiply this quantity by  $\\binom{n}{k}^2$. Summing, we get \\[\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{k^2}{n} \\binom{n}{k}^2\\] Notice that we can rewrite this as \\[\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n} \\left(\\frac{k \\cdot n!}{(k)!(n - k)!}\\right)^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n} n^2 \\left(\\frac{(n-1)!}{(k - 1)!(n - k)!}\\right)^2 = n \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}^2 = n \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\\binom{n - 1}{n - k}\\] We can simplify this using Vandermonde's identity to get $n \\binom{2n - 2}{n - 1}$. Evaluating this for $2022$ and $2021$ gives \\[\\frac{2022\\binom{4042}{2021}}{2021\\binom{4040}{2020}} = \\frac{2022 \\cdot 4042 \\cdot 4041}{2021^3} = \\frac{2022 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4041}{2021^2}\\] Evaluating the numerators and denominators mod $1000$ gives $804 + 441 = 1\\boxed{245}$\n- pi_is_3.14\nFor each element $i$, denote $x_i = \\left( x_{i, A}, x_{i, B} \\right) \\in \\left\\{ 0 , 1 \\right\\}^2$, where $x_{i, A} = \\Bbb I \\left\\{ i \\in A \\right\\}$ (resp. $x_{i, B} = \\Bbb I \\left\\{ i \\in B \\right\\}$).\nDenote $\\Omega = \\left\\{ (x_1, \\cdots , x_n): \\sum_{i = 1}^n x_{i, A} = \\sum_{i = 1}^n x_{i, B} \\right\\}$.\nDenote $\\Omega_{-j} = \\left\\{ (x_1, \\cdots , x_{j-1} , x_{j+1} , \\cdots , x_n): \\sum_{i \\neq j} x_{i, A} = \\sum_{i \\neq j} x_{i, B} \\right\\}$.\nHence,\n\\begin{align*} S_n & = \\sum_{(x_1, \\cdots , x_n) \\in \\Omega} \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\Bbb I \\left\\{ x_{i, A} = x_{i, B} = 1 \\right\\} \\\\ & = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{(x_1, \\cdots , x_n) \\in \\Omega} \\Bbb I \\left\\{ x_{i, A} = x_{i, B} = 1 \\right\\} \\\\ & = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{(x_1, \\cdots , x_{i-1} , x_{i+1} , \\cdots , x_n) \\in \\Omega_{-i}} 1  \\\\ & = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\left( \\binom{n-1}{j} \\right)^2 \\\\ & = n \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\left( \\binom{n-1}{j} \\right)^2 \\\\ & = n \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{j} \\binom{n-1}{n-1-j} \\\\ & = n \\binom{2n-2}{n-1} . \\end{align*}\nTherefore,\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} & = \\frac{2022 \\binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \\binom{4040}{2020}} \\\\ & = \\frac{4044 \\cdot 4041}{2021^2} . \\end{align*}\nThis is in the lowest term.\nTherefore, modulo 1000,\n\\begin{align*} p + q  & \\equiv 4044 \\cdot 4041 + 2021^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 44 \\cdot 41 + 21^2 \\\\ & \\equiv \\boxed{\\textbf{(245) }} . \\end{align*}\n~Steven Chen (www.professorchenedu.com)\nLet's ask what the contribution of an element $k\\in \\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\}$ is to the sum $S_n = \\sum | A \\cap B |.$\nThe answer is given by the number of $(A,B)$ such that $|A|=|B|$ and $k \\in A\\cap B$, which is given by $\\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$\nby the following construction: Write down 1 to $n$ except $k$ in a row.

Hence, $p < q \\leq 3 p$.\nHence, Equation (1) can be written as\n\\[ q^2 + 3 p^2 = 146^2 . \\hspace{1cm} (2) \\]\nNow, we solve this equation.\nFirst, we find an upper bound of $q$.\nWe have $q^2 + 3 p^2 \\geq q^2 + 3 \\left( \\frac{q}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4 q^2}{3}$.\nHence, $\\frac{4 q^2}{3} \\leq 146^2$.\nHence, $q \\leq 73 \\sqrt{3} < 73 \\cdot 1.8 = 131.4$.\nBecause $q$ is an integer, we must have $q \\leq 131$.\nSecond, we find a lower bound of $q$.\nWe have $q^2 + 3 p^2 < q^2 + 3 q^2 = 4 q^2$.\nHence, $4 q^2 > 146^2$.\nHence, $q > 73$.\nBecause $q$ is an integer, we must have $q \\geq 74$.\nNow, we find the integer solutions of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy Equation (2) with $74 \\leq q \\leq 131$.\nFirst, modulo 9, \n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 4 - 3 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 4 \\mbox{ or } 1 . \\end{align*}\nHence $q \\equiv \\pm 1, \\pm 2 \\pmod{9}$.\nSecond, modulo 5, \n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 + 2 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 + 2 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } -1 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 3 \\mbox{ or } - 1 . \\end{align*}\nBecause $q^2 \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } - 1$, we must have $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } - 1$.\nHence, $5 \\nmid q$.\nThird, modulo 7,\n\\begin{align*} q^2 & \\equiv 146^2 - 3 p^2 \\\\ & \\equiv 1 - 3 \\cdot ( 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } 5 \\mbox{ or } 2 ) \\\\ & \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\mbox{ or } 3 \\mbox{ or } 5 . \\end{align*}\nBecause $q^2 \\equiv 0 \\mbox{ or } 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\mbox{ or } 4 \\pmod{ 7 }$, we must have $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nHence, $q \\equiv 1, 3, 4, 6 \\pmod{7}$.\nGiven all conditions above, the possible $q$ are 74, 83, 88, 92, 97, 101, 106, 109, 116, 118, 127.\nBy testing all these numbers, we find that the only solution is $q = 97$.\nThis implies $p = 63$.\nHence, $b = 3p = 189$ and $d = 3q = 291$.\nHence, $c = \\frac{d - b}{2} = 51$.\nTherefore, the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $b + c + a = 189 + 51 + 219 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(459) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (www.professorchenedu.com)\nWe wish to solve the Diophantine equation $a^2+ab+b^2=3^2 \\cdot 73^2$. It can be shown that $3|a$ and $3|b$, so we make the substitution $a=3x$ and $b=3y$ to obtain $x^2+xy+y^2=73^2$ as our new equation to solve for. \nNotice that $r^2+r+1=(r-\\omega)(r-{\\omega}^2)$, where $\\omega=e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$. Thus,\n\\[x^2+xy+y^2 = y^2((x/y)^2+(x/y)+1) = y^2 (\\frac{x}{y}-\\omega)(\\frac{x}{y}-{\\omega}^2) = (x-y\\omega)(x-y{\\omega}^2).\\]\nNote that $8^2+1^2+8 \\cdot 1=73$. Thus, $(8-\\omega)(8-{\\omega}^2)=73$. Squaring both sides yields \n\\begin{align} (8-\\omega)^2(8-{\\omega}^2)^2&=73^2\\\\ (63-17\\omega)(63-17{\\omega}^2)&=73^2. \\end{align}\nThus, by $(2)$, $(63, 17)$ is a solution to $x^2+xy+y^2=73^2$.

Therefore, triangles $APD$, $APZ$, $DPW$ and $PZW$ are all right triangles. By SAA congruence, the first three triangles are congruent; by SAS congruence, $\\triangle PZW$ is congruent to the other three. Therefore, $AD = DW = WZ = AZ$, so $AZWD$ is a rhombus. By symmetry, $BYXC$ is also a rhombus.\nExtend line $PQ$ to meet $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $R$ and $S$, respectively. Because of rhombus properties, $RP = QS = \\frac{333}{2}$. Also, by rhombus properties, $R$ and $S$ are the midpoints of segments $AD$ and $BC$, respectively; therefore, by trapezoid properties, $RS = \\frac{AB + CD}{2} = 575$.

Side $AB$ is parallel to side $CD$, so $XYWZ$ is a rectangle with width $PQ$. Furthermore, because $CD - AB = 650-500 = 150$ and trapezoid $ABCD$ is isosceles, $WC - YB = ZD - XA = 75$. \nAlso because $ABCD$ is isosceles, $\\angle ABC + \\angle BCD$ is half the total sum of angles in $ABCD$, or $180^{\\circ}$. Since $BQ$ and $CQ$ bisect $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle BCD$, respectively, we have $\\angle QBC + \\angle QCB = 90^{\\circ}$, so $\\angle BQC = 90^{\\circ}$. \nLetting $BQ = 333k$, applying Pythagoras to $\\triangle BQC$ yields $QC = 333\\sqrt{1-k^2}$. We then proceed using similar triangles: $\\angle BYQ = \\angle BQC = 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle YBQ = \\angle QBC$, so by AA similarity $YB = 333k^2$. Likewise, $\\angle CWQ = \\angle BQC = 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle WCQ = \\angle QCB$, so by AA similarity $WC = 333(1 - k^2)$. Thus $WC + YB = 333$.\nAdding our two equations for $WC$ and $YB$ gives $2WC = 75 + 333 = 408$. Therefore, the answer is $PQ = ZW = CD - 2WC = 650 - 408 = \\boxed{242}$.\n~Orange_Quail_9\nThis will be my first solution on AoPS. My apologies in advance for any errors. \nAngle bisectors can be thought of as the locus of all points equidistant from the lines whose angle they bisect. It can thus be seen that $P$ is equidistant from  $AB, AD,$ and $CD$ and $Q$ is equidistant from  $AB, BC,$ and $CD.$ If we let the feet of the altitudes from $P$ to $AB, AD,$ and $CD$ be called $E, F,$ and $G$ respectively, we can say that $PE = PF = PG.$ Analogously, we let the feet of the altitudes from $Q$ to $AB, BC,$ and $CD$ be $H, I,$ and $J$ respectively. Thus, $QH = QI = QJ.$ Because $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid, we can say that all of the altitudes are equal to each other. \nBy SA as well as SS congruence for right triangles, we find that triangles $AEP, AFP, BHQ,$ and $BIQ$ are congruent.

Suppose that Melanie travels a distance of $a$ in the $x$-direction and a distance of $c$ in the $y$-direction in one minute when there is no current. Similarly, suppose that Sherry travels a distance of $a$ in the $x$-direction but a distance of $b$ in the $y$-direction in one minute when there is no current. The current only affects the $x$-components because it goes in the $x$-direction. \n\nNow, note that $a^2 + b^2 = 60^2$ because Sherry travels 60 meters in a minute. Thus, $a^2 + c^2 = 80^2$ because Melanie travels 80 meters in a minute. Also, the distance they travel with the current must be the same in one minute because they reach the point equidistant from them at the same time. That means $b + 14 = c - 14$ or $b = c - 28$. So now we can plug that into the two equations to get:\n\\begin{align*} a^2 + c^2 &= 80^2, \\\\ a^2 + (c-28)^2 &= 60^2. \\end{align*}\nWe can solve the system of equations to get $a = 48$ and $c = 64$. From this, we can figure out that it must've taken them $5.5$ minutes to get to the other side, because $264/48 = 5.5$. This means that there are $5.5$ lengths of $48$ in each person's travel. Also, $D$ must be equal to $11(b+14) = 11(c-14)$ because there are $(5.5)2 = 11$ lengths of $b-14$ between them, $5.5$ on each person's side. Since $c = 64$, we have $c-14 = 50$, so the answer is \\[D=11\\cdot50=\\boxed{550}.\\]\n~Curious_crow"}}

Similarly, sequences with {30,40} and {40,50} will not give us any subtractions because those sequences must all include a 20. Let's stick with the lower ones for a minute: if we take them two at a time, then {3,5} will give us the subtraction of 1 sequence {3,5,7,9}. We have exhausted all pairs of numbers we can take, and if we take the triplet of single digit numbers, the only possible sequence must have a 6, which we already don't count. Therefore, we subtract $\\textbf{1}$ from the count of illegal sequences with any of the single-digit numbers and none of the numbers 30,40,50.\n(Note if we take only 1 at a time, there will have to be 3 of $a, b$, which is impossible.)\nIf we have the sequence including {30,50}, we end up having negative values, so these do not give us any subtractions, and the triplet {30,40,50} gives us a 20. Hence by the same reasoning as earlier, we have 0 subtractions from the sequences with these numbers and none of the single digit numbers {3,4,5}.\nFinally, we count the sequences that are something like (one of 3,4,5,), $a, b$, (one of 30, 40, 50). If this is to be the case, then let $a$ be the starting value in the sequence. The sequence will be $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$; We see that if we subtract the largest term by the smallest term we have $3d$, so the subtraction of one of (30,40,50) and one of (3,4,5) must be divisible by 3. Therefore the only sequences possible are $3,a,b,30; 4,a,b,40; 5,a,b,50$. Of these, only the last is invalid because it gives $b = 35$, larger than our bounds $6<a<b<30$.

We can use inradius or equilateral triangle properties to get the inradius of this triangle is $12$ (The incenter is also a centroid in an equilateral triangle, and the distance from a side to the centroid is a third of the height). Therefore, the radius of each of the smaller circles is $12$.\nLet $O=\\omega$ be the center of the largest circle. We will set up a coordinate system with $O$ as the origin. The center of $\\omega_A$ will be at $(0,-6)$ because it is directly beneath $O$ and is the length of the larger radius minus the smaller radius, or $18-12 = 6$. By rotating this point $120^{\\circ}$ around $O$, we get the center of $\\omega_B$. This means that the magnitude of vector $\\overrightarrow{O\\omega_B}$ is $6$ and is at a $30$ degree angle from the horizontal. Therefore, the coordinates of this point are $(3\\sqrt{3},3)$ and by symmetry the coordinates of the center of $\\omega_C$ is $(-3\\sqrt{3},3)$.\nThe upper left and right circles intersect at two points, the lower of which is $X$. The equations of these two circles are:\n\\begin{align*} (x+3\\sqrt3)^2 + (y-3)^2 &= 12^2, \\\\ (x-3\\sqrt3)^2 + (y-3)^2 &= 12^2. \\end{align*}\nWe solve this system by subtracting to get $x = 0$.

Since we know $X$ is the lower solution, we take the negative value to get $X = (0,3-\\sqrt{117})$.\nWe can solve the problem two ways from here. We can find $Y$ by rotation and use the distance formula to find the length, or we can be somewhat more clever. We notice that it is easier to find $OX$ as they lie on the same vertical, $\\angle XOY$ is $120$ degrees so we can make use of $30-60-90$ triangles, and $OX = OY$ because $O$ is the center of triangle $XYZ$.

So, we get $2R-r = 2r$ and $r = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot R = 12$.\nSince $\\odot \\omega$ and $\\odot \\omega_A$ are tangent, we get $\\omega \\omega_A = R - r = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot R = 6$.\nNote that $\\triangle \\omega_A \\omega_B \\omega_C$ is an equilateral triangle, and $\\omega$ is its center, so $\\omega_B \\omega_C = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\omega \\omega_A = 6 \\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\textbf{Step 2:}$\nNote that $\\triangle \\omega_C E X$ is an isosceles triangle, so \\[EX = 2 \\sqrt{(\\omega_C E)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega_B \\omega_C}{2}\\right)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega_B \\omega_C}{2}\\right)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{12^2 - (3 \\sqrt{3})^2} = 2 \\sqrt{117}.\\]\n$\\textbf{Step 3:}$\nIn $\\odot \\omega_C$, Power of a Point gives $\\omega X \\cdot \\omega E = r^2 - (\\omega_C \\omega)^2$ and $\\omega E = EX - \\omega X = 2\\sqrt{117} - \\omega X$.\nIt follows that $\\omega X \\cdot (2\\sqrt{117} - \\omega X) = 12^2 - 6^2$.

Since all five vertices are on the sphere, the distances of the spherical center and the vertices are the same: $l$. Because of the symmetrical property of the pyramid,\nwe can imagine that the line of the apex and the (sphere's) center will intersect the square at the (base's) center.\nSince the volume is $54 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot S \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 6^2 \\cdot h$, where $h=\\frac{9}{2}$ is the height of this pyramid, we have: $l^2=\\left(\\frac{9}{2}-l\\right)^2+\\left(3\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2$ according to the Pythagorean theorem.\nSolve this equation will give us $l = \\frac{17}{4},$ therefore $m+n=\\boxed{021}.$\nTo start, we find the height of the pyramid.

Then, the vertices of the base would be $(3,3,0), (3,-3,0), (-3,3,0), (-3,-3,0)$ in some order. Also, let the vertex be  $(0,0,\\frac{9}{2})$. Recall that the formula for a sphere is $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2+(z-c)^2=r^2$ where the center is $(a,b,c)$ and the radius is $r$. Symmetry gives that $a=b=0$. Plug in $(3,3,0)$ and $(0,0,\\frac{9}{2})$ and you get the system of equation \n$18+c^2=r^2$\n$(\\frac{9}{2}-c)^2=r^2$\nSolving gives $c=1/4$ and $r=17/4$, so our answer is $17+4=\\boxed{021}$.~[Ddk001](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Ddk001)"}}

We can therefore simplify the problem by finding all such numbers described above between $1$ and $60$ and multiplying the quantity of such numbers by $10$ ($600$/$60$ = $10$).\nAfter making a simple list of the numbers between $1$ and $60$ and going through it, we see that the numbers meeting this condition are $4$, $5$, $15$, $24$, $35$, $44$, $54$, and $55$.

This new point, call it #m, when connected to point #1 on $\\ell_B$, crosses $m*(n-1)$ lines, thus making additional $m*(n-1)+1$ bounded regions; when connected to point #2 on $\\ell_B$, it crosses $m*(n-2)$ lines, thus making additional $m*(n-2)+1$ bounded regions; etc. By simple algebra/recursion methods, we see\n$f(m+1, n)-f(m, n)=m*\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} +n$\nNotice $f(1,n)=n-1$. Not very difficult to figure out:\n$f(m, n)=\\frac{m(m-1)n(n-1)}{4} +mn-1$\nThe fact that $f(3,2)=8$ makes us more confident about the formula. Now plug in $m=5, n=7$, we get the final answer of $\\boxed{244}$.\n[AIME 2022 II 9-min.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:AIME_2022_II_9-min.png)\nLet some number of segments be constructed. We construct a new segment. We start from the straight line $l_B.$ WLOG from point $B_3.$  Segment will cross several existing segments (points $A,B,C,...$) and enter one of the points of the line  $l_A (A_1).$\nEach of these points adds exactly  1 new bounded region (yellow bounded regions). \nThe exception is the only first segment $(A_1 B_1),$ which does not create any bounded region. \nThus, the number of bounded regions is $1$ less than the number of points of intersection of the segments plus the number of points of arrival of the segments to $l_A.$\nEach point of intersection of two segments is determined  uniquely by the choice of pairs of points on each line. \nThe number of such pairs is $\\dbinom{n}{2} \\cdot \\dbinom{m}{2}.$\nExactly one segment comes to each of the $n$ points of the line $l_A$ from each of the $m$ points of the line $l_B.$ The total number of arrivals is equal to $mn.$\nHence, the total number of bounded regions is $N = \\dbinom{n}{2} \\cdot \\dbinom{m}{2} + mn \u2013 1.$\nWe plug in $m=5, n=7$, we get the final answer of $\\boxed{244}$.\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\nWhen a new point is added to a line, the number of newly bounded regions it creates with each line segment will be one more than the number of intersection points the line makes with other lines.\nCase 1: If a new point $P$ is added to the right on a line when both lines have an equal amount of points.\nWLOG, let the point be on line $\\ell_A$. We consider the complement, where new lines don't intersect other line segments. Simply observing, we see that the only line segments that don't intersect with the new lines are lines attached to some point that a new line does not pass through. If we look at a series of points on line $\\ell_B$ from left to right and a line connects $P$ to an arbitrary point, then the lines formed with that point and with remaining points on the left of that point never intersect with the line with $P$. Let there be $s$ points on lines $\\ell_A$ and $\\ell_B$ before $P$ was added. For each of the $s$ points on $\\ell_B$, we subtract the total number of lines formed, which is $s^2$, not counting $P$. Considering all possible points on $\\ell_B$, we get $(s^2-s)+(s^2-2s)\\cdots(s^2-s^2)$ total intersections. However, for each of the lines, there is one more bounded region than number of intersections, so we add $s$. Simplifying, we get $s^3-s\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{i}+s\\Longrightarrow s(s^2-\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{i}+1)$. Note that this is only a recursion formula to find the number of new regions added for a new point $P$ added to $\\ell_A$.\nCase 2:  If a new point $P$ is added to the right of a line that has one less point than the other line.\nContinuing on case one, let this point $P$ be on line $\\ell_B$. With similar reasoning, we see that the idea remains the same, except $s+1$ lines are formed with $P$ instead of just $s$ lines. Once again, each line from $P$ to a point on line $\\ell_A$ creates $s$ non-intersecting lines for that point and each point to its left. Subtracting from $s(s+1)$ lines and considering all possible lines created by $P$, we get $(s(s+1)-s)+(s(s+1)-2s)\\cdots(s(s+1)-s(s+1)$ intersections. However, the number of newly bounded regions is the number of intersections plus the number of points on line $\\ell_A$. Simplying, we get $s(s+1)^2-s\\sum_{i=1}^{s+1}{i}+(s+1)$ newly bounded regions.\nFor the base case $s=2$ for both lines, there are $4$ bounded regions. Next, we plug in $s=2,3,4$ for both formulas and plug $s=5$ for the first formula to find the number of regions when $m=6$ and $n=5$. Notice that adding a final point on $\\ell_A$ is a variation of our Case 1. The only difference is for each of the $s$ lines formed by $P$, there are $s+1$ points that can form a non-intersecting line. Therefore, we are subtracting a factor of $s+1$ lines instead of $s$ lines from a total of $s(s+1)$ lines. However, the number of lines formed by $P$ remains the same so we still add $s$ at the end when considering intersection points. Thus, the recursive equation becomes $(s(s+1)-(s+1))+(s(s+1)-2(s+1))\\cdots(s(s+1)-s(s+1))+s\\Longrightarrow s^2(s+1)-(s+1)\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{i}+s$. Plugging $s=5$ into this formula and adding the values we obtained from the other formulas, the final answer is $4+4+9+12+22+28+45+55+65=\\boxed{244}$.\n~[Magnetoninja](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Magnetoninja)\nWe know the by Euler's Formula for planar graphs that $F-E+V=2$, where $F$ is the number of bounded faces, plus the outer region, $E$ is the number of edges, and $V$ is the number of vertices. Temporarily disregarding the intersections between the lines, we can easily calculate that:\n$V_{i}=7+5=12$\n$E_{i}=6+4+7\\cdot5=45$\nHowever, the resulting graph is not planar, as the edges clearly intersect. To account for this, we must turn all intersection points into vertices, and update our values accordingly.\nObserve that each intersection point can be mapped to two points on either line, and analogously, two points on either line can be mapped to one intersection point, uniquely. Thus, to count intersection points, we simply calculate:\n${7 \\choose 2}{5 \\choose 2} = 210$\nAnd thus,\n$V=V_{i}+210=222$\nWe must also account for the edges. Observe that each intersection point turns the two edges that make it into four, that is, each intersection point adds $2$ to the number of edges. Therefore,\n$E=E_{i}+2\\cdot210=465$\nPlugging these into Euler's Formula we get:\n$F-E+V=2$\n$F-465+222=2$\n$F=245$\nDisregarding the outer region, we conclude that our answer is $F-1=245-1=\\boxed {244}$\n~[Shadowleafy](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Shadowleafy)"}}
