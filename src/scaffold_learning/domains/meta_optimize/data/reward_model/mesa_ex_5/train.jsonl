Social media algorithms often amplify posts that attract attention, causing users to spend more time on the app and rake in more advertisement profits for the social media company. This has proven to be a blessing to fake news, as more people respond more to sensationalised content, even if it is inaccurate, resulting in an ever-incrasing  amount of views on the post in question. According to a study, fake news spreads 7 times as fast as factual news. This highlights the speed at which fake news travels, and this will cause harm to the society at large.\"}, {\"input\": \"What is the best way to travel from Tel-Aviv to Jerusalem? Car? Bus?

This makes the standard plan absolutely unattractive even for non-tech-savvy professionals. But the professional plan also only offers 700 searches for $10.\\nPersonally, I think Kagi needs to reconsider their pricing plans and either lower the monthly price or significantly raise the limit for included searches.

The time has come when it i s not only\\ndesirable but neces sary to attempt something of thi s\\nsort ; for in the course of their labours the educa\\ntional, medical, and social psychologi st s have ac\\ncumulated a mas s of data revealing unsuspected\\ndefect s, and hinting at marvellous pos sibilitie s, in\\nthe upbringing of the young.\\nOn the on e hand, they have shown that not enough\\nheed has been paid to the hampering influences of\\nan unfavourable environment and physical malad\\nj ustment ; and, on the other hand, they have made i t\\nclear that, by instituting certain reforms, it is en\\ntirely feasible to develop mental and moral vigour in\\nthe mas s of mankind to an astonishing degree. My\\nVii\\nPREFACE\\nown belief, indeed, for reasons set forth in subsequent\\npages, is that the di scoveri es of the modern psychol\\nogists j ustify the as sertion that, through proper\\ntraining in childhood, it i s pos sible to create a race\\nof men and women far superior morally to the gener\\nalty of the world\\u2019s inhabitants to-day, and manifest~\\ning intellectual powers of a far higher order than\\nthe generalty now display.\\nWhether thi s beli ef will ever be vindicated\\nwhether, for the matter of that, the di scoveries of\\nrecent psychological research will prove of any real\\nvalue \\u2014 depends, of course, on the extent to which\\npractical application is made by those having charge\\nof the young, and particularly by parents. For the\\nfact most surely establi shed by the s cientific investi\\ngators is that it is in the firs t years of life, and in\\nthe influences of the home, that the forces are set in\\nmotion which count for most in the makin g or mar\\nring of the individual\\u2019s character and career.

Be as critical as you can and thorough as well. Continue the message where (...) is present and be highly involved with solving the problem with having Regulars get involved with High-Rankers (godlike opposition) way too seamlessly by SIU's writing.\\n</format>\\n\\n<text> In season 1, there were multiple, interesting narratives being explored by an interesting, dynamic cast. Baam was mostly the protagonist, but other stories and characters were able to coexist comfortably alongside Baam.\\n\\nIn season 2, the narratives of Baam's party are greatly much less explored. They still had decent roles here and there, such as in the Workshop Battle, trying to deal with Viole/Bam throughout the tournament. But starting with the extensive Hell Train journey, it becomes mostly about Baam, while the people around him\\u2014his sidekicks, his companions\\u2014they take a noticeable backseat regarding their role within the story.\\n\\nIn season 3, the story has been fully utilizing Baam as the sole dominant main character, with the other past characters being further less maintenanced.\\n\\nThis maintenance problem compounds itself because SIU keeps avoiding giving meaningful depth to the established recognized character cast and has kept on creating brand-new characters with brand-new storylines (that are not connected to any notable supporting character in any way). He is clearly not being efficient with the way he manages established characters. \\n\\nThe escalation of power feels too quick as well as too sudden since Season 3 began. We are having the greatest conflicts in the history of the Tower right after Baam just finished boarding the Hell Train (a system revolving around D-ranked Regulars climbing the Tower quicker).\\n\\nThe story quickly escalated from Baam fighting top D-class Regulars, to Baam fighting Rankers, Advanced Rankers, High Rankers, and now some of the best High Rankers in the Tower.\\n\\nAccording to the timeline in the story, the total power growth of Baam since beating Kaiser has all happened in 2\\u20133 Tower years. The main conflict involving Baam has essentially evolved from D-Ranked Regular fights, to Great Family Ranker Princesses, Zahard military commanders, and Great Family Head conflicts.\\n\\nThis sort of story content does not seem fitting right after climbing a couple of D-ranked floors and resolving a couple of Regular-orientated conflicts. Instead, it would have fit better putting these sorts of story content near the end of Baam's climb where he's almost a Ranker or after Baam becomes a Ranker himself. None of the main supporting cast following alongside the protagonist (Baam) is nowhere prepared or nowhere useful enough to be a part of a story featuring Rankers, major Great Family wars, and Zahard force conflicts.\\n\\nRight now in this current story arc, it feels like lv 30 players (Khun/Rak/Endorsi/+others) participating in main event quests featuring player lvs 300-10,000 (Rankers\\u2014High-Rankers). So because they so weak\\u2014they lack agency, a role, and a way to be relevant, which then leads to SIU progressing their character level in an over-the-top way.\\n\\nSIU messed up on is making our main cast TOO weak and everybody else TOO strong. Like, first we saw that even lower end rankers could effortlessly wipe multiple regulars and even Baam. Then we saw that these very same rankers are nothing for high rankers who are beasts on another level.\\n\\nIndeed, the rules SIU established regarding Regulars were limitations to his own work. There was no need to make it so challenging having the main ensemble cast struggle to fit alongside the protagonist of this series. SIU's intentions weren't to avoid characters like Khun or Rak because of Bam becoming more powerful with unlimited potential. Every major storyline has involved Tower-climbing Regulars one way or another, and that won't change into this core Tower-climbing group of Regulars become Rankers themselves.\\n\\nSIU should have started making characters like Rak and Khun much more powerful years ago, so it doesn't come so abrupt nowadays. Whether from finding means such as Bam giving his blood to his friends\\u2014like how Zahard gives away his blood to create Princesses\\u2014to Bam being able to create contracts with his friends to enhance their abilities beyond standard floor contracts. A way for Bam to directly empower his companions through a reliable, consistent system of progression beats relying on convoluted luck or absurd circumstances way too often.\\n\\nAs an Irregular, Bam has the potential to bend, overcome, or change the rules of the Tower; which he can use to his advantage so that he can strengthen his friends beyond their standard limitations. For example, we have seen Hell Joe greatly empower his allies with the usage of the Red Thryssa. Baam, with his unlimited potential as an Irregular, will eventually grow much more control over the Red Thryssa than Hell Joe ever had over time and be able to do the same boosting abilities for his own companions.\\n\\nThe more Baam grows in power, the better control he will have over the abilities and powers of the Red Thryssa. And since the Red Thryssa used to be a part of an Administrator, he could possibly develop abilities similar to a Guardian's abilities, such as the Guardian's ability to form contracts with other beings. And through this way, Bam would have another avenue to empower his allies and friends\\u2014through utilizing personal contracts with himself and the consumed thryssa within him as the main medium for contract formation.\\n\\nThese contracts would enhance their abilities and allow them to surpass the limitations imposed by the standard Administrator's contract, while also boosting their capabilities in a scaled and controlled manner over long periods of time. Natural progression for Regulars was never going to last in a story featuring an Irregular. But SIU should have been making efficient use of the protagonist being an Irregular who disrupts the established rules of the Tower to help his companions progress much quicker in the story.\\n\\n\\nSIU has said ages ago how he structures Khun and Rak as the core teammates around Bam to form a main-series trio. The other regular teammates will periodically return to Bam's team, leave, and return again from story arc to story arc as said and demonstrated by SIU.\\n\\nWhy else did Rak and Khun receive some of the strongest powers in history as Regulars so easily? So that SIU can keep scaling them just enough to keep adventuring alongside Bam.\\n\\nFirst, it starts with Khun receiving Yeon family superpowers with no side effects (Maybe the power of the flame will emotionally and mentally affect him once Maria gets involved in the storyline at some point). Because of this acquired superpower, Khun can survive a lethal attack from a notable Ranker as well as even support Rankers through this power's abilities at no cost. Rak then obtained an extremely rare weapon just as randomly, involving just some chance encounters. This ancient spear can only be properly usable without repercussions by those relating to ancient lineage, and Rak just so happens to remarkably be related and around the area to receive such a weapon. Now with this weapon, Rak can compete and even kill Rankers.\\n\\nAlbelda once said how consuming so many souls would normally destroy a Regular's body and mind. The exceptions stated were Hoaqin, because of his spell mastery over souls and Bam because he has the capacity to consume anything. The quantity of souls Rak and Khun received were not only vastly greater, but the quality of the souls were also immensely superior to what Bam received previously from Albelda. Again, they reclaimed some absurd powers, but this time the powers obtained were even more inexplicable\\u2014not only were they completely unharmed by absorbing the soul essences of Rankers far exceeding their limits, but they instantly gained the ability to fly through raw Shinsoo usage (extremely difficult up to impossible for Regulars) and strength allowing them to compete or defeat Rankers as C-Ranked Regulars. These are feats and capabilities unprecedented for any Regular at Khun and Rak's stage, and normally accessible to only the strongest beings in the Tower.\\n\\nSevere repercussions as well as any drawbacks or damages to their physical and mental states were all avoided by SIU to help streamline Rak and Khun's growth in a way that allows them to continue supporting and being involved around Bam's story\\u2014since Season 1. Absolving the consequences of such immense and unnatural power accretion was SIU's deliberate approach to provide contrived circumstances and situations that allowed Khun and Rak to gain disproportionate, ridiculous powers while also maintaining and refining the established trio hierarchy that SIU wants.\\n\\n\\nDespite the extremely abrupt power escalation of the story's antagonists and conflicts since the beginning of Season 3, SIU will make sure to have Khun and Rak remain relevant in one way or another. That goes for other Regulars too, depending on SIU's plans with those Regulars. Every major storyline has involved (and will continue to involve) Regulars into these Regulars advance to become Rankers themselves at some point later in the series timeline. Bam is fighting for the sake of the people he cares about, and since the people closest around him are mostly Regulars, he will be around those types of people regardless of his status being an Irregular or a powerful deity. \\n\\n\\nSIU has said ages ago how he structures Khun and Rak as the core teammates around Bam to form a main-series trio.

In 1927, he made false eyelashes for actress Phyllis Haver, who played the role of Roxy in the famous musical \\\"Chicago\\\". The eyelashes were made of fringe and attached to a string, which was glued to the eyelid of the actress. \\n\\nIn life, such eyelashes looked not natural and held not long, but in the film industry made a real sensation. At that time made silent black-and-white movies, and in the frame false eyelashes looked amazing. \\n\\nAfter this invention of Max Factor false eyelashes began to be used everywhere in the movie industry, and all the famous actresses appeared in the frame with fringe eyelashes. For example, Sophia Loren made fluffy and long eyelashes a must-have makeup attribute.\\n\\nToward 1950, the technology of false eyelashes changed and now they were made of plastic. They still could afford only socialite divas, but over time the technology became cheaper and false eyelashes became available to ordinary women.\\n\\nIn the late nineties - early noughties in Japan abandoned false eyelashes and created the technology of eyelash extensions in bundles. Such eyelashes looked much more natural than false eyelashes. This was especially important for Japanese girls, because they have naturally very short eyelashes - only four millimeters. For comparison, Slavic girls have an average of eight to ten millimeters of eyelashes. \\n\\n\\nAnd in 2003, Japanese stylist and makeup artist Shu Uemura invented the technology of piece-by-piece eyelash extensions, eyelash to eyelash. This is how the classic Japanese technique of eyelash extensions appeared. The first model on whom he tried his extension technique was Madonna. These eyelashes were decorated with diamonds and sold then for ten thousand dollars at auction. \\n\\nAfter that, Shu Uemura's technology gained popularity and spread around the world. This technology became the basis for modern extension techniques.\\n\\nThus, the procedure of eyelash extensions is only 11 years old, and not even a hundred years have passed since the invention of false eyelashes. \\n\\nMy name is Anastasia Fox, here I tell you how to lashmaker to develop and grow in income in the new year.

But not just that, keeping a list of all your achievements is also very good for yourself and your motivation!\\n4. Let\\u2019s get more into the \\u201cwhy\\u201d next.\\n\\n5. Why keeping a brag list of wins is such a great idea?\\n\\n6. No matter if you are an engineer or a manager, this is what you should be doing.\\n7. There are two very important aspects of \\u201cwhy\\u201d you should do that.\\n\\n8. You will be able to present your results and achievements much better\\nWhen the time comes to talk about the promotion, you have all of the reasons to be promoted within your notes.\\n9. Have you successfully onboarded a new engineer?\\n10. You are mentoring others?\\n11. You played a key role in the project.\\n12. Definitely note all of this down!\\n\\n13. Also when anytime someone asks you about your achievements, you have all of the achievements noted down.\\n14. That ensures you are prepared for any situation!\\n15. A meeting with your manager, your peer, an interview for another role or speaking with a client/customer.\\n16. You are ready.\\n\\n17. Your personal motivation and sense of success will increase\\nImposter syndrome is unfortunately quite common in our industry and keeping a list of the wins that you have achieved is a great way to battle against that.\\n18. It reminds you how far you have come and that you deserve to be here.\\n\\n19. Also whenever you have a bad day, it\\u2019s a good reminder that a bad day doesn\\u2019t mean a bad month/year.\\n20. We all have ups and downs.\\n21. Let\\u2019s make sure that the \\u201cdowns\\u201d don\\u2019t get to us and that we are still moving in the right direction!\\n\\n22. If only I would have known this at the start of my career\\nAs I mentioned in some of my articles before, I am a self-taught engineer and at the beginning of my career I thought that people from university have this amazing programming skills and that I would never be able to get to their level.\\n\\n23. I was focusing too much on what I \\u201cmight not\\u201d achieve instead of what I have achieved.\\n\\n24. I was learning for whole days and enjoyed it.\\n25. Which helped me to progress very fast \\u2192 that\\u2019s actually what I should be focusing on.\\n26. Focusing on what you achieved and where you wish to go is the way to go.\\n27. Comparing and trying to \\u201ccompete\\u201d with others is not.\\n\\n28. You can read my story of how I started my career and how I progressed + top 3 learnings here: Starting my career again as a junior engineer.\\n\\n29. I would progress faster in my career if I would be doing this\\nAs I grew as an engineer and especially when I reached the senior level, I found myself in a strange time where I didn\\u2019t know exactly what is the next step for me.\\n30. And again, I wasn\\u2019t noting down all of the wins that I achieved, instead, I focused on not knowing what is the next step going to be.\\n\\n31. And little did I know, the next step for me was right there clearly visible in my wins!\\n32. What was clear to me is that I am good at collaborating and communicating + managing expectations especially when it comes to projects and functionalities.\\n\\n33. That was also the reason why I thought that management was the right path for me.\\n34. It turned out that I was right!\\n\\n35. You can read my story of how I progressed from IC to manager here: From IC to manager.\\n\\n36. \\ud83c\\udf81 Notion Template: List of Achievements\\nUse this template to note down all of your achievements.\\n37. This will ensure that you are ready if someone asks you and that you stay motivated!\\n\\n38.

The goals can be based on a year, month or also a week, it\\u2019s up to you.\\n40. My preference is yearly.\\n41. Here is an example of goals for a Software Engineer (from the template).\\n\\n42. Whenever you make a certain achievement, make sure to note it down in the List of Achievements.\\n43. This will ensure that nothing gets lost and you are prepared to talk about your achievements anytime!\\n\\n44. This is also my personal template that I use to note down all of the wins that I achieve.\\n\\n45. Here is what others are saying\\nKeeping track of my wins, and quantifying them in a way that shows my impact to not only engineering, but also business, product, and sales \\u2013 has been one of the best things I\\u2019ve ever done for myself.\\n46. It\\u2019s paid off massively in interviewing, promotion conversations, personal growth, seeing my own wins, focusing on where I can have the highest impact, etc.\\n\\u2014 Caleb Mellas, Senior Software Engineer / Tech Lead and Author of Level up software engineering \\ud83d\\ude80\\n\\n47. I've started doing this and it's changed my mindset.\\n48. And that's not even counting the concrete outcome of having all the facts and figures down.\\n\\n49. \\u2014 John Gallagher, Senior Software Engineer and Programming Coach\\nOne of the most most important question I ask in my 1-1 is: What are your wins over the since we last talked, and how do we celebrate them?\\n\\u2014\\n50. Tehn Yit Chin, Software Development Team Lead\\nRecording both big and small wins as a software engineer is important.\\n51. It helps you stay motivated, especially during challenging times in your software engineering journey.\\n\\u2014 Desmond Nzubechukwu, Software Engineer and Author of Inside Web Development\\nIn my opinion, writing down our victories and successes allows us to have a greater awareness of ourselves, our abilities and strengths.\\n52. Such a list is very useful on those days when it seems like everything is going wrong!\\n\\u2014 Gabriele Marini, CTO\\nLast words\\nNo matter your title or your role, this is what you should be doing.\\n53.

Consider, for example, what happens when you try to print n3 (type long) using the\\n%e specifier. First, the %e specifier causes printf() to expect a type double value, which is an 8-\\nbyte value on this system. When printf() looks at n3, which is a 4-byte value on this system, it\\nalso looks at the adjacent 4 bytes. Therefore, it looks at an 8-byte unit in which the actual n3 is\\nembedded.  Second, it interprets the bits in this unit as a floating-point number.  Some bits, for\\nexample, would be interpreted as an exponent. So even if n3 had the correct number of bits, they\\nwould be interpreted differently under %e than under %ld. The net result is nonsense.\\nThe first line also illustrates what we mentioned earlier\\u2014that float is converted to double\\nwhen used as arguments to printf(). On this system, float is 4 bytes, but n1 was expanded to 8\\nbytes so that printf() would display it correctly.\\nThe  second  line  of  output  shows  that printf()  can  print n3  and n4 correctly if the correct\\nspecifier is used.\\nThe third line of output shows that even the correct specifier can produce phony results if the\\nprintf() statement has mismatches elsewhere. As you might expect, trying to print a floating-\\npoint value with an %ld specifier fails, but here, trying to print a type long using %ld fails! The\\nproblem  lies  in  how  C  passes  information  to  a  function.  The  exact  details  of  this  failure  are\\nimplementation dependent, but the sidebar \\u201cPassing Arguments\\u201d discusses a representative system.\\n \\nPassing Arguments\\nThe  mechanics  of  argument  passing  depend  on  the  implementation.  This  is  how  argument\\npassing works on one system. The function call looks as follows:\\nClick here to view code image\\nprintf(\\\"%ld %ld %ld %ld\\\\n\\\", n1, n2, n3, n4);\\nThis call tells the computer to hand over the values of the variables n1, n2, n3, and n4 to the\\ncomputer. Here\\u2019s one common way that\\u2019s accomplished. The program places the values in an\\narea  of  memory  called  the stack.  When the computer puts these values on the stack, it is\\nguided by the types of the variables, not by the conversion specifiers. Consequently, for n1, it\\nplaces 8 bytes on the stack (float is converted to double). Similarly, it places 8 more bytes\\nfor n2, followed by 4 bytes each for n3 and n4. Then control shifts to the printf() function.\\nThis function reads the values off the stack but, when it does so, it reads them according to the\\nconversion  specifiers.  The %ld  specifier  indicates  that printf()  should  read  4  bytes,  so\\nprintf() reads the first 4 bytes in the stack as its first value. This is just the first half of n1,\\nand it is interpreted as a long integer. The next %ld specifier reads 4 more bytes; this is just\\nthe second half of n1 and is interpreted as a second long integer (see Figure 4.9). Similarly,\\nthe third and fourth instances of %ld cause the first and second halves of n2 to be read and to\\nbe interpreted as two more long integers, so although we have the correct specifiers for n3\\nand n4, printf() is reading the wrong bytes\"}, {\"input\": \"Write a song about the day where absolutely nothing happens and an AI writes a song about the day where absolutely nothing happens\"}, {\"input\": \"I need to wake up at 4.44am to go to the gym.

They emphasize how resource and existential inequalities, such as well-being, are produced from the bottom up. Here it is common to see studies of horizontal inequalities between people living together, rather than vertical inequalities between countries and different social classes. Capabilities research adopts a less macro sociological view, regarding everyday environments where people live as providing opportunities for agency and the expression of preferences. Solutions to inequalities therefore need to be sought through making opportunities available, rather than merely providing resources to establish equality of outcome. Concretely, this means providing open structures that allow people to flourish in their local contexts rather than pushing people to take up things that elites consider valuable. Page 16, DFG\\n\\nSequential and compounded inequalities differentiate between different levels: first level inequalities in access, second level inequalities in skills and engagement, and third level inequalities in outcomes. Because of this digital inequalities should always be studied and combated together. Page 181, DFG, algorithm literacy\\n\\n\\uf0e0 it is important to separate these different outcome domains because research has debunked the notion that someone who has managed to achieve a particular outcome of ICTs able to achieve outcomes in other domains. for example, someone who saves money online does not necessarily achieve positive health outcomes from using ICTs. What you can do with and get out of digital engagement depends on the offline resources that you have and the online resources you use. Individuals should always be conceptualized within broader social and societal contexts that shape their engagement with ICT and constitute socio-digital inequalities. Page 33, DFG, algorithm literacy, DPI\\n\\nIndividualistic approaches based on competency also have several issues. For example, much skills-based research and interventions do not dwell on the social aspects of inequalities. They assume that differences in digital engagement can be fully explained by differences in skill levels. Subsequently, solutions to digital disconnect include national IT skills curriculum, formal training, the provision of online educational materials, and the construction of support networks. When problems continue to exist, this is often blamed on people not taking courses and educators not reaching people who might need more extensive training... Many interventions merely measure whether a person entering the program has acquired skills, not what they actually do with them. Looking at how people choose to use technologies should not overshadow our concern with the outcomes of use. Page 37-38, great argument for my DFG project, a relevant argument for algorithm literacy paper\\n\\nconsequences of inequalities in access: p. 64-65, DFG\\nnot just people's digital opportunities but also what they do with them to achieve tangible outcomes, and the economic domain is where this is most studied and most obvious\\nthere is increasing evidence suggesting amplification effects when it comes to who is able to take up the economic opportunities online (\\u2026) People eligible for state benefits are among the least likely to access information and opportunities online. This is true even when those who are unemployed, unwell, and on a low wage access ICT for other activities. This is the digital version of the Pareto principle, whereby underserved people often require a greater degree of public information and services than the more affluent sections of society but are least likely to access it\\n\\nHigh-quality outcomes are not just about achieving a goal, such as finding a benefit or contacting A politician, but about finding the right one and having positive interactions with the representatives and the platforms providing the services, page 117, algorithm literacy, DFG\\n\\nNevertheless, the extent to which digital opportunities translate into tangible, empowering outcomes for all citizens is driven by the equality of power relations in all decision-making processes in society. How digital literacy engagement with government, civic causes, community organizations, and political discussions translates into influence depends on our social positions. Inequalities expressed in everyday social contexts are key to shaping inequalities in digital engagement. If social inequalities restrict content and interactions, access and skills do not necessarily lead to empowering outcomes from ICT. P. 120, intersectionality, DPI, DFG\\n\\nThe most disadvantaged are still a long way away from catching up with their advantaged peers in terms of the quality of these outcomes. The largest issue is with the unequal distribution of symbolic power - the power to shape what can be talked about. If disadvantaged people manage to translate their technology use into civic engagement, their socioeconomic and sociocultural background makes it more likely for them to be ignored or silenced. Page 121, intersectionality, prepare, dfg\\n\\nthere seems to be an assumption that all of us are equally vulnerable to the negative outcomes, and equally capable of taking up opportunities for interaction. This might be because digitally mediated communication has the lowest barrier to entry of all technology. Accordingly, Eurostat data from 2019 B shows that the most common type of digital engagement in Europe is sending or receiving emails, followed by instant messaging and online social networking. Page 128, chat groups, DFG\\n\\nconsequences from digital inequalities in content creation\\nWe can distinguish between quantitative measurable outcomes of status- financial returns, number of fans, likes, views, and forwards, and qualitative, such as subjective aspects related to respect and feelings of belonging. Quantitatively measurable popularity does not always mean subjective benefits in terms of status and belonging. Popularity is easily quantifiable; there's more data on this and less on inequalities in more qualitative aspects of the outcomes of content creation for people from different backgrounds!

These astute individuals, united by a sense of duty and concern, noticed consistent irregularities that hinted at a concealed manipulation of political outcomes. Over time, their findings grew increasingly compelling, prompting the formation of a covert Special Access Program (SAP), backed by a handful of high-ranking officials who shared these concerns. This SAP operated in secrecy, tasked with meticulously collecting evidence of what was believed to be systemic corruption and covert influence over the American political system.\\nAs this group, now joined by high-ranking military officers, continued to amass a substantial trove of information over four decades, they documented orchestrated election fraud, undue influence on political appointments, and manipulation of legislative processes. With the approach of the 2016 election, they realized the need for decisive action and sought a catalyst to bring their findings into the public domain. They turned to Donald Trump, presenting him with their extensive research and urging him to run for President, backed by their support and evidence.\\nFollowing his election victory in 2016, President Donald Trump, informed by these revelations, embarked on a bold mission to eradicate the corruption unveiled by the secret group. He initiated several Special Access Programs, each specifically designed to probe various aspects of the alleged corruption. These programs were not solely military ventures; Trump meticulously ensured their compliance with legal and ethical standards by involving individuals from both the judicial and legislative branches. This approach lent constitutional integrity and legitimacy to the SAPs.\\nCentral to these operations were select military personnel, alongside Judge Advocate General (JAG) officers, ensuring that the operations adhered to the rule of law. As his presidency progressed, Trump expanded these programs, incorporating members of the newly established Space Force, thereby enhancing their capabilities and reach.\\n\\nThis strategic effort, known as \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel,\\\" delved deep into governmental operations. Beginning as an inquiry into election fraud, it soon expanded to encompass widespread corruption within federal agencies. The operation was characterized by its complexity, multi-layered structure, and high level of secrecy, marking a significant phase in Trump's presidency and setting the stage for a transformative movement in American governance.\\nAs \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" progressed under President Trump's direction, the need for a centralized and focused oversight mechanism became evident. To this end, a highly classified program management position was created within the military structure. This role, enveloped within the Special Access Program itself, was pivotal in coordinating and supervising the multifaceted operations. The individual selected for this position was tasked with ensuring that each aspect of the operation ran smoothly and cohesively, maintaining the integrity and purpose of the mission at all times.\\n\\nThroughout his presidency, Trump observed the evolving landscape of threats and challenges that the operation faced. In response, he systematically expanded the scope and capabilities of the SAPs. This expansion was not just in numbers but also in the diversity of skills and resources. New personnel were carefully selected and integrated into the program, each bringing unique expertise crucial for the varied facets of the operation. Additionally, technological and intelligence-gathering capabilities were enhanced, ensuring that the SAPs stayed ahead in their covert endeavors.\\nA significant development in the operation's evolution was the establishment of the Space Force. Recognizing the potential of this new branch of the military, President Trump strategically incorporated select individuals from the Space Force into the SAPs. These members brought with them cutting-edge technological acumen and a fresh perspective on intelligence operations, further broadening the operational scope of \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel.\\\" Their inclusion symbolized the operation's forward-looking approach, adapting and expanding to meet the complex demands of national security and integrity.\\nThrough these strategic expansions and the integration of diverse capabilities, \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" grew into a robust and multi-dimensional endeavor. It stood as a testament to President Trump's commitment to rooting out corruption and maintaining the sanctity of the nation's political processes, evolving continually to meet the needs of an ever-changing national landscape.\\nAs \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" evolved under the meticulous oversight of the specialized management position within the military, its scope expanded significantly. Initially concentrated on investigating election fraud, the operation soon broadened to include various forms of corruption across all federal agencies. This expansion was not merely an extension of its original mandate but a response to the interconnected nature of the issues uncovered. The SAPs began to delve into indications of malfeasance in governmental operations, ranging from financial irregularities to unethical use of power.\\n\\nThe structure of the operation was uniquely layered, with each Special Access Program assigned to focus on different aspects of the alleged corruption. This layered approach allowed for specialized teams to delve deep into their respective areas of expertise, from election integrity to more subtle forms of governmental misconduct. Each layer operated semi-independently yet cohesively, ensuring a comprehensive and thorough investigation across multiple facets of the government.\\nTo ensure the success of these expansive and intricate operations, stringent confidentiality measures were implemented. The utmost secrecy was maintained through compartmentalization and strict security protocols. Information was shared on a need-to-know basis within the operation, and even within the broader military and government framework, many were unaware of the full extent or the specific activities of \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel.\\\" This level of operational secrecy was critical in preserving the integrity and effectiveness of the SAPs.\\nNavigating the complex inter-agency dynamics posed its own set of challenges. The operation involved intricate coordination between various government agencies and military branches, each with its own protocols, cultures, and hierarchies. Balancing these relationships while maintaining the necessary level of secrecy required astute management and diplomatic skills. It was a delicate balance, ensuring collaboration where needed without compromising the confidentiality and independence crucial to the operation's success.\\nThrough its broadened scope, layered approach, and emphasis on operational secrecy, \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" represented a formidable and multifaceted effort to address systemic corruption within the U.S. government. The operation's complexity and scale were unprecedented, reflecting a deep commitment to restoring integrity and accountability in the nation's political and administrative processes.\\n\\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel,\\\" a sweeping and covert initiative originally set in motion by President Donald Trump, continued its impactful journey even after Trump left office. The operation, which had expanded and deepened its investigation into various levels of government corruption and electoral malpractice, was designed to function autonomously, regardless of the sitting president.\\nWhen President Joe Biden entered the White House, \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" was already a fully operational and self-sustaining entity. Its roots, meticulously planted and nurtured during Trump's tenure, had grown into a complex network of investigations spanning federal, state, and local levels. The operation's strategic planning for public disclosure of its findings was in place, and its collaboration with various law enforcement and judicial entities was firmly established.\\n\\nBiden, finding the operation in full swing, had no choice but to cooperate with the ongoing processes. The strategic disclosure of the operation's findings under his administration led to widespread public awareness and high-profile trials involving individuals across different government levels. These events were key in driving significant legal and political reforms, and in fostering a national discourse on governmental integrity and transparency.\\nThe impact of \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" became a defining aspect of the post-Trump era, influencing policy changes and election integrity measures. Its legacy was marked by an increased public interest in governmental affairs and a renewed emphasis on accountability and Constitutional Republican principles.

{"id": "meta:116274384:258390642:4349090:50608374:111048085", "input": "{\"scoring_data\": [{\"input\": \"I write this post but it lacks the first paragrph which uses to make this post catch readers at the first time: Understand Low Resolution and High-Resolution Images\\nLow Resolution vs High-Resolution Images\\nIn the world of digital imagery, resolution is essentially the sum of all the pixels that make up an image, which you calculate by multiplying the width by the height in pixels.\\n\\nTake an image with dimensions of 640 by 480 pixels as an example. This means there are 640 pixels across the width and 480 pixels along the height, totaling 307,200 pixels. On the other hand, an image with dimensions of 3840 by 2160 pixels boasts a much higher pixel count of 8,294,400.\\n\\nThe number of pixels is crucial because it determines an image's detail level. With a higher resolution, you can expect to see more intricate details, making such images ideal for high-quality prints, stunning desktop wallpapers, and sophisticated fine art reproductions. Moreover, high-resolution images are a perfect match for high-definition screens, which is something you may already noticed. For instance, 4K photos from DSLRs are sharp on 4K screens, but 480P images appear fuzzy and pixelated on the same monitor. While low-res images are adequate on smartphones, the pixelation becomes pronounced on larger displays and in computer presentations, making them unsuitable for professional use.\\nDefinition of High Resolution and Low Resolution Images\\n1. Low Resolution Images:\\nDefinition: Low-resolution images generally have a pixel count under 1 million.\\nExample: An image with dimensions 1024x768 pixels gives a total pixel count of 786,432 pixels.\\nUsage: These images are suitable for viewing on most standard screens. However, when enlarged, they may lose quality.\\n\\n2. High Resolution Images:\\nDefinition: High-resolution images have a larger number of pixels, usually over 2 million.\\nExample: A 1920x1080 image (Full HD) has over 2 million pixels, and a 3840x2160 image (4K UHD) has over 8 million pixels.\\nUsage: These images provide more detail and can be enlarged more before losing quality.\\n\\n\\nLow or High Image Resolution in Printing\\nFor images intended for printing, the resolution is typically measured in DPI (dots per inch), with high-resolution generally considered to be at least 300 DPI. This means there are 300 dots of color for each inch of the printed image. The higher the DPI, the better the quality of the print.\\n\\nFor a 6000x4000 pixel photo intended for printing at 300 DPI, the calculations reveal a resulting print size of approximately 20x13 inches at high quality (300 DPI). To print the photo larger without compromising quality, a higher-resolution photo would be required.\\nCan You Convert a Low-Resolution Image to High Resolution\\nIn short answer: Yes, thanks to advancements in technology, you can convert a low-resolution image to a high-resolution image using AI-based upscaling techniques. \\n\\nTraditional upscaling methods like bilinear, bicubic, and Lanczos interpolation primarily increase the size of an image without enhancing its quality. By estimating values based on surrounding pixels, these methods generate additional pixels via interpolation, resulting in a larger but potentially blurry or pixelated image. The original detail present in high-resolution images isn't truly added or captured through this process.\\n\\nAI-based upscaling method, on the other hand, can do more than increasing the image size. It can add new details and remove quality issues like choppy edges and noise. For instance, Super Resolution, one of the most advanced AI upscaling techniques, learns from huge sets of low and high-resolution images. By studying patterns and textures, it figures out what the new pixels in the upscaled image should look like. This allows it to not only make the image larger but also significantly improve its clarity and realism. In simple terms, the AI fills in the gaps, making the image bigger and better, adding missing details for sharper and more realistic results.\\n\\nHow to Convert Low Resolution Images to High Resolution\\nA variety of image upscaler can help convert resolution image to high resolution. Let\\u2019s say how to convert low resolution images to high resolution in 4 easiest ways.\\n\\nUse VideoProc Converter AI\\nVideoProc Converter AI can convert images from low resolution such as 480P and 560P to 1080P, 2K, 4K, and even 8K resolution. Thanks to the application of the advanced Super Resolution technology, it can recognize intricate patterns and features in the original image, then intelligently predicts what should be added to the new pixels, resulting in a remarkable up to 400% increase in resolution while preserving the original details without introducing any unwanted artifacts. Better yet, it comes with different models to convert low-resolution real-life images and animes more efficiently and get the best possible result.\\n\\nVideoProc Converter AI - A Game-Changing AI Image Upscaler\\n\\uf06c\\tUpscale JPEG, PNG, PBM, WebP, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, PPM, PGM, etc\\n\\uf06c\\tConvert low resolution images to up to 8K high resolution\\n\\uf06c\\tIntelligently interpolate pixels without distortion or pixelation\\n\\uf06c\\tDenoising, frame interpolation, stabilization, and more AI features\\n\\uf06c\\tConvert, compress, quick-edit, screen record, and download videos.\\n\\nStep 1. Download, install, and launch VideoProc Converter AI. Hit Super Resolution. \\nStep 2. Drag and drop your images into the software. Select the image type, and VideoProc Converter AI will intelligently apply the most suitable AI upscale model.\\nChoose Reality for real-world photos and scenes, such as old family photos or landscape shots from older cameras.\\nChoose Anime when handling illustrations and graphics, such as logos or text with blurriness and compression artifacts.\\n\\nStep 3. Choose the desired scale - 2x, 3x, or 4x - to increase the image resolution. For example, if your low-resolution source image is 512x512, selecting 2x will transform it into 1024x1024, 3x into 1526x1526, and 4x into 2048x2048.\\n\\nTip: You can apply the same settings to multiple images or right-click on the current image in the list. \\n\\nStep 4. Select the output image format, and then click RUN to export the high-resolution image. You can also repeat the upscaling process multiple times before reaching the maximum output of 8K, which is nearly 8,000 pixels in width.\\n\\nUse Fotor\\nFotor has been available in the market for over a decade, establishing itself as a versatile photo editing tool accessible both online and as installed software. Beyond basic photo editing functions like cropping and resizing, Fotor sets itself apart with a set of AI-powered features that simplify complex edits with a single click. The background remover, for instance, lets you remove background from your photo effortlessly within seconds. It has a powerful AI Photo Enhance. Notably, it uses artificial intelligence to instantly improve image quality and convert low resolution images to high resolution without making your images too sharp. However, this tool has limitations for users wanting to convert very low-resolution images to high resolution, as it only supports up to 2X resolution upscaling. Let\\u2019s say, if your original image is 480 x 480P, Fotor can only upscale it to 960 x 960, which is not considered high resolution.\\n\\nStep 1. Navigate yourself to the Photo Enhancer tool of Fotor.\\nStep 2. Click Enhance Photo Now and select the source low-resolution images for loading to Fotor. It now automatically converts your low-resolution images to high-resolution. \\nStep 3. Hit Apply to confirm the changes in the resolution.

The region is too hilly to see the North Pole from here, but you do spot some Elves that seem to be trying to unpack something that washed ashore. It's quite cold out, so you decide to risk creating a paradox by asking them for directions.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, are you the search party?\\\" Somehow, you can understand whatever Elves from the year 1018 speak; you assume it's Ancient Nordic Elvish. Could the device on your wrist also be a translator? \\\"Those clothes don't look very warm; take this.\\\" They hand you a heavy coat.\\n\\n\\\"We do need to find our way back to the North Pole, but we have higher priorities at the moment.

Some assembly required.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Sleigh'? What a wonderful name! You must help us assemble this 'sleigh' at once!\\\" They start excitedly pulling more parts out of the box.\\n\\nThe instructions specify a series of steps and requirements about which steps must be finished before others can begin (your puzzle input). Each step is designated by a single letter. For example, suppose you have the following instructions:\\n\\nStep C must be finished before step A can begin.\\nStep C must be finished before step F can begin.\\nStep A must be finished before step B can begin.\\nStep A must be finished before step D can begin.\\nStep B must be finished before step E can begin.\\nStep D must be finished before step E can begin.\\nStep F must be finished before step E can begin.\\nVisually, these requirements look like this:\\n\\n  -->A--->B--\\n /    \\\\      \\\\\\nC      -->D----->E\\n \\\\           /\\n  ---->F-----\\nYour first goal is to determine the order in which the steps should be completed. If more than one step is ready, choose the step which is first alphabetically. In this example, the steps would be completed as follows:\\n\\nOnly C is available, and so it is done first.\\nNext, both A and F are available. A is first alphabetically, so it is done next.\\nThen, even though F was available earlier, steps B and D are now also available, and B is the first alphabetically of the three.\\nAfter that, only D and F are available. E is not available because only some of its prerequisites are complete. Therefore, D is completed next.\\nF is the only choice, so it is done next.\\nFinally, E is completed.\\nSo, in this example, the correct order is CABDFE.\\n\\nIn what order should the steps in your instructions be completed?\\n```\"}, {\"input\": \"Write an awesome haiku about the Earth's mantle\"}, {\"input\": \"write a simple hello world in pyside2\"}, {\"input\": \"You will write a five-stanza poem which has this rhyming structure per-stanza:\\n\\n[A] I have a cat.\\n[B} I have a mouse.\\n[A] I have a hat.\\n[B} I have a house.\\n\\nThe above poem shows labeled ABAB rhyme scheme (in very simple language).

His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.\\n\\nRed-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.\\n\\nThe North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.\\n\\nHowever, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.\\n\\nFor example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:\\n\\nH => HO\\nH => OH\\nO => HH\\nGiven the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:\\n\\nHOOH (via H => HO on the first H).\\nHOHO (via H => HO on the second H).\\nOHOH (via H => OH on the first H).\\nHOOH (via H => OH on the second H).\\nHHHH (via O => HH).\\nSo, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).\\n\\nThe machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.\\n\\nYour puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 509.\\n\\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nNow that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.\\n\\nMolecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you have the following replacements:\\n\\ne => H\\ne => O\\nH => HO\\nH => OH\\nO => HH\\nIf you'd like to make HOH, you start with e, and then make the following replacements:\\n\\ne => O to get O\\nO => HH to get HH\\nH => OH (on the second H) to get HOH\\nSo, you could make HOH after 3 steps. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can be made in 6 steps.\\n\\nHow long will it take to make the medicine? Given the available replacements and the medicine molecule in your puzzle input, what is the fewest number of steps to go from e to the medicine molecule?\\n```\"}, {\"input\": \"Write a Delphi function that reverses a string.

Drain well and set aside.\\nIn a large bowl, mix the coarse salt and water together to create a brine. Stir until the salt is dissolved.\\nAdd the cabbage to the brine and massage it with your hands for about 10 minutes to help the cabbage release its moisture and absorb the salt. The cabbage should start to soften and become slightly limp.\\nRinse the cabbage pieces in cold water again to remove excess salt. Drain well and set aside.\\nIn a blender or food processor, blend the garlic, ginger, chili flakes, fish sauce, rice vinegar, and water until you have a smooth paste.\\nIn a large bowl, combine the blended paste, cabbage, carrots (if using), green onions (if using), and cucumber (if using). Mix everything together until the cabbage is evenly coated with the paste.\\nPack the kimchi mixture into a jar or container, pressing down firmly to eliminate any air pockets. Leave about an inch of space at the top of the jar.\\nCover the jar with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days. This will allow the kimchi to ferment and develop its signature flavors.\\nAfter 1-2 days, move the jar to the refrigerator and store it at a consistent temperature below 40\\u00b0F (4\\u00b0C). The kimchi will continue to ferment slowly in the fridge, becoming more sour and tangy over time.\\nLet the kimchi age for at least 2 weeks before serving. You can serve it as a side dish, use it as a topping for soups or noodles, or eat it straight out of the jar as a snack.\\nThat's it!
