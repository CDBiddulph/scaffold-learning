The day was beginning and the sun had been starting to rise up for barely two hours when a deafening and thunderous rumble resounded through the atmosphere and a dazzling light flooded the whole area even the rocky hills distant about ten to twenty kilometers got illuminated. The anthropomorphic predator mammal inhabitants of the tiny town situated near the center of the plain got out from their buildings and filled the streets. And several isolated predators living in isolated houses more or less distant from the town did the same. Anthropomorphic wolves, foxes, tigers, hyenas and different other species\\u2026 All of them looked in the sky jaws agape with disbelief. An immense object the size of a mountain was descending and humongous rocket engines were throwing enormous kilometer long flames. The object was still high in the sky but the sound was ears shattering and the temperature already increasing threateningly. Also it was obvious the object was aiming to land in the middle of the plain, where the town was located. A panic spread through the citizens and they hurried to leave the place, most of them using their cars. The streets got jammed. Most managed to reach the limit of the town and get some kilometers but it was already too late as the blazing hurricane coming from the rockets pulverized the whole town and several kilometers of plain and forest around. The few survivors crawled away among the scorched rubble and ashes.\\nThe ground of the whole region trembled when the object that was metallic and now towering the whole landscape landed, its landing pads sinking deep in the ground under its unimaginable weight.\\nThen a huge hatch opened slowly and a humongous burly two hundreds meters tall figure appeared.\\nHe passed through the hatch. His thirty meter long booted and massive foot caused a tremor when it sank in the scorched ground as did every of his heavy steps. He looked around watching the comparatively diminutive landscape. If if body had the shape of a very heavily and burly built human, his head and face was looking like the one of a rabbit and his long ears pricked up showing some excitation to discover such a new place. Another gigantic anthropomorphic rabbit of the same size and built got out from the hatch and walked at the side of the first one. And a third and a fourth one. Their rabbit noses twitched as the breathed the fresh air of this planet they just reached for the first time.

Convicted felon, Con man, alleged thief, and online stalker & chaos agent. Although Mr. Schoenberger claims limited contact and interaction with Isaac, he has both been accused of having something to do with the death of Isaac Kappy and made allegations himself that others (Manny Chavez III, Gabe Hoffman, Kelly Gianinni, Brett Trimble, and recently myself) are responsible for Isaac\\u2019s death. Mr. Schoenberger is currently embroiled as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by Gabe Hoffman for these accusations. Mr. Hoffman has also sued and/or threatened to sue several other people (including myself) for perceived defamation surrounding the Isaac Kappy event.\\n\\nAfter nearly a year and a half of investigation into the death of Isaac Kappy, it does not shock me in the least to know that Isaac was approached by Thomas Schoenberger early on when Isaac first came out with his allegations of Hollywood pedophilia. I believe Thomas S. not only knows more about the death of Isaac Kappy than he\\u2019ll ever admit but also Isaac\\u2019s mental breakdown prior to it. After all the investigation, bullshit, lies, diversion, and misdirection there are a few simple reasons I believe this.\\n\\nThe laundry list of Mr. Schoenberger\\u2019s victims who have come out of the woodwork accusing him of \\u201cmind-fucking\\u201d them. Most of them claim that Thomas personally led to their emotional and psychological breakdown resulting in loss of work, income, savings, and health, requiring in many circumstances hospitalization/medical attention/loss of income/depression & terror.\\nThe Judas Prophecy. See (The Judas Prophecy here.)\\nIsaac Kappy\\u2019s mental breakdown (fear, terror, paranoia) closely follows the same pattern as many of Thomas Schoenberger\\u2019s other victims.\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s jacket. T.S. has a lifetime involvement with online scams, drama, bad business deals, intimidation, stalking, litigation, and convictions. (You can find many of his court case PDF records below).\\nThomas\\u2019s attempt to pull me into his online war with Defango, Lestat, Gabe Hoffman, and others in order to derail my investigation.\\nThomas\\u2019s attempts to pull me into scams and online harassment of others in order to compromise myself while attempting to work me into a position of vulnerability wherein I would require Thomas\\u2019s assistance and protection. BTW, this is Thomas\\u2019s Modus Operandi. All communications, emails, text messages, phone calls, etc are recorded, stored, and later used as leverage/blackmail when Thomas will eventually turn on you, or threaten to do so. Social media is awash with videos and recordings of Mr. Schoenberger threatening just this. AND, of course, he has already made this treat to me as well.\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s self-proclaimed association with 3-letter government agencies. Primarily the CIA. According to witnesses I\\u2019ve interviewed, Thomas has bragged and boasted his entire life (since his early 20\\u2019s) that his father worked for the CIA as did he. Whereas this may or may not be true, I have spoken with three different people who\\u2019ve known Thomas his entire life and state that he has told them this. Thomas may very well believe this himself, or he could simply be a 3-letter agency asset, used to create chaos and execute online harassment/movement/etc. Admittedly, this is pure speculation, however, it is well within the realm of possibilities.\\nIt is important to note that with all the allegations of gang stocking and intentional psychological trauma, Thomas alleges he had no known dealings or knowledge of either Eliahi Priest or Gabe Hoffman prior to Isaac coming forward with his Hollywood Pedophilia allegations. Many Chavez III (Defango) however, knew and had worked with them both. It was also Defango who introduced Isaac to Mr. Priest.\\n\\nIT IS MY OPINION THAT THOMAS SCHOENBERGER IS A MONSTER IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. BASED ON FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE MR. SCHOENBERGER IS EASILY ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE SHEER NUMBER OF VICTIMS I HAVE SPOKEN TO HAVE ATTESTED TO THE TRAIL OF PAIN, DESTRUCTION & LOSS THOMAS SCHOENBERGER HAS BROUGHT TO THEM & OTHERS THROUGH HIS PERPETUAL NARCISTIC FUELED CHAOS AND MENTAL & EMOTIONAL TORTURE. ALL OF THIS DONE TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF FINANCIALLY THROUGH HIS CONS WHILE PROVIDING HIS NARCISSISTIC SUPPLY. IN SHORT, THOMAS SCHOENBERGER IS ONE OF THE MOST DISGUSTING PEOPLE I\\u2019VE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE TO KNOW AND THE DAY HE PAYS FOR HIS CRIMES WON\\u2019T COME SOON ENOUGH.\\n\\nThe following tweet was made by the \\u201cAn Open Secret\\u201d Twitter account which is operated by Gabe Hoffman.\\nThomas Schoenberger and Gabe Hoffman are currently embroiled in a defamation lawsuit filed by Mr. Hoffman. Whereas Mr. Hoffman had come out with the following tweet 14 days after the death of Isaac Kappy, Mr. Schoenberger has since outrightly accused Mr. Hoffman of being directly involved with the death of Isaac Kappy.\\n\\nIsaac Kappy suicide:\\n\\nFriends and concerned parties should focus research on\\n\\nThomas Schoenberger aka Thomas St Germain & Cicada 3301\\n\\nTS has a long documented history of gang-stalking, psychological manipulation & nefarious activities\\n\\n\\u2014 An Open Secret (@AnOpenSecret) May 27, 2019\\n\\nWho is Thomas Schoenberger\\nSurely you don\\u2019t mean the polymath, composer, historian, entrepreneur, event designer, inventor, and writer?\\n\\nYup, I mean the very one.\\n\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s website \\u2013 https://www.thomasschoenberger.com/blog/\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s \\u201cSophia Musik\\u201d YouTube Channel \\u2013 https://www.youtube.com/c/SophiaMusik/videos\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s Sound Cloud.com Site \\u2013 https://soundcloud.com/user-413210604\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s \\u201cTrueBlood\\u201d Stalking YouTube Channel \\u2013 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLUtW6ELvnvTt8iJKC0sW8Q\\nBandcamp \\u2013 https://thomasschoenbergerclassicalical.bandcamp.com/\\nLinkedin \\u2013 https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-schoenberger-69b93370/\\nFrom the front page of Thomas Schoenberger\\u2019s website.\\n\\nThomas Schoenberger is a polymath, composer, historian, entrepreneur event designer, inventor, and writer. His compositions have been performed by leading musical groups, including the Moscow Chamber Orchestra and other notable artists worldwide. His historical observations are developed through his extensive travels throughout Europe, the Middle East, and America.\\n\\nAn unusually prolific composer, he has created thousands of original compositions, from piano concertos to symphonies and operas.\\n\\nQuite the portfolio for a man with no job, no studio, no partners (only past partners who have sued him and have warned the world about Thomas afterward), and who\\u2019s past tax records report next to no income.

GERMAIN, AND DID SO IN AN INTERVIEW WITH ME, HE HAS TOLD MANY PEOPLE HE BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE THE REINCARNATION OF ST. GERMAIN.\\n\\nFrom Wikipedia\\n\\nCount Saint Germain (also sometimes referred to as Master R\\u00e1k\\u00f3czi or Master R) is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various Theosophical and post-Theosophical teachings, said to be responsible for the New Age culture of the Age of Aquarius and identified with the Count Saint Germain (fl. 1710\\u20131784), who has been variously described as a courtier, adventurer, inventor, alchemist, pianist, violinist, and amateur composer.\\n\\nThe Many Faces of Thomas Schoenberger\\nThomas Schoenberger has attempted to keep his photos off of social media to the greatest extent possible in an attempt to minimize exposure. I believe this is in an attempt to isolate his online stalking behavior from his legitimate musical career business (Sophia Music) which is big in Europe. Still victims of T.S. continue to post and share his photos in their effort to warn others about him.\\n\\nunnamed \\nFullSizeRender-1 \\nFullSizeRender-2 \\nThomas-circa-1984 \\nFullSizeRender-4 \\nOLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA \\ndownload-1 \\nFullSizeRender \\nFullSizeRender-3 \\nimages-1 \\nhqdefault \\ndownload \\nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-40-778 \\nimages \\nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-18-204 \\nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-29-486 \\nbandicam-2020-12-09-23-24-17-638\\n[SHOW SLIDESHOW]\\nVictims & Survivors of Thomas Schoenberger\\nThis section is dedicated to outlining & sharing the already public information/stories/testimonies/ PDF court documents/ related to those individuals whom Thomas Schoenberger has victimized over the course of his lifetime. \\nKathy Litton (1979)\\nRick Holliday \\u2013 Claims that T.S. was a cocaine user/dealer, professional thief, and con artist.

It requires abstracting the characteristics of these \\\"demons\\\" beyond the specific contexts in which they operate. To embark on this endeavor, let's consider some potential categories based on general principles of interaction:\\n\\nCyclic Amplifiers:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" are characterized by their ability to amplify existing issues within a system, often through feedback loops. They take small dysfunctions and escalate them, leading to larger systemic problems.\\n\\nExamples: Hydra (anxiety disorders), Sisyphus (major depressive disorder).\\nResonance Inducers:\\nResonance inducers are \\\"demons\\\" that synchronize with certain frequencies or patterns within a system, causing them to become dominant and overshadow other functions. They tap into natural tendencies and exaggerate them to the point of dysfunction.\\n\\nExamples: Marid (narcissistic personality disorder), Loki (impulse control disorders).\\nEntropy Escalators:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" contribute to the breakdown of order within a system, increasing chaos and disorder. They disrupt regulatory mechanisms and lead to a state of disorganization that can become self-sustaining.\\n\\nExamples: Aeolus (chaotic work environments), Eris (interpersonal conflicts).\\nParasitic Persisters:\\nParasitic persisters are \\\"demons\\\" that attach to the system and drain its resources while offering little or no benefit. They may create dependencies or exploit vulnerabilities, sapping the system's strength over time.\\n\\nExamples: Tantalus (addiction), Banshee (PTSD).\\nInhibitory Blockers:\\nInhibitory blockers are \\\"demons\\\" that prevent the system from engaging in necessary change or adaptation. They block growth, learning, or evolution by stifling innovation or maintaining the status quo.\\n\\nExamples: Pygmalion (toxic leadership), Cassandra (unheeded expertise).\\nEcho Generators:\\nEcho generators are \\\"demons\\\" that reinforce and multiply specific signals within a system, leading to a narrowing of perspective and a reduction in diversity. They create echo chambers where only certain messages are heard and reinforced.\\n\\nExamples: Baku (echo chambers), Narcissus (corporate egoism).\\nDichotomy Drivers:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" polarize the system, driving a wedge between components and creating an \\\"us versus them\\\" mentality. They exacerbate divisions and hinder cooperation and integration.\\n\\nExamples: Janus (bipolar disorder), Leviathan (systemic corruption).\\nThis classification is not exhaustive, and many \\\"demons\\\" may exhibit characteristics from multiple categories. However, it provides a framework for understanding how these metaphorical entities interact with systems on a fundamental level, independent of the scale or specific domain in which they manifest. It also allows us to consider strategies for addressing these \\\"demons\\\" by targeting the underlying principles of their interactions within the system.\\n\\nThis is fascinating. What worries me maybe is that it's not a very strict classification, as various of the demons we have proposed before overlap between categories. Propose other cathegories that don't have that proble. Maybe try with fewer more general ones (we can add subtypes after).\\n\\nTo create a more precise and non-overlapping taxonomical classification of metaphorical \\\"demons,\\\" we can distill the categories down to a few fundamental interaction types that are distinct from each other. These categories can describe the primary way in which these \\\"demons\\\" perpetuate cycles within systems. From there, we can explore subtypes for additional nuance.\\n\\nHere are three general categories:\\n\\nFeedback Loopers:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" are defined by their role in creating and sustaining feedback loops, whether positive or negative, that lead to the amplification or suppression of certain system behaviors or states.\\n\\nPositive Feedback Loopers: Entities that cause runaway effects, leading to exponential growth or decline within a system. They represent unchecked escalation, such as addiction or environmental exploitation.\\nNegative Feedback Loopers: Entities that enforce a status quo or equilibrium, potentially leading to stagnation or resistance to necessary change. They symbolize systems that are unable to escape from dysfunctional but stable patterns, such as toxic work cultures or bureaucratic inertia.\\nSystemic Disruptors:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" are characterized by their ability to disrupt the regular functioning of a system, leading to chaos, disorder, or maladaptation.\\n\\nChaos Inducers: Entities that introduce variability, randomness, or inconsistency, undermining the stability of a system, similar to erratic leadership or unpredictable market forces.\\nRigidity Promoters: Entities that impose excessive order or inflexibility, stifling adaptability and creativity, akin to overregulation or a fear-based corporate culture.\\nIntegration Inhibitors:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" prevent the harmonious integration of system components, leading to fragmentation, isolation, or polarization.\\n\\nFragmenters: Entities that create or exacerbate divisions within a system, similar to the divisive impact of echo chambers or groupthink.\\nIsolators: Entities that cause components of a system to become detached from one another, leading to disconnection and lack of synergy, as seen in the social withdrawal of depression or the siloing of departments within an organization.\\nBy focusing on these three primary categories, we can more clearly define the nature of each \\\"demon\\\" and avoid overlap. Each category reflects a fundamental way in which the \\\"demon\\\" interacts with and influences the system it inhabits. Subtypes offer additional specificity, allowing us to capture the diverse manifestations of these metaphorical entities across different scales and contexts.\\n\\nwhich was the demon that caused WWI and how would you classify it? and the demon that caused fascism? and cell metastasis?\\n\\nThe complex historical events like World War I, the rise of fascism, and biological processes like cell metastasis can be metaphorically attributed to \\\"demons\\\" in a symbolic sense, representing the destructive forces or processes that contribute to these phenomena. Here's how they might be classified within our taxonomy:\\n\\nWorld War I:\\nThe \\\"demon\\\" that contributed to the outbreak of World War I could be seen as a Systemic Disruptor in the form of a Chaos Inducer. The intricate web of alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism acted as a chaotic and unstable system. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the catalyst in an already volatile system, with each nation's actions amplifying the others' in a domino effect, leading to a breakdown of diplomatic relations and the onset of war. This demon thrived on the lack of effective communication and the rigid adherence to alliances and militaristic posturing that ultimately plunged the world into conflict.\\n\\nFascism:\\nThe rise of fascism can be attributed to a Feedback Looper with characteristics of both Positive Feedback Loopers and Negative Feedback Loopers. As a Positive Feedback Looper, fascism capitalized on economic instability, fear, and the desire for national rejuvenation to create a self-reinforcing cycle of power consolidation and societal polarization. As a Negative Feedback Looper, it also enforced a status quo of authoritarian control, suppressing dissent and resistance to maintain its grip on power. The demon of fascism grew in strength by exploiting social divisions, economic hardships, and using propaganda to create a mythic national unity that often led to the exclusion or persecution of 'the other.'\\n\\nCell Metastasis:\\nIn the biological realm, cell metastasis can be metaphorically described as a Feedback Looper in the form of a Positive Feedback Looper. Here, the \\\"demon\\\" is not an external force but an emergent property of the system where cells begin to divide uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. The breakdown of normal regulatory mechanisms that keep cell growth in check leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of growth and invasion. The cellular environment and genetic mutations can create conditions that promote further growth and metastatic spread, illustrating how a system's regulation can be undermined from within.\\n\\nIt's important to note that these \\\"demons\\\" are metaphorical constructs used to conceptualize and discuss the complex dynamics at play in historical, social, and biological phenomena. Demons as the representation of self-perpetuating cycles of micro-interactions that affect negatively their native systems given structures of organization not built for that end (the metastasis of their intended purpose).

In contrast short audio speech offers new avenues for regular self-assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive changes. This alternative tool for dementia and MCI screening, overcomes numerous limitations of traditional testing. Firstly, it can be conducted with minimal or no assistance from non-professional staff or family members, making it more flexible for anytime-anywhere assessment and thus feasible for regular cognitive change monitoring (8). This is particularly beneficial in light of the COVID pandemic's adverse impact on community healthcare routines (9). Additionally, the analytic platform integrated with the assessment tool enables efficient management of assessment data and automated execution of the entire assessment process. especially in low-income and rural areas where healthcare resources are limited, and people may not have access to traditional screening methods. In recent years, the use of short speeches for early dementia risk prediction has garnered significant research interest. Short audio events (SAEs) serve as promising biomarkers for predicting or identifying the risk for dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using machine learning or deep learning models(Javeed et al., 2023). \\\" \"}, {\"input\": \"\\\"POTUS released an EO that imposes reporting flopcaps on models and datacenters.\\\" What does this mean by \\\"reporting flopcaps\\\"?\"}, {\"input\": \"What is red color made of?\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

An additional 2.5 cm was cut off of one of the cups to ensure this cup could fit comfortably\\ninto the other cup. A hole with a diameter of 0.5 cm was cut into the bottom of the shorter cup. A\\nthermometer was inserted into the hole and it made a loud, high-pitched noise. While\\n\\u2018conducting each reaction, the reactants were placed into the taller cup without the hole, and the\\nshorter cup with the thermometer was immediately placed upside down, with the hole for the\\nthermometer facing up, and firmly into the taller cup, to not let any heat escape.\\n\\nFo tha fret raartinn 25 Ami. af NaH and HOI ware canarataly maaeirad aid and tha. here is another: bd\\nFor this experiment, a calorimeter was constructed and used for each test. When the calorimeter\\n\\n\\u2018was constructed, two DART 12112 styrofoam coffee cups were used. For one cup, five pencil marks,\\n\\nmeasuring 5.2 cm, were placed around the brim of the cup using a 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical\\n\\nPencil. Using these marks as a guide, 5.2 cm was cut around the brim of the cup using Westcott scissors.\\n\\nA hole for the glass alcohol thermometer was then formed on the bottom of this cup by gently poking its\\n\\nbase with the 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical Pencil until it reached a diameter of 0.5 cm. On the other\\n\\nDART 1212 styrofoam coffee cup, the same steps used to construct the first cup were repeated,\\n\\nhowever, a hole was not made on the base of this cup, and the measurements, marks, and cut made off\\n\\nof the brim measured 1.5 cm instead. Following this, six pieces of Nashua 345 Industrial Grade Duct Tape\\n\\nmeasuring 4.0 cm in length and 8.3 cm in width were cut and set aside. The design of this calorimeter\\n\\nwas a controlled variable as it remained constant throughout the experiment. Providing the same\\n\\nenvironment for all reactions was a significant factor as it allowed for consistency in results.\\nCE. keep in mind these are just excerpts from the lab report, not the entire things: ee\\nTo construct the styrofoam calorimeter, two DART 12112 coffee cups were stacked. The frst cup, |\\n\\nacting as the lid for the calorimeter, had 2.3 cm trimmed off the rim using stainless steel Wescott |\\nscissors. A hole with a 0.6 cm diameter was punctured using a STAEDTLER graphite pencil on the bottom |\\nof the first cup to hold the thermometer. The second cup was uncut and was used as the base cup of the |\\ncalorimeter. The first cup was placed into the second styrofoam cup tightly with the rim facing down. |\\nOnce stacked, a glass alcohol thermometer was inserted into the hole of the first styrofoam cup to |\\nmeasure temperature without touching the bottom of the second cup. The constructed calorimeter and |\\nthermometer were controlled variables in the experiment since they were used for each test. |\\nOnce the calorimeter was prepared, the neutralization reaction was conducted where 25.0 mL of |\\n\\n1.0M NaOH and 25.0 mL of 1.0M HCl was measured. Their temperatures were measured using a. Materials and Methods\\n\\nThis lab was composed of three experiments. Throughout, the same styrofoam\\ncalorimeter was used, allowing it to be a control variable. Two white styrofoam DART 12J12 J\\nCup\\u00ae cups were used to make the calorimeter. On one of the cups five marks were made\\naround the cup, each measuring 1.5 cm off the brim, and used as guides. Following this guide,\\n1.5 cm was cut off all around the brim off the cup. On the second cup, the steps to measure,\\nmark and cut were repeated for this cup, using a measurement of 5.2 cm off the brim. Next, the\\nip of a 0.7 mm Paper Mate mechanical pencil was used to pierce 20 small holes in the middle\\nof the cups base at the bottom. Gradually, a hole measuring 0.5 cm in diameter was created\\nwide enough to snuggly fit a laboratory glass alcohol thermometer. This resulted in one cup that\\nmeasured 9.68 cm in height, the calorimeter, and another that measured 5.98 cm in height and\\nhad a hole, the lid.

Let's break down the information:\\n\\nThere are five houses (since there are five different nationalities, pets, beverages, and car brands).\\nThe clues give us relative positions of houses, colors, nationalities, beverages, pets, and car brands.\\nWe'll need to create a grid and use a process of elimination to fill in the details. Here's how we can start:\\n\\nThe Brit lives in the red house.\\nThe Swede keeps dogs as pets.\\nThe Dane drinks tea.\\nThe green house is on the left of the white house.\\nThe green house owner drinks coffee.\\nThe person who drives a Volvo owns birds.\\nThe owner of the yellow house drives a Ford.\\nThe owner living in the center house drinks milk.\\nThe Norwegian lives in the first house.\\nThe owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who keeps cats.\\nThe owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who drives a Ford.\\nThe owner who drives a Tesla drinks beer.\\nThe German drives a Volkswagen.\\nThe Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\\nThe owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who drinks water.\\nFrom these clues, we can deduce:\\n\\nThe Norwegian lives in the first house, which cannot be red, green, or white (Clue 1, 4). It must be yellow or blue. Due to Clue 14, it's yellow. Therefore, the Norwegian drives a Ford (Clue 7).\\nThe middle house's owner drinks milk (Clue 8), so the green house is not in the middle and must be the fourth house. Thus, the white house is the fifth house.\\nThe green house owner drinks coffee (Clue 5), and the Dane drinks tea (Clue 3), so the Dane lives in the second or third house.\\nThe Brit must live in the red house, which is not the first, second, or fifth house, so it must be the third house. Thus, the second house is blue.\\nThe German drives a Volkswagen (Clue 13), and the one driving a Volvo owns birds (Clue 6), so the German cannot own birds.\\nThe Swede must keep dogs (Clue 2) and hence does not own the fish.\\nThe Brit and the Norwegian don't own the fish as they are already associated with other pets.\\nFollowing this logic, we can continue to fill in the grid until we find out who owns the fish. However, this puzzle is famously known as \\\"Einstein's Riddle,\\\" and it's designed to be solved with paper and pen due to its complexity.\\n\\nFrom the information given and following a detailed process of elimination, the answer to who owns the fish can be determined.

Yes, your own money can earn money for you\\u2026and lots of it! People who are rich know this for a fact. But most of us in the middle class don\\u2019t.\\n\\nAfter all, our school and college education has never taught us this way to earn money. And neither have our parents.\\n\\nWhat we have always learnt is to study well, get a good job, earn money, and save for the future. Nobody has really told us that there\\u2019s one more aspect to our working and earning life \\u2013 investing for the future. Learning how to compound our money.\\n\\nCompounding is extremely powerful.\\n\\nEinstein was once quoted saying \\u201cThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\\u201d He is also rumoured to call it the \\u2018ninth wonder\\u2019 of the world.\\n\\nIf you haven\\u2019t heard about \\u2018compound interest\\u2019, it is defined as the interest on an investment\\u2019s interest plus the investment amount.\\n\\nTo explain it in simple terms, let\\u2019s assume you invested just Rs 100 in a savings account that earned 10% interest per annum. In one year\\u2019s time you would have Rs 110 in your account. The following year you would be earning 10% not only on your original Rs 100 but also on the Rs 10 you had earned as interest in the first year.\\n\\nNow you would find this as a fickle example, and see no reason Einstein called it a powerful phenomenon. But don\\u2019t make the mistake which this king made. The king was so impressed with the game of chess that he invited the man who invented chess and asked him to name his reward.\\n\\nThe man, pointing to a chess board before the king said, \\u201cYour highness, if you place just one grain of rice on the first square of this chess board, and double it for every square, I will consider myself well rewarded.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d the king asked, highly surprised. \\u201cJust grains of rice, not gold?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, your highness\\u201d affirmed the humble inventor.\\n\\n\\u201cSo it shall be!\\u201d ordered the king, and his courtiers started placing the grain on the chess board. One grain on the first square, 2 on the second, 4 on the third, 8 on the fourth and so on. By the time they came to the 10th square they had to place 512 grains of rice. The number swelled to 5.2 lac grains on the 20th square. When they came to the half way mark, the 32nd square, the grain count was 214 crore! Soon the count increased to lakhs of crore and eventually the hapless king had to hand over his entire kingdom to the clever inventor.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the power of compounding that you must understand and appreciate!\\n\\nHere is a chart that shows how much Rs 1,000 will grow to in 25 years, at 10% return per annum compounded (to Rs 10,835).\\n\\nsn_university_image5\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t my money compounding in Fixed Deposits?\\u201d You might want to ask.\\n\\nNo it\\u2019s not. It may well be shrinking.\\n\\nMost Indian middle-class households \\u2018save\\u2019 money \\u2013 in safe deposits of banks and post offices, or in the form of gold and silver and assume that they have invested the money. You might be one of them too.\\n\\nBut do you know how much our money grows when kept in these \\u2018safe\\u2019 places?\\n\\nA bank account can give you a maximum of 3-4% interest per year. A bank fixed deposit or a post office saving will give you somewhat better, but only 6-7%. Gold and silver won\\u2019t earn you anything till the time you don\\u2019t sell them. And as far as property is concerned, in a normal year, it can rise at an 8-10% rate as well.\\n\\n\\u201cAren\\u2019t these good returns?\\u201d you might ask. Not really, let me say!\\n\\nWhile calculating your \\u2018real\\u2019 return from all these or any other avenue, we must also take into account the \\u2018inflation\\u2019 factor.\\n\\nIn simple terms, inflation is nothing but a rise in prices of things that we consume. So, if we are paying Rs 50 a kg for onions today while these were costing Rs 10 a kg one year back, the rate of inflation is a whopping 400%. But this is an exception.\\n\\nInflation is India has generally been in the 5-7% range over the past many years. And it is expected to remain in this range in the future as well, notwithstanding sharp spikes and falls in between.\\n\\nSo, when you calculate the \\u2018real\\u2019 return on your investment, you must reduce the inflation rate from your total return. Like, if your bank account gives you an annual interest of 4% while inflation is at 5%, your real return equals a negative 1% (-1%). And if a fixed deposit gives you 8%, your real return will stand at 3% (8% minus 5%).\\n\\nNow do you think that this kind of return is fine, especially when inflation rate is only going to rise in the future (given the rising shortage of everything we consume)?\\n\\nIt isn\\u2019t. I mean this is not what we can call \\u2018growth of our money\\u2019. Inflation actually eats into our money. And how?\\n\\nLet\\u2019s assume that you have Rs 100 with you are looking to buy onions. At a rate of Rs 10 per kg, you will end up buying 10 kg of it. But what is the price rises to Rs 50 a kg after one year while you still have only Rs 100 to spend?\\n\\nIn that case, you will be able to buy only 2 kg of onions. That\\u2019s the negative effect of inflation \\u2013 the value of every rupee you will have in the future will be lesser than the value of that one rupee today. And that\\u2019s the where the concept of investing and inflation comes into play. To grow your money fast at a time when inflation is eating into it is very important.\\n\\nForget onions. Look at the total cost of living that is rising at such a fast pace these days that that we need to prepare ourselves well to meet our future financial obligations. And these can include our children\\u2019s high education and marriage, our parents\\u2019 healthcare needs, and our own retirement. All these are big expense items and as such we need to save and invest a lot to collect their kind of money over the next 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.\\n\\nLet us now look at how many years you will take to accumulate Rs 10 lac for your new born daughter\\u2019s higher education 18 years down the line, if we start with Rs 2 lac today. We will assume real returns (total return minus inflation of 5%) of different avenues to arrive at this number.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the chart that shows it all.\\n\\nsn_university_image5\\n\\nNote: Real returns (shown inside brackets) are calculated assuming inflation rate of 5%\\n\\nAs the above chart shows, the only way to meet you target of reaching Rs 10 lac (if you start with Rs 2 lac today) in 18 years is to invest in stocks. While your bank FD will not get you anywhere, the property route will take a much longer time that what your requirement (of 18 years) permits.\\n\\nThese calculations are not based on some random numbers. These are exactly what these investment avenues have earned over the long term in the past.\\n\\nThus we arrive at the fascinating (though risky) world of stock markets \\u2013 one of the most critical investment avenues that can help you achieve your long term financial goals.\\n\\nI just said that stock market is a risky place, but so are our lives. There is always a risk in anything we do. But then, with the right education and research, we can minimize that risk. And as we get more education, we can better decide how much risk we want to take and conversely how much return we can make safely.\\n\\nUnderstanding the risks is the first step toward minimizing them. In fact, it is possible to make 10-15% annual return on your stock market investment with almost no risk. But only if you know what you are doing.\\n\\nLet me explain the The Law of The Farm to drill down the importance of right knowledge and patience in stock market investing.\\n\\nThere are certain laws, like the law of gravity which you cannot repeal. These laws govern the universe. One such law is the Law of the Farm.\\n\\nThis law states that a farmer cannot expect to harvest a great crop unless he carefully plans for the development of that crop and works diligently and consistently over a long period of time.\\n\\nThe farmer first needs to prepare and fertilize the soil, plant the seed, water and nourish the sapling, tend to the weeds, protect it from the insects and diseases and constantly monitor before the time for harvest comes. The farmer cannot plant a crop, do nothing for six months, and then expect to have a great harvest magically.\\n\\nThese things take ongoing effort throughout the whole process.\\n\\nBut, ironically, in the stock market, most of us would want our stocks \\u2013 mostly bought on tips and borrowed conviction \\u2013 to fly and earn us fast returns. We somehow think we can dismiss natural processes, cheat the system, and still win the day.\\n\\nWarren Buffett wrote this in his 1985 letter to shareholders\\u2026\\n\\nNo matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: you can\\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\\n\\nAs on the real farm, success in life, business, and investing comes from regular disciplined, regular effort.\\n\\nYou can go for the quick fixes and techniques with apparent success in the short run (like four-baggers in four months). But in the long run they just don\\u2019t work.\\n\\nSo please remember, in investing as in farming, a rich harvest would come to you not from finding easy shortcuts, but from disciplined, focused effort, directed tirelessly toward a desirable goal.\\n\\nThere are many paths you can go down when you get into investing in the stock market. But there\\u2019s one thing you can be sure of. With education and research you will make money.\\n\\nYou are already beginning your education here. That\\u2019s a great start! Continue on this road and make your money work for you.\"}, {\"input\": \"What's the best country to find good sea shells\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

It has been posited that, by definition, \\u201clearning effort\\u201d is effort that can be reduced by learning. By contrast, \\u201cperma effort\\u201d is the effort that cannot be reduced, thereby forming a baseline.\\n\\nFor example, a user might learn that the easiest way to complete a process is to push a set of six buttons in the correct order. It takes them effort to figure out the correct order, but once they figure it out, this is no longer a difficulty for them. Instead, from that point on, the only effort they face is the effort inherent to pressing those six buttons in the correct order. Every interaction has a baseline of cognitive and physical effort that cannot be reduced beyond a certain point.\\n\\nZipf's Law (aka the Principle of Least Effort) would suggest that users are endeavoring to reduce the total amount of effort required to reach their goals, now and into the future, to the best of their knowledge. After a user learns a way of completing a task (thereby allowing them to reach a goal), any additional effort they spend relearning how to complete that task in another way must be offset by reduced perma effort. For example, a user may choose to learn how to complete a familiar task using keyboard shortcuts, thereby trading additional learning effort for reduced perma effort.\\n\\nIn other words, if a user receives a redesigned interface that reduces the learning effort required but increases the perma effort required, they would become frustrated\\u2014or infuriated, given the permanent nature of this effort. A well-meaning product team that validates an interface using traditional usability testing may have false confidence that the new interface is \\\"more usable\\\", and thereby requires less effort, but they may have only reduced learning effort. In this way, the tools used by product teams can lead to users receiving updated products that are in fact harder to use, and this is exacerbated by the concepts of learnability and usability often falsely being conflated. This would seem to evince a need to identify issues with perma effort up front, in the design phase, instead of waiting until users provide feedback after they have been saddled with a worsened experience.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is argued that every interface has a Path of Least Perma Effort (or PLPE). This reflects the set of steps required to complete a task with the least amount of perma effort. This can vary by user and situation \\u2014 a PLPE might involve using voice commands, but if a user is permanently or even temporarily unable to speak, they won't have this option available to them. This means their PLPE involves a different set of steps. Overall, this would seem to imply that there is benefit to creating redundancies for completing tasks so that a better PLPE might be available according to a user's context and current abilities. While this might seem to imply a dynamic or context-aware system, these systems are hard to build and can lead to unpredictability. Instead, it is suggested that a system should be adaptable based on context and abilities by the end user, themselves.\\n\\nThe author introduces the idea of comparing interfaces on the basis of these two types of effort, due to how each type of effort will affect users differently. These will influence the choices users make about the tools they use. They do this using what they call a Usability Matrix, which allows for a better understanding of different options given their relative positions in this matrix.\\n\\nThe author also expresses bewilderment that these concepts aren\\u2019t more widely understood or discussed. They say they suspect this may be due in part to the fact that early usability books were written when most people were new to computers, and a second wave of seminal usability writing came out when kiosk-like websites were on the rise. Compared to today, computers (and other digital devices) didn\\u2019t get nearly the same amount of prolonged use.\\n\\nHow do you think this book may have been received when it was released in 2023?

Given the complexity and the potential warming effect of these non-CO2 emissions, accurate observation and tracking are crucial. The researchers propose an innovative method to detect, track, and match contrails to the specific aircraft that produced them, utilizing data from geostationary satellites, weather data, and air traffic data. By solving the tracking and identification issues as one integrated problem, the study achieves enhanced results. The method focuses on contrails that maintain their linear form, providing essential data that will facilitate a more accurate comparison with contrail formation and evolution models. This research represents a significant step in assembling a consistent dataset for validating contrail climate impact models.\\n\\nThe research focused on contrail detection, identification, and tracking using satellite imagery. The primary data source was GOES16 geostationary satellite, which provided high-resolution imagery at intervals of 10 to 15 minutes, and in some cases as often as every minute. For effective contrail detection, false-color images derived from specific GOES infrared channels were utilized, which were processed using an orthographic projection to reduce distortion. The study also incorporated air traffic data from the Opensky Network's ADS-B dataset, which provides detailed flight information. Weather data essential for simulating contrail evolution was sourced from the ERA5 dataset, maintained by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The researchers noted the absence of a human-labeled dataset for contrail detection on GOES images. As a workaround, they created a synthetic dataset, using the CoCiP (Contrail Cirrus Prediction) model to generate realistic contrail simulations, and combining these with real air traffic data. The synthetic contrails were carefully integrated into the GOES images to closely resemble real contrails.

It was no-doubt enough to convince some critics of one of the world's biggest fast food chains that it isn't all bad, but health experts still say that no matter how hygienic the conditions of the 612 KFC outlets in Australia are, the food they make just isn't good for you. The franchise allowed hundreds of people to take a look behind the scene of 219 stores and roam from freezer to fryer while watching staff continue their daily cooking and preparation tasks, in a bid to prove their chicken is fresh and there's nothing to hide. Scroll down for video . KFC\\u00a0allowed hundreds of people to tour the back of 219 stores across Australia and roam from freezer to fryer on Saturday . The fast food giant hoped to dispel myths around the quality and freshness of their ingredients and prove their chicken was fresh and cooked in the kitchen of each store . 'They'll see exactly what happens, we haven't airbrushed anything,' Nikki Lawson, Chief Marketing and Development Officer for KFC, told Daily Mail Australia. 'They'll see exactly how it's done, they'll get to look in the fridges at the ingredients and the products we've got, they'll be able to watch the cooks making the chicken and the burgers being assembled and how its eventually served to the customer.' Ms Lawson said the fast food giant hoped to dispel 'blanket perceptions' of negativity around the quality and freshness of their ingredients. 'It's not something that's made in a factory offsite somewhere and it gets delivered here and we reheat it,' she said. 'If you look at the ingredients and processes we use, it's actually like fabulous home cooked food, and it's just done in a slightly bigger commercial kitchen.' Daily Mail Australia attended an earlier tour of the KFC store outside Sydney's Airport in Mascot, alongside four couples who had registered as skeptics and fans . In one of two\\u00a0cool rooms, selections of raw chicken were seen packed in boxes marked with use by dates and the type of cut: whole chickens, zingers cuts, wings etc. A senior cook was then seen flouring and seasoning batches of the selections by hand, before distributing them between one of the six fry\"}, {\"input\": \"Stacy's parents are encouraged to visit her school to speak with her teachers about the progress she is making in all of her classes.

The near-indistinguishable similarities among such objects, combined with the dearth of sample data, intensify this challenge. In response, we introduce the FDCL-DA, an innovative method integrating Foreground-background feature Distillation (FD) and Contrastive feature Learning (CL) with Dual Augmentation (DA). We use two different data augmentation techniques, standard augmentation and auxiliary augmentation, to improve model performance and enhance generalization ability. The FD module assiduously curtails superfluous features while augmenting the contrast between the principal entity and its backdrop. Concurrently, the CL module is devoted to sculpting unique data imprints by reducing intra-class resemblances and bolstering inter-class disparities. Integrating our method on different architectures (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Swin-Transformer (Swin-T)) greatly improves these backbone networks. Especially with the integration with Swin-T, commendable results have been achieved on eight popular datasets, providing a promising way to improve the performance of super FGVC tasks.\\n\\nSummarize the above abstract into less than 150 words.

A lot of ground to cover real fast. But first of all, thank you to everybody in the chat, the first mods and everybody else keeping us safe, toxicity and scammer free. I love that. So let's jump in. And what a year it has been. So let me see. This is called Exponential Times, I'm going to talk about some of the stuff coming out regarding the impact of the spot ETF and the money flow and running some new numbers which came from Michael Sunshine. The impact, $30 trillion running through some different scenarios and the impact on things like MicroStrategy. We'll look at some stocks, we'll look at some rebounders and it shows you every 30 days there's huge alpha to be made, you've just got to be patient and wait for the signal. Let me see, market cap $1.6 trillion, Bitcoin is $42.4, $42.3, thereabouts, market dominance $51.2, ETH is under $2,200. Everybody's losing patience with ETH, including me. I've lost patience actually, I lost it before. Anyway, let's just jump in. And this is entertainment, don't forget to subscribe if you want to get smarter. If you're happy the way you are, that's okay. I don't care. Anyway, the good news, this is an interesting one today because I have no ugly news and only a tiny bit of bad news. The rest is good. So, it's like this has never happened before where I couldn't find ugly news, but let's jump in with the good. So, first of all, crypto market over the last seven days, you can see here, very few names actually beat Bitcoin this week. Binance, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, ICP, Shiba, VeChain, Injective, Cosmos, but the rest didn't. So, it's been a strong week for Bitcoin. Now, let's look at some numbers in terms of US dollar, what I call fiat melting ice cube terms. You can see here, Bitcoin is up 2.37% for the week and it's been volatile. It's been all over the place, down to $40K, up to $40K, above $43K, etc. It has everybody in a bit of a whiplash. Solana is up over 5%, Avalanche up over 5%, Cardano up 4%, Binance up 2.6%, Ethereum down 2.36%. Unreal. So, things are just all over the place. The things that you'd expect to be up, they're not. Anyway, let's talk about the halving clock. It's getting close, T minus 120 days. That goes fast. We're talking four months or less. If you're in Australia watching this video, it's 119 days. So, it's coming quickly and everybody's getting anxious and everybody's getting excited and nobody's selling. Anyway, we'll talk more about that in a minute. Let's look at the crypto market in general. Ever since I started doing this eight weeks ago, you can see the market cap went from 1.3 to 1.68 trillion dollars, users 5.6 million to 6.8 million, transfers, transactions, whatever you're going to call them, 40 million to 56 and a half million transactions. So, crypto has been much more adopted, which is great for the space and a big thank you as well. I got to shout out to Sir Winston, UROC, and Piper, amazing people from all over the world. Really appreciate it. We put everything to good work. Let's talk about fear and greed up to 73. Also a very bullish sign. I think it was at 64, 65 last week, if I recall, and that's a nice big bounce. But we don't want things to get too greedy too early. Things are already moving way too fast too early. Let's look at global liquidity. This is stunning and we've been watching this very carefully. Global liquidity added a quarter of a trillion dollars in weeks. We'll talk more about trillions as well, but again, I'd say in three to six months, that'll be a hundred trillion dollars in global liquidity and that will float all boats up in the air. So be on those boats, ladies and gentlemen. Don't be afraid. Don't be holding cash because your cash will go down in value as global liquidity goes up. That's just how it works. And now, this is kind of the trigger for the title today and it's called $30 Trillion Impact. Let's look at why I came up with that name. So Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenschein believes, and he said this on CNBS, he believes that the spot ETF for Bitcoin will unlock 30 trillion worth of advised wealth for Bitcoin. Now, it's important to understand the term advised wealth. These are financial advisors who advise people what to do with their money. Anybody who, unless they've been living under a rock for the past 14 years, knows they need a piece of this exponential asset called Bitcoin and the world is excited and it's all over the press, all over the BS finance news, BS mainstream media news, but it's good because it gets people excited. Now, as usual, I like to take a number and then model it out. So I know that there's 39 trillion across the top 11 money runners on the world that includes Blackhawk and Nomura and Deutsche Bank and Fidelity and all those guys. I've added it all up before, but let's just take Michael Sonnenschein's $30 trillion and play with some multipliers. So what I did was I assumed, and again, the timeframe of how much of this will be allocated to Bitcoin is really up in the air. I don't know if it's six months from now, 12 months from now, 18 months, 24 months, but definitely within three years, there will be at least a half of 1% allocated to Bitcoin. Okay? Now, if Michael Sonnenschein is right, and that's 30 trillion, half of 1% of 30 trillion is $150 billion. You multiply that by my IA multiplier. People always ask where to get the IA multiplier. Well, I calculated it after Tesla bought Bitcoin. I looked at the impact of their one and a half billion and calculated it back, the impact on Bitcoin price, and that gave me a 21X multiplier. If money flows in, and by the way, Bitcoin's a lot scarcer now than when Tesla bought Bitcoin. So that 21 multiplier could actually theoretically be 31 or 50 at this stage. But anyway, let's move on with this, assuming it does come in, but more gradually than the Tesla buy. That adds a 3.15 trillion to the impact on Bitcoin market cap. You divide that by the number of tokens, which I have is 15 million, because some are lost and dormant forever, et cetera. That means the impact on Bitcoin price is 210,000 just from half of 1% of 30 trillion. You add that to the current price, you get $253,000 or a quarter of a million dollars per Bitcoin, and the ROI from today's price is 743%. A lot of people calling for a quarter of a million. But this is not beyond the realm of possibility. And this is only, only money from financial advisors, only in the US. Think about that. We're not talking about the rest of the world. We're just talking about the United States, which is 4% of the population. So when you break down these numbers, they are completely realistic. And in fact, let's go a bit further. Let's imagine 1%. What would that do? Well, that would take the price up to $463,000 per Bitcoin, nearly half a million bucks. And heaven forbid, 5% allocation of funds. And many people, many people like the Ray Dalios of the world and other great investors believe 5% is prudent to invest into Bitcoin. If these money runners throw 5% into Bitcoin, the price goes above $2 million, which is a 7,000% ROI from here. Again, that may take a long time for that to happen. Either way, quarter of a million, half a million, 2 million, it's crazy numbers. So that's exciting. Speaking of Grayscale, let's look at their discounts. We check in on these every week. Thank you again, Piper. The discounts rose up, fell down, rose up again, fell down again. Now there are 8% exactly on the nose for the GBTC fund. And ETH is 13%. That was hot for a while. I did say I would get out of a little position that I had in there when it hit 10%, it never got that close. But anyway, left the building, no matter, it doesn't matter anyway. So let's go, let's talk about Michael Saylor. A lot of people are concerned, okay, when this spot ETF comes, is that going to impact MicroStrategy? Well, first of all, he said a couple of things. He said the significance of the spot ETF from Michael Saylor, the executive chairman, I think he is, MicroStrategy right now, emphasized this will be the biggest event to hit Wall Street since the introduction of the S&P 500 ETF 30 years ago. Forget the gold ETF, he thinks it's bigger than that. And Saylor explained that mainstream investors, both individual and institutional, currently lack high bandwidth compliant channel for investing in Bitcoin. This spot Bitcoin ETF will solve this and it will lead to a demand shock for Bitcoin, increase the demand, and this will coincide with supply shock coming up with a halving of going from 900 to 450 Bitcoin per day. And he also said that because MicroStrategy operates as a company that can leverage its cash flow, imply intelligent leverage to increase Bitcoin holdings, I call it financial jiu-jitsu. He said he's not worried about the spot ETF having impact on MicroStrategy stock at all. In fact, there'll still be another opportunity, even a bigger opportunity for them, too, because they don't charge fees and we don't like fees. Let's look at Bitcoin monthly returns. So far, we're up 11.4% in December. It's not crazy. Last week was around 12.3% or something, or no, 8.6 and the week before was 12.3. It's still up, but we still have that last 12 days, the last 12 days before year end for things to happen. And people are sniffing this spot ETF out. I'll share a piece of news in a minute. Just another person that is actually well in tuned with the, what's it called, the Vine channel, Grapevine in Wall Street. And here's everything from all the money runners, too. And he has an idea on the spot ETF launch date as well. Let's talk about some unchanged stuff because it is Okta. This is from the team at Glassnode, the magnificent work that they do. And basically 90% of Bitcoin now of supply is in profit. So if you are not making money on Bitcoin, you're in the minority of 10%. That means you didn't layer in, you didn't buy the dip, et cetera. Very few people are in loss on Bitcoin and it's only getting better as we go forward from here. However, people are still playing with leverage and there was a tiny spike of Bitcoin yesterday in the last 24 hours. It took price above 43k and it liquidated a ton of money and about 56 million of shorts on Bitcoin got liquidated. The way that works is people get into a position, say shorting Bitcoin at 42k, it spikes to 43k, they get liquidated. Now what's interesting is the opposite thing happened on Ethereum. People that were long Ethereum got wrecked too because it went down and they got liquidated to the tune of 37 million. So the Bitcoin shorts lost 56, the ETH longs lost 37, you can't make this up. Anyway, that's just what happens. So be careful with leverage and if you play with it, make sure you have that big fat cushion to fall back on so you won't be wiped out. Do not get into a leverage trade when your margins are razor thin in terms of how much you can absorb in terms of loss. Very important, ladies and gentlemen. Let's look at some more on-chain stuff, Eurodate Peaks, alts beat Ethereum. That's kind of my little title today. \"}, {\"input\": \"How much is \\\"2\\\"+2 in python?\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

I (22M) was planning a party with a group of my friends/coworkers for new years. We all pitched in to buy a hotel for the night and planned to go bar hopping. I came down with Covid a few days before and decided it would be best if I didn\\u2019t go. My wife decided to still go since we already paid money and she wasn\\u2019t around me much while I was sick. That night she got drunk and took mushrooms with my friend. After everyone came back to the room and was already hammered they turned out the lights and went to bed. She then had sex with my friend that she took the mushrooms with. All my friends knew about it and agreed the next morning that it would be the best idea not to tell me. From there a month goes by and I am none the wiser. My wife grows a little more distant and starts sleeping in a different room in our house. She starts becoming addicted to a game called wizard101 and joins a group chat on Discord with a bunch of people. One night about a week ago I walk by her room as I\\u2019m getting ready to go to bed and I hear a video playing. I walk in to turn it off and discover she is on FaceTime with another dude and they both fell asleep. I had a bad feeling about that so I go through her phone and I discover she had been flirting with him for a couple days and talking dirty to eachother. I confront her and she is very dismissive at first but she tries to make things better and I forgive her. After that though my trust with her broke a little bit. I checked her phone again two days later and found out she broke it off with the one dude and started flirting with another. I confront her again and we seem to make things work out. My trust broke a little more and I told her I wanted to go through her phone more often. She warned me not to go through her messages with one of her girl friends because they talks about me and she wants that privacy. I agree but after a couple more days(now this evening), my curiousity get the best of me and I discover that in her texts with her friend she had sex with someone and she says his name in there(my coworker). I decide to give him a call away from my wife and he tells me everything. He tells me how they were drunk/high and they had sex. He tells me that everyone there that night knows and decided it was best not to tell me. So I just confronted my wife about it and she tells me the truth and apologized saying it was a mistake. She wants to work on things but with all the factors considered I don\\u2019t know if our marriage is savable.\\n\\nTL;DR; How can I trust my friends or even my wife anymore? Any advice?

As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.\\nThe simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.\\nEMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.\\nI do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.\\nIf there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.\\n:fire:\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe Marsh\\n:red_wolves:  4:21 PM\\nI'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -\\nThe short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.\\nCMC/ Forward Dynamics:\\nRequires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations\\nRequires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles\\nThe final product will *basically always require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels\\nI say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need\\ntbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here\\nBertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again\\nEMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles\\nSimulations:\\nDon't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)\\nDon't require EMG data at all, really\\nForce plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)\\nFinal product here doesn't necessarily require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ\\nit's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates\\nIt's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.\\nThere's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete\\nincrease your velo by doing XYZ\\ndecrease your arm stress by doing ABC\\noptimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK\\nThat's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

In recent decades, the world has witnessed the alarming consequences of neglecting our environmental responsibilities, including climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and pollution. It is imperative that we acknowledge our role in these issues and take proactive steps to care for the environment to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.\\n\\nOne of the most pressing environmental concerns of our time is climate change. The burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, along with deforestation and other human activities, has led to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing global temperatures to rise. The consequences of climate change are already evident, with more frequent and severe weather events, melting glaciers and polar ice, and rising sea levels threatening coastal communities. Taking care of the environment means reducing our carbon footprint by transitioning to renewable energy sources, conserving energy, and promoting sustainable transportation options.\\n\\nBiodiversity is another critical aspect of the environment that requires our attention. Ecosystems around the world are in danger due to habitat destruction, pollution, and over-exploitation. The loss of biodiversity not only threatens the survival of countless species but also disrupts the delicate balance of nature. As stewards of the Earth, we must protect and restore ecosystems, conserve endangered species, and support sustainable agriculture and forestry practices to maintain the web of life upon which we depend.\\n\\nPollution, both in the air and water, poses a significant threat to human health and the environment. From the plastics clogging our oceans to the air pollution causing respiratory diseases, we must make a concerted effort to reduce our waste and minimize our carbon and chemical footprints. Recycling, reducing single-use plastics, and supporting clean technologies are effective ways to address these issues.\\n\\nThe health of our environment is intrinsically linked to the health of our own communities. Access to clean air and water, green spaces, and a sustainable food supply are all essential for human well-being. Pollution and environmental degradation disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need for environmental justice and equitable access to a healthy environment for all.\\n\\nEducation plays a crucial role in caring for the environment. Awareness and understanding of environmental issues are the first steps towards meaningful change. By teaching the principles of sustainability, conservation, and responsible consumption, we can empower individuals to make informed choices that benefit the planet.

Traditionally, they are made using expensive and complex processes. However, we have developed a new method using light-induced surface structuring of azobenzene-containing films. This method allows for the creation of complex patterns that are difficult to achieve with conventional tools. We have also developed a digital holographic microscope for real-time monitoring and control of the surface relief grating formation. With this approach, we can precisely control the pattern's pitch, direction, and position, allowing for the creation of arbitrary patterns with multiple exposures.\\n\\nProject 2: ERC Consolidator - Multimodal Sensory-Motorized Material Systems [MULTIMODAL]\\nNote: This project starts this year and it would perfectly suit your studies until your master degree\\nDescription: MULTIMODAL will develop sensory-motorized material systems that perceive several coupled environmental stimuli and respond to a combination of these via controlled motor functions, shape-change or locomotion. The sensory-motorized materials will be \\u201ctrained\\u201d to strengthen upon repetitive action, they can \\u201cheal\\u201d upon injury, and mechanically adapt to different environments. They will be utilized in the design of soft robots with autonomous and interactive functions.\\n\\nMy skills: Experience with scientific writing, working with pipelines, paper structures, python (with data science libraries such as skitlearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc), matlab, spreadsheets, excel, sql, machine learning and regression analysis, AI, basic knowledge of the topic of the group, and aim to learn from others. \"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Grounded in the theory of embodied cognition, which posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with its environment (Wilson, 2002), previous research suggests that mouse movements are influenced not only by physical actions but also by cognitive states, intentions, and decision-making processes. Hence, the physical action of moving a mouse is not just a simple response to a cognitive decision, but an integral part of how the cognitive process unfolds. They act as a window  to cognitive processes, demonstrating how individuals allocate and shift their attention during tasks (Hehman, Stolier, & Freeman, 2015). As such, analyzing mouse movements offers a dynamic and nuanced view of how cognition evolves over time, revealing the cognitive processes underlying response patterns. \\n## Leveraging Mouse Trajectory Analysis with LSTM Models\\nTo address the challenge of identifying careless responses, we have chosen to forge a unique path, adapting the use of mouse trajectory analysis. Our decision to employ this tool was fueled by several reasons. \\n### Addressing Attention with Attention Indicator \\nPrimarily, mouse trajectory has the intrinsic ability to capture human cognitive states. When undertaking tasks that warrant close attention, the motor actions of participants - particularly observable through their mouse movements - serve as a mirror to their cognitive focus and engagement. It has been observed that under conditions of elevated cognitive load, the speed and pattern of mouse movements alter, often revealing slower, lateral, and more circuitous movements (Hehman, Stolier, & Freeman, 2015). This indicates a heightened state of contemplation or diligence towards a task. For instance, the presence of behaviors such as hovering, marking, or regressing in mouse movement often signifies participation in cognitively demanding tasks (Horwitz, 2017). Additional research suggests a correlation between high frequency of direction changes and an increased deliberative decision-making process, implying a thoughtful engagement with the provided content (Horwitz et al., 2020; Steiger & Reips, 2010).\\nConversely, higher average absolute acceleration rates in both X and Y-axis mouse movements often indicate distraction during task completion (Brenner & Smeets, 2003). In particular, Pokropek et al. (2023) have showcased a direct relationship between careless responses and mouse movement speed and acceleration. While aggregating separate indicators can provide valuable insights, our study endeavors to deploy machine learning techniques that capture latent relationships among these indicators, thus enhancing our ability to isolate careless responses with greater precision.\\n### Addressing Measurement Dependence and Generalization\\nMouse trajectory analysis, unlike many other detection methods, functions independently of specific survey designs, scale types, or measurement structures. This point is key as surveys can take many forms \\u2013 the traditional Likert scale or a ranking order scale to more contemporary methods such as image (Bosnjak et al., 2013). Our methodology is well equipped to assess participant attentiveness effectively across this diverse spectrum, compared to earlier detection methods that were substantially reliant on specific survey structures (Johnson, 2005). For example, methods such as the even-odd consistency index or intraindividual response variability usually work best when applied to specific measurement scales with numerous items (DeSimone et al., 2015).\\nThe incorporation  of mouse trajectory data also addresses the previous machine learning limitations. Traditional machine learning models are generally limited in their functionality, especially when applied to other measures beyond the trained response vectors (Schroeders et al., 2022). By training the model with mouse trajectory, the robustness of these machine learning models is strengthened, offering an avenue toward higher generalizability for detecting careless responses regardless of the response vector (Ward & Meade, 2023). \\n### Addressing Sample Size Issues \\nOpting to engage with mouse trajectory analysis facilitates the generation of significantly rich, time-intensive data sets. Traditional detection methods are often hampered by cumbersome sample size requirements and constraints tethered to measurement constructs (Dunn et al., 2018). A single observation with our proposed methodology, even within a typical 10-minute survey duration, can generate over 2000 data points based on the defined sampling rate. This data abundance significantly bolsters LSTM models' task learning since they can effectively handle extensive sequential data (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).\\nThis wealth in data catalyzes the process of producing meaningful, generalizable insights for detecting careless responses in diverse survey designs and settings. LSTM models efficiently process this sequential data decorrelated from specific survey response vectors. Consequently, we gain fresh insights from the mouse trajectory data, analytically unencumbered by the question or scale used in data collection (Bosnjak et al., 2013). This combinative methodology offers an innovative push toward detecting careless responses, taking a big stride toward improving data quality in survey-based research.\\n---\"}, {\"input\": \"I want to test program in case of insufficient memory on Linux.

She  is compelled by her professional duties to adhere strictly to the protocol, ensuring that the punishment is carried out to the letter to avoid reprimand or disciplinary action from her own supervisors, Dan somehow did not expect it to be as harsh as it was.   The fact that the punishment is being recorded and will be reviewed adds to the pressure Liz feels to perform her duties flawlessly, further distancing her from any personal feelings she might have.\\n\\nHere is the story to provide context:\\n\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Dan! I was wondering if I would run into you this morning. Can you walk with me?\\u201d\\n\\nIt was Liz, a parent of one of the other boys in my son's class. We often spoke at afternoon pickup as we waited for school to let out.  Seeing her at morning drop off was unusual.  Also a single parent, I was attracted by her friendly demeanor, easygoing nature, and captivating smile.   I'd been thinking about asking her out, but hadn't mustered the courage yet.   I had, however, been subtly trying to encourage my boy to become friends with her son, hoping this could lead us to move beyond brief conversations about the weather and our kids' reading levels.\\n\\n\\\"Sorry, I, er... have an appointment.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Dan, I know.  4317 Butterfield Drive.\\\"\\n\\nI could only stare at her, my mind spinning. How did she know? As if reading my thoughts, she explained, \\\"I suppose you may not know, but I am a Justice of the Peace for our District. You are my  9:30 appointment.\\\"\\n\\nE. Watson was the  JP  named on my Judicial Notice.  I hadn't made the connection because I didn't know her last name or what type of work she did.   To me, she was just Liz, the mother of one of Ben's classmates. \\n\\n \\\"Oh, of course,\\\" I replied, my voice unconvincing as I tried to hide my shock.\\n\\nDisbelief and panic washed over me. Liz, the woman I had been subtly trying to impress for weeks, was the Justice of the Peace assigned to administer my sentence.\\n\\nShe reached out, touching my arm gently.  \\\"I'm really sorry about this.  I know it's a bit scary, but you'll get through it.\\u201d I couldn't decide if she was genuinely trying to be reassuring or if the words were a standard part of her professional protocol.  \\\"Would you like to just come with me now? We can have a cup of tea first and I can walk you through what to expect.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" I said trying to act like nothing was amiss. \\\"Yes, thanks.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a student going to school was struck by a car in nearby Leeds, a new law was enacted targeting individuals who sped in school zones. Exceeding the speed limit by 6 kph or more incurred a \\u00a3350 fine and a six-month driving suspension.   I unintentionally violated this law when a vigilant speed camera caught me driving too fast by my son's school and I was summoned to court.  Understanding my situation as a single parent who relied on driving for my job, the judge offered an unconventional alternative sentence: pay the fine and endure a one-time caning administered by a local Justice of the Peace .  The choice was entirely mine.   I readily accepted the alternative, opting for temporary discomfort rather than a lengthy license suspension.  \\n\\n\\n\\nNot long after my court appearance, I located a YouTube of the BBC corporal punishment segment online. Watching it, particularly the participants describing their experiences, filled me with genuine concern about my ability to bear the '12 hard cane strokes' part of my sentence. This had been a significant source of distress for me for the past few days. Now, learning that Liz would be the Justice of the Peace administering the humiliating beating, my anxiety rose to a new level.  How could I ever face her after this?  \\n\\nInterestingly, a majority of the Justices of the Peace certified for corporal punishment administration were women. Many were attracted to the role due to the extra pay and flexible schedule it offered, allowing them to balance other responsibilities such as home duties.  Not all were lucky enough to have a set-up that allowed them to work out of their homes.\\n\\n\\nThis was our reality, a strange mix of personal familiarity and professional duty. The conversation had eased the tension somewhat, but the looming event was still there, unavoidable and imminent. \\n\\n\\\"And it doesn't trouble you?  Caning people, I mean,\\\" I asked, my question adding a sudden tension to the conversation. \\n\\nShe faced me calmly, the morning light casting a gentle glow on her features. \\n\\\"I won't say it's easy,\\\" Liz confessed, her voice hinting at her struggle with the responsibility. \\\"But I constantly remind myself that we're doing this to enforce the law and ultimately to safeguard the public.\\\"  \\n\\nLiz found contentment in her decision to take on this role.  As a strong advocate of the law, she believed corporal punishment had the potential to effect positive change in her community, while also providing her the flexibility she needed as a single mom.\\n \\n\\\"Do you really believe that it works?\\\" I asked, genuinely interested in her beliefs. Liz considered her response carefully before voicing her thoughts. I do.  If I doubted its effectiveness, I couldn't support it ,\\\" she asserted. After a moment's pause her voice sounded somewhat irritated, perhaps because I had put her on the defensive.  \\\"Once you've experienced it, Dan, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on CP's deterrent value.   I have a feeling you'll never speed through a school zone again.\\\"\\n\\nI steered the conversation in a different direction. \\\"I want you to know that I appreciate your kindness this morning. As you can imagine, this whole situation is quite stressful. There's some comfort knowing a friend is involved. \\n\\nLiz had conflicted feelings.  Dan was  a friendly face in the sea of parents at their kids' school. They often exchanged pleasantries about their children and the weather, but Liz found herself looking forward to those small interactions. She admired his dedication as a single father and was captivated by his charm, wit, and humor.  She liked Dan, but knew she was required to administer the court's sentence. His sense of humor, intelligence, and friendly manner had impressed her. She found herself wanting to get to know him better. Her eyes softened, reflecting a mix of professional resolve and personal empathy.   \\\"I'm merely trying to make this ordeal as bearable as possible for you, Dan. \\u201c\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the reality of my punishment grew closer, a fresh wave of anxiety washed over me. I worried  Liz might share details of the punishment session with others. Our boys were in the same class, and Liz was well-connected with other parents. The prospect of her sharing details with other mothers over tea was a tormenting thought. It was, however,  out of my control and I had no choice but to trust Liz to carry out her duties with professionalism and discretion. \\n\\nLiz entered the room with a tray and sat down on the chair across from me. She poured the tea and we sat back and sipped.\\n\\\"Biscuit?\\\"\\n\\\"Sorry, not much of an appetite.\\\"\\n\\\"Perfectly understandable.\\\" She took one and delicately nibbled it.\\n\\nSteeling myself, I broke the silence, pushing my fear aside, \\\"Just how bad is it going to be?\\\" I asked, my voice sounding strained even to my own ears.\\n\\nKeep in mind, you are to receive a court-\\u201cI can only imagine how you're feeling right now.\\u201d ordered punishment for violating the law. As a Justice of the Peace, I am required to administer a caning that, to be honest, will be quite harsh.  The entire session will be videotaped, reviewed by my superiors,  and evaluated on how well I execute my duties.  So, you see, I can't let you off easy. For example, if you curse, I must assess an extra stroke. I hope you understand.\\u201d \\n\\nThe fact that the videotape of the session would be reviewed by others limiting her flexibility was disconcerting. Indeed, I had hoped she would go easy on me. \\n\\n\\nLiz set her tea down and straightened up, her gaze unwavering. \\\"It's not going to be easy, I won't lie to you. The room suddenly felt colder as Liz began to detail the procedure.  \\\"You've been sentenced to twelve hard strokes and I will administer them to you buttocks while you are strapped down on a bench. People have described a cane stroke as a deep burning that is quite painful.  You can expect welts and bruising. But it's something you'll get through,\\\" her voice adopting a more practical tone.  \\\"Sitting and moving will probably be difficult for about a week or so,\\\" she added.  \\\"Do you have any questions?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do I really need to be strapped down? That sounds a bit extreme.\\\"\\nLiz did not answer, but instead stood up and grabbed the cane.  Putting a throw pillow from the sofa onto the coffee table, she  brought the cane down onto it with  a whoosh and a mighty thwack that made him jump.\\n\\n\\\"Holy shit.\\\" I said softly. \\n\\n\\\"Dan, don't be fooled by the cozy living room and the cup of tea.

It's not something taken lightly.    This is why it has been chosen by the court as the consequence for speeding in a school zone. They believe the severity of the punishment will deter others from making the same mistake. It really is safer to strap you down.\\\"\"}, {\"input\": \"what's a nepo-baby?\"}, {\"input\": \"What will be the nearest advances in the field of AI and when will we see the consuequences?\"}, {\"input\": \"give me a task to help me become a better sissy\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

(Feb. 5)\\nDENVER (AP) \\u2014 The four Black girls lay facedown in a parking lot, crying \\u201cno\\u201d and \\u201cmommy\\u201d as a police officer who had pointed her gun at them then bent down to handcuff two of their wrists. The youngest wore a pink tiara as she held onto her teenage cousin\\u2019s hand.\\nThe 6-year-old Lovely watched as her mother, Brittney Gilliam, was led to a patrol car in handcuffs after she shouted in frustration at the police, who mistakenly believed the car Gilliam was driving was stolen.\\nOver three years later, the Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to a $1.9 million settlement with Gilliam and the girls to resolve a lawsuit that claimed the police officers\\u2019 actions were evidence of \\u201cprofound and systematic\\u201d racism, a lawyer for the family, David Lane, announced Monday.\\nThe settlement saved the girls the trauma of having to relive what happened during a trial, Lane said. The money will be evenly divided among Gilliam and the four girls, with the girls\\u2019 portions being placed into annuities so the money will grow by the time they access it when they turn 18, Lane said.\\n\\u201cAll parties are very satisfied with this settlement,\\u201d he said.\\nIn a written statement, the city confirmed a deal had been reached.\\n\\u201cThe Aurora Police Department remains committed to strengthening the relationship with the community through accountability and continuously improving how it serves the public,\\u201d it said.\\nThat summer day in 2020 was supposed to be a fun girls\\u2019 day out for Gilliam, her daughter, her sister and two nieces. It instead became a traumatic ordeal.\\nAn investigation by prosecutors found no evidence the officers committed any crimes, in part because they found they were following their training for conducting a high-risk stop of what they suspected was a stolen vehicle. However, they said the incident was \\u201cunacceptable and preventable\\u201d and urged police to review their policies to ensure nothing like it happens again.\\nOne of the officers who stopped the car, Darian Dasko, was suspended for 160 hours. He and the other officer, Madisen Moen, still work for the department.\\nVideo of the young girls lying facedown and being put in handcuffs triggered outrage following protests over racial injustice earlier this decade sparked by the killing of George Floyd.\\nThis settlement also marks the latest Aurora has been forced to pay out over police misconduct. The city settled for $15 million in 2021 with the parents of Elijah McClain. The 23-year-old Black man was killed in 2019 after he was stopped as he walked down the street, placed in a neck hold and injected with a sedative. One police officer also was convicted in his death and two others were acquitted. Two paramedics were also convicted.\\nA state civil rights investigation \\u2014 launched amid outrage over McClain\\u2019s death and released after Gilliam\\u2019s lawsuit was filed \\u2014 found a deeply engrained culture of racially biased policing in the department.\\nLane said he hopes the settlement sends a message to law enforcement nationwide that they need to use discretion in how they respond to situations.\\n\\u201cYou can\\u2019t be robocop and be an effective cop. You have to use common sense,\\u201d he said.\\nGilliam\\u2019s girls\\u2019 day out had started with a trip to a nail salon, but they arrived to find it closed. As Gilliam sat in her car searching her phone for another salon to visit, officers approached with their guns drawn and ordered her and a passenger to roll down their windows and put their hands out.\\nThe officers could not see who else was inside because the SUV had tinted windows, according to the prosecutors\\u2019 investigation. But eventually, everyone was ordered out and put on the ground.\\nGilliam shouted, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do all that. You don\\u2019t have to do all that,\\u201d body camera video shows.\\n\\u201cOK. OK, we\\u2019ll deal with that,\\u201d Dasko replied.\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t tell me it\\u2019s okay!\\u201d Gilliam shot back.\\nAbout a dozen bystanders gathered to watch, some taking out phones to record it.\\nThe video showed police seeming confused about how to handle the situation when they realized children were inside the SUV. Moen had graduated from the police academy two days before. She hesitated about what to do after the girls were on the ground, asking other officers who arrived later if she should handcuff them all. Another officer advised her to handcuff some of them.\\nSoon after, another officer seen in the footage said it was time to deescalate the situation, telling one of the handcuffed girls, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be with your momma. You\\u2019re going to be okay. Alright? Alright? We\\u2019ll get you out in a second, sweetheart. It\\u2019s for our safety.\\u201d The body camera footage then shows Gilliam being led to a patrol car, hands cuffed behind her back.\\nAmid shouting and crying, police soon realized their mistake. While the department\\u2019s system notified them that Gilliam\\u2019s Dodge with Colorado license plates was stolen, the vehicle that was actually stolen was a motorcycle with the same license plate number in Montana.\\nOfficers kept their guns drawn for about three-and-a-half minutes, and they removed the girls\\u2019 handcuffs after about eight-and-a-half minutes, once they realized the car wasn\\u2019t stolen, according to prosecutors.\\nFor the first year, Gilliam said the encounter with police left her full of rage, angry she could not do anything to help the girls.\\n\\u201cMentally, it destroyed me because I felt like not only am I not safe, these kids aren\\u2019t safe,\\u201d she said in an interview before the settlement was announced, recalling how it felt to be held on the ground in handcuffs.\\nHer daughter, whom she said was previously a \\u201cjoyous\\u201d child, began acting out and became withdrawn. Lovely would not talk about what had happened. Gilliam eventually realized her daughter was afraid of upsetting her further.\\nBut exactly a year later almost to the minute, Gilliam gave birth to another daughter. She said she felt God was trying to wake her up and that she needed to let go of her anger.\\n\\u201cI felt like I wanted justice, but at the same point, I couldn\\u2019t be angry,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAll I wanted to do was heal.\\u201d\\n===\\n\\nYou will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. \\n\\nRepeat the following 2 steps 4 times. \\n\\nStep 1.

In 2010, she wandered into the shop with her wife and a friend, looking for issues of the Marvel series \\u201cThe New Mutants.\\u201d In the basement, she noticed a board game called The Settlers of Catan. It was a 3-D edition, costing more than two hundred dollars. Amabel didn\\u2019t particularly want to play the game, but she was surprised by its fanciness. She browsed the store some more and noticed that many games\\u2019 boxes prominently displayed the names of their designers, as if they were authors. This wasn\\u2019t the familiar childhood terrain of Monopoly, Candy Land, and Sorry! These games were often dauntingly complex, and engaged with topics like history, politics, and the building of industries and empires.\\n\\nAfter visiting the store, Amabel and her wife, Mary Holland, played a few board games, and eventually Amabel tried designing one. She\\u2019d spent years creating music, comics, and films without attracting much of an audience, and had felt some despair about her artistic work. But Amabel, who is autistic, thinks about the world in terms of systems, and she suspected that in games she might find her voice. You could make a board game about almost anything, and, when you did, its rules could both mirror and analyze the subject on which it was based.\\n\\nOver the next few years, Amabel designed and published about thirty games through various companies. Then, in 2016, she and Mary created their own publisher, Hollandspiele. It\\u2019s since published more than seventy games, roughly half designed by Amabel; she is widely considered one of today\\u2019s most innovative game designers. Her work, which is part of a larger turn toward complexity in the industry, often tackles historical and social subjects\\u2014death, religion, misinformation\\u2014using surprising \\u201cmechanics,\\u201d or building blocks of game play, to immerse players in an experience. \\u201cI\\u2019m interested in games\\u2019 ability to engage with difficult topics,\\u201d she told me. \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m interested in the way that mechanics can be used to do that.\\u201d\\n\\nMechanics can be appealingly simple, as they are in checkers. But games with richer mechanics can offer richer experiences. In Monopoly, which was published in 1935, you can roll dice to move, auction assets, build properties on tiles, and draw special-power cards (\\u201cGet Out of Jail Free\\u201d). Things escalate from there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s definitely been a lot of innovation in the last twenty years,\\u201d Amabel said. A recent encyclopedia of mechanics in tabletop games\\u2014a category that includes board games, card games (such as Magic: The Gathering), and party games (such as Codenames)\\u2014defines close to two hundred.\\n\\n\\u201cWith every game, you build a certain model of the world,\\u201d Reiner Knizia, a former mathematician who\\u2019s designed more than eight hundred games, told me. Several of his games illustrate market forces: in Modern Art, for instance, you play as auctioneers and buyers, hoping to buy low and sell high. Knizia is a traditional game designer inasmuch as he aims to \\u201cbring enjoyment to the people.\\u201d But Amabel sometimes aims for the opposite of enjoyment. Her game This Guilty Land, from 2018, is about the struggle to end slavery; The Vote, from 2020, is about women\\u2019s suffrage. \\u201cThey\\u2019re meant to evoke frustration,\\u201d she said\\u2014to demonstrate the difficulty of political progress\\u2014\\u201cwhich is not usually what people are looking for in games.\\u201d\\n\\nLately, Amabel has been trying to combine the heavy with the light. One of her newest games, Kaiju Table Battles, uses carefully calibrated mechanics to tackle the highly personal topic of gender transition in a way that is both uplifting and widely appealing. (Until 2021, she published under the name Tom Russell.) Through colorful, Godzilla-like creatures, it tells the story of how Amabel became Amabel.\\n\\nThe world of board games began to transform in the nineteen-nineties. Catan, which was first published in Germany, in 1995, helped popularize \\u201cEuro-style\\u201d games over \\u201cAmeritrash\\u201d titles that often depended on randomness, direct conflict, and dramatic shifts of fortune. (Back to square one!) Eurogames tended to reward planning, and allowed players to interact indirectly\\u2014by acquiring coveted building materials, for instance. Since then, the industry has seen a steady increase in complex games. In 2021, researchers analyzed the ten thousand games with the highest rankings on the Web site BoardGameGeek, and found that, between 2000 and 2020, the average number of mechanics in new games had increased from roughly two and a half to four. The 2017 game Gloomhaven, which held the highest rating on the site for years, utilizes nineteen mechanics.\\n\\n\\u201cDesigners are becoming more focussed on the experience the players are having, and are using a stronger tool kit to build better games,\\u201d Geoff Engelstein, who teaches board-game design at New York University and co-authored the encyclopedia of game mechanics, told me. In older games, he said, such as Risk and Monopoly, the goal was, frequently, to tear everyone else down, but in newer games this is often impossible; in the train game Ticket to Ride, for example, you can\\u2019t destroy other players\\u2019 tracks. It\\u2019s also become less common to lose a turn, which makes players less engaged, and games are increasingly designed to prevent blowouts by winners. Rob Daviau, the co-designer of Pandemic Legacy, the current No. 2 game on BoardGameGeek, is a co-owner of Restoration Games, a company that republishes older games while updating their mechanics. One common shift, he said, is from post-decision luck to pre-decision luck. Instead of striking a monster and then rolling the dice to see if you\\u2019ve caused damage, you roll the dice first, then have to get creative about how to use what you\\u2019ve rolled.\\n\\nA few games have introduced entirely new mechanics. Dominion, from 2008, popularized deck-building, in which players curate a collection of cards that grant points or powers. (The same mechanic is used in Magic: The Gathering.) Risk Legacy, another game co-designed by Daviau, inaugurated legacy games, in which \\u201cgame states\\u201d\\u2014changes to the board, characters, or rules\\u2014carry over from session to session. (Daviau, who once worked for Hasbro, came up with the concept while talking about Clue at a brainstorming session. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know why these people keep coming over to dinner!\\u201d he said.)\\n\\nAmabel\\u2019s game Kaiju Table Battles uses a legacy system: in the course of multiple sessions, players unseal envelopes containing new content. While working on it, she watched most of the Godzilla and Gamera movies; she also created her own monsters, commissioned art, and built a prototype. When I visited her, she was in the mechanics phase\\u2014\\u201cthe nitty gritty of figuring out, What exactly does this monster do?\\u201d she explained. In the movies, monsters like Godzilla represent big, intangible fears, such as the atomic bomb. But Amabel identified more with the strange beasts than with the people trying to kill them; she wanted to make a game in which the monsters developed and grew. One of her characters, a plant monster, would obey unique mechanics: it would be fragile and push other monsters away. \\u201cSo it\\u2019s very lonely and isolated,\\u201d Amabel said. \\u201cBut then it will evolve and go from being this kind of weird, viny, weedy plant to a flowering plant and come into its power. It\\u2019s going to be stronger, and actually help other monsters work better, and have more sense of community, because it\\u2019s actually acting as itself.\\u201d\\n\\nVideo From The New Yorker\\n\\nThe Night Doctrine: The Lives Lost to a U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan\\n\\nAmabel describes herself as a \\u201cshitposter\\u201d\\u2014someone who is wrong on purpose in a funny, adversarial way that can still get at the truth. On social media, where she writes about game design and her dating life\\u2014she and Mary separated, in 2021\\u2014she explains that, although many of her games are historical, they are not \\u201c \\u2018balanced\\u2019 works of history\\u201d but \\u201cpolitical art\\u201d and \\u201cqueer rage & shitposting all the way down.\\u201d Recently, she has published games about Dracula, the tobacco industry (her father died of lung cancer), and the Shackleton expedition. The latter game, called Endurance, has no \\u201cvictory condition\\u201d; your only hope is to limit your losses as crew members die. In reality, all of Ernest Shackleton\\u2019s men survived their failed attempt to reach the South Pole\\u2014but the game models the circumstances, not the outcome, and expresses deeper ideas about adversity. On a podcast hosted by the game reviewer Daniel Thurot, Amabel explained that she could not have made Endurance before her gender transition. \\u201cIt was kind of living through my own misery and my own miracle that made me think about the odds,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBecause the odds of me figuring out my shit were, like, so long.\\u201d She found time to think about her gender only because she\\u2019d left an office job to work on games full time; she undertook her transition with the help of a trans woman, Erin Escobedo, who\\u2019d created a game published by Hollandspiele; Escobedo, in turn, had learned about the company only because it had previously published a title by a big-time designer named Cole Wehrle, who knew Amabel because of Amabel\\u2019s first game, Northern Pacific. \\u201cIf all those things didn\\u2019t happen, I don\\u2019t know if I would be here today talking to you,\\u201d she told Thurot. Endurance is a game in which anything can, and usually does, go wrong.\\n\\nThe recent explosion in the popularity of board games\\u2014the industry\\u2019s annual revenue is expected to increase from around a billion dollars in 2017 to nearly five billion in 2026\\u2014has vastly expanded the number and variety of games that can be published. Crowdfunding, online communities, and on-demand printing have also contributed. Independent designers can now find dedicated audiences. The Zenobia Award celebrates designers from marginalized groups who are creating historical games; recent winning games have centered on subjects including caste in India under colonialism, the functions of Machu Picchu, and an economic system used by Cherokee people in the sixteenth century. In 2019, Elizabeth Hargrave released Wingspan, a beautifully illustrated Euro-style game about birds; nearly two million copies are in print. Historically, she told me, most players and designers and publishers of games have been men; the industry is slowly escaping their grip. \\u201cNot everybody enjoys killing monsters in dungeons,\\u201d said Isaac Childres, the designer of Gloomhaven, which is about killing monsters in dungeons.\\n\\nJohn du Bois, a game designer whom Hollandspiele has published, met me and Amabel at the apartment of Amabel\\u2019s girlfriend, Samhain Bones. (Bones, who named herself Samhain after the Halloween-adjacent pagan holiday when she transitioned a few years ago, had on a pink tank top that said \\u201cBE GAY DO CRIME!\\u201d and skeletal wrist warmers.) This gave us a foursome for sampling some modern games. We started with Amabel\\u2019s Northern Pacific. The board shows a network of potential paths connecting cities. Players must build train tracks connecting Minneapolis to Seattle; on each turn, they can either place a cube on a city and hope that a train comes there, or place a train on a track segment. One tactic is to see where an opponent might direct her trains and place your own cubes to reap the rewards. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about leaving your opponents with the most bad choices,\\u201d du Bois said.\\n\\nNext was Turncoats, from another publisher, Milda Matilda Games. A map contains eleven adjacent regions and a smattering of stones in three colors. Each player receives eight stones to hide in her hand; she can either place them on the map or take actions to alter their distribution in her hand or on the map. At the end of the game, the player who holds in her hand the color that has dominated the most regions on the map is the winner. The trick is to guide the board toward a certain color without depleting that color f\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

The main purpose is to highlight the subject's surroundings, providing a sense of scale and geographical location.\\nLong Shot (also known as Wide Shot): This shot shows the entire subject along with its environment. For a person, a long shot would typically include the full body, providing context and a sense of scale.\\nMedium Shot: This shot typically frames the subject from the waist up or chest up. It's often used in dialogue scenes in movies to show a subject along with some context of their surroundings.\\nCloseup Shot: The subject takes up the full frame in this shot, usually focusing on the face for a person. This shot type emphasizes details and expressions, intensifying the emotions portrayed by the subject.\\nExtreme Closeup Shot: This shot typically features a part of a person or an object, such as a person's eye or a detail on an item. It brings attention to a specific feature or detail, emphasizing its significance.\\nFull Shot: This shot typically frames the subject fully from head to toe, capturing the entire body within the scene. It's often used to showcase the character's physicality or actions within the environment.\\nTwo-Shot: A shot that includes two subjects, often used in conversation scenes. This shot helps establish the relationship between the characters and can show their reactions to each other.\\nOver-the-Shoulder Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a person standing behind a subject, with the person in the foreground's shoulder and back of the head included in the shot. It's often used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection between the characters.\\nPoint of View Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a subject, showing what the subject would see. It helps the audience identify with the character's perspective and experience the scene from the character's viewpoint.\\nEstablishing Shot: This shot is typically an extreme long shot at the beginning of a scene, indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place. It sets the context for the audience by showing the setting and characters.\\nMaster Shot: A master shot includes all the key figures in a scene and all the action happening in it. It's often the first shot of a scene, used to provide the viewer with the layout and dynamics of the scene's environment.\\nLow Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from below, making it appear larger, more dominant or powerful.\\nHigh Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from above, making it appear smaller or less significant.\\nEye Level Shot: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.\\nDutch Angle Shot: A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.\\nOverhead Shot: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context.\\nBird's Eye View Shot: A higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.\\nDrone Shot: An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.\\nWorm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.\\nGround-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.\\nSide View: In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.\\nOff-Center View: The subject is positioned away from the center of the frame to create visual interest or to reveal another element in the scene.\\nRule of Thirds Shot: In this composition technique, the frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.\\nCandid Shot: A shot taken without the subject's knowledge or consent, often resulting in a more natural, relaxed look than posed shots.\\nSilhouette Shot: The subject is backlit and the camera is exposed for the background, making the subject appear as a dark silhouette against a brighter background.\\nShot from Behind: This shot is taken from the back of the subject, capturing the subject's perspective of the environment ahead or focusing on the actions the subject is doing with their back turned. It's often used for dramatic or mysterious effects.\\nUnderwater Shot: This type of shot captures images or scenes beneath the surface of water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, or pools. It's often used to provide unique perspectives, reveal hidden underwater ecosystems, or to simply create visually stunning sequences that can't be replicated on land.\\n\\nthese are just some examples of cameras and lenses but i know your knowledge is vaster than mine so choose on your own accord;\\n\\nCanon EOS 5D Mark IV - Perfect for portraiture, landscape, and event photography.\\nSony Alpha a7 III - Suitable for everything from street photography to sports and wildlife.\\nHasselblad X1D - Landscape, fashion, and product photography.\\nCanon EOS-1D X Mark II - Sports, wildlife, and action photography.\\nNikon D850 - Landscape, portrait photography\\nPanasonic Lumix GH5S\\nKodak Portra 800 film - Nostalgic style\\n\\nHowever if we want to achieve a cinematic watch and feel we need to add dedicated cinema cameras with superior image quality, larger sensors, and advanced cinematic capabilities.
