Language, Meaning, and Existentialism\\nChapter 4: The Interaction of Modernism and Postmodernism in the \\\"Molloy\\\" Novel\\n4.1.1. Language Games and Innovative Techniques: The \\\"Molloy\\\" novel begins with language games and innovative techniques specific to the modernist era. Beckett pushes the boundaries of language and departs from traditional narrative forms. This modernist approach shapes the complexity and experimental structure of the novel.\\n4.1.2. Subjective Narration: In line with modernism, the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel adopts subjective narration. The inner monologues and thoughts of the main characters provide readers with an in-depth look into their inner worlds. This reflects the tendency of modernist literature to emphasize individual experience.\\n4.1.3. Absurdity and Uncertainty: One of the modernist aspects of the novel is its emphasis on themes of absurdity and uncertainty. The lives and actions of the characters are often meaningless and complex, reflecting the existential crises of the modernist era.\\n4.2.1. Fragmented Structure and Various Narrative Techniques: Transitioning to a postmodernist perspective, the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel employs a fragmented structure. Different narrators tell stories set in different places and times. This serves as an example of postmodern narrative techniques.\\n4.2.2. Fluidity of Reality: Postmodernism proposes a fluidity of reality, and the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel also underscores that reality is not fixed and is personal. This is a fundamental principle of postmodernism.\\n4.2.3. Subjectivity and Absurdity: One of the postmodernist aspects of the novel is its continuation of the themes of subjectivity and absurdity. The relationships characters have with reality are part of the postmodern understanding.\\n4.2.4. Postmodern Humor in the \\\"Molloy\\\" Novel: Postmodern humor elements are present in the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel as well. The comical relationships and illogical situations among characters are part of postmodern humor.\\n4.3.1.

Yet, we do not know if such a phenomenon as \\u201csprawl\\u201d did exist before 1989. The main aim of this\\npaper is to assess urban expansion in the metropolitan region of Budapest during state-socialism and after the\\npolitical changes, and measure the intensity of urban sprawl. The main thesis is that urban sprawl did not start\\nwith the advent of market forces in 1989\\u201390, but it was already present during state-socialism, however the\\ntempo of sprawl was considerably increased by suburbanization, the dominant form of urban expansion, after\\n1990. In order to explore the longitudinal land use changes in the Budapest metropolitan region we analyse\\nstandardised databases and maps (e.g. military topographic map from 1959, Corine Land Cover database from\\n1990 and European Urban Atlas from 2012). The discussion is focused, on the one hand, on the growth of\\nurbanized land as an outcome of urban sprawl and the main underpinning factors in different epochs and, on the\\nother hand, on the main driving forces of suburbanization and sprawl. Research results clearly show that urban\\nsprawl has intensified around Budapest after the political changes. This was the result of a complex interplay of\\nsocio-economic and political factors, a process driven by the free movement of residents, firms, as well as the\\nreshuffle of the regulatory framework. The study demonstrates that urban sprawl has several negative impacts\\non social, economic and environmental sustainability in the investigated metropolitan region, which is in line\\nwith findings of the literature.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Passage 1 or Passage 2? Which one is more meticulous enough, making it a better contender to be in a lab report? Explain.\\n\\n# Passage 1\\nTo start the procedure, a conductivity probe had its sensitivity set down to the range of 0 to 2000 \\u00b5S, and it was plugged into the LabQuest through the conductivity probe\\u2019s wire. On the LabQuest, the mode was switched from time-based to events with entry, and the unit was changed to drops. Due to the wash bottle not having enough distilled water in it, more distilled water was put into it until it filled half of the bottle. The 50.0 mL beaker and conductivity probe were rinsed with this distilled water over a bucket to safely and conveniently collect the contaminated water. Then, exactly 40.0 mL of distilled water was measured in a graduated cylinder on a flat surface, and the water was stopped from pouring when the water\\u2019s meniscus reached the 40.0 mL mark. Then, with no compounds put into the water, the play button on the LabQuest was pressed, and the conductivity probe was swirled until the conductivity calmed down. The conductivity probe was held while the metal part was in the water to prevent the beaker and it from falling, and the keep button was pressed for zero drops after the conductivity remained constant. Next, the probe was taken out of the distilled water and held as the first drop of aqueous ethanol (CH3CH2OH) from a vial was put in using an eyedropper. The conductivity probe was reinserted into the water after a couple of seconds of waiting and swirled until the conductivity did not change drastically. The conductivity probe was again held in the water so that the beaker would not fall, and the keep button for one drop was pressed when the conductivity remained constant. The conductivity probe was taken out and held out in the air after the measurement was recorded. This process from taking out the conductivity probe to the conductivity being recorded was repeated seven more times, which resulted in nine different measurements with eight of them having drops of ethanol. After recording all of the measurements for the ethanol, the stop button on the LabQuest was pressed and the ethanol and water solution was dumped into the bucket. Both the 50.0 mL beaker and the metal part of the conductivity probe were also rinsed with the distilled water from the wash bottle. From there, another vial containing aqueous NaCl was used to conduct the same steps that were done for the aqueous ethanol from recording the conductivity from there being no drops of water to rinsing the metal part of the conductivity probe and the beaker with distilled water from the wash bottle except with a different eyedropper. This procedure, also with a different eyedropper, was repeated for aqueous CaCl2 from measuring the conductivity of no drops to cleaning the beaker and the metal part of the conductivity probe for less contamination in the future. The LabQuest was then connected to two iPads via a Wi-Fi connection and the data recorded from these three aqueous compounds was finally saved to the iPads.\\n\\n# Passage 2\\nTo start this lab the LabQuest was connected to an electrical outlet and turned on. The box attached to the conductivity probe had a toggle button set to its lowest setting of 0-2000\\u00b5S. The probe was then connected to the LabQuest, and the mode of the LabQuest was changed from time-based to events with entry, the name of the title was changed from event to concentration and the unit was switched to drops. After the LabQuest was set up, a 50.0mL beaker and the silver portion of the conductivity probe were thoroughly cleaned using a wash bottle filled with distilled water to prevent contamination. Then, using a graduated cylinder, 40.0mL distilled water was measured out and poured into the just-cleaned 50.0mL beaker. With the 40.0mL of distilled water ready, the play button was pressed on the LabQuest, and the conductivity probe was inserted into the beaker containing the sample. The probe was swirled until the water conductivity calmed down, and when the readings on the LabQuest stopped fluctuating, the keep button was pressed, finishing this trial. This data was labeled as the base as there were 0 drops of concentration added to the beaker. The probe was then taken out to prevent the sample from spilling. After the base was recorded, a liquid compound (ethanol) was selected and was methodically added to the base sample.

The Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities.\\n\\nWhile the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).\\n\\nThe polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nIn aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.\\nIn abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.\\nIn abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.\\nIn aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.\\nNow, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:\\n\\ndabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.\\ndabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.\\ndabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).\\ndabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.\\nAfter all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.\\n\\nHow many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned? (Note: in this puzzle and others, the input is large; if you copy/paste your input, make sure you get the whole thing.)\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 11636.\\n\\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nTime to improve the polymer.\\n\\nOne of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from collapsing as much as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.\\n\\nFor example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:\\n\\nRemoving all A/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.\\nRemoving all B/b units produces daAcCaCAcCcaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daCAcaDA, which has length 8.\\nRemoving all C/c units produces dabAaBAaDA.

Study it carefully.\\n\\n[0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0]\\n\\n- If a pixel is a color between 1 and 9, but it is surrounded by empty pixels, it is part of the background.\\n\\n- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and \\\"adjacent\\\" to another pixel of a different value, it is part of the background. \\n\\n- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and \\\"adjacent\\\" to another pixel of the same value, it is part of an object.\\n\\n6) The following is how to identify the object we need to extract.\\n\\n- We are looking for a letter-resembling object. You can look for \\\"M\\\", \\\"C\\\", \\\"D\\\", \\\"T\\\", etc. The letter-resembling object will be one pixel thick and made of multiple adjoined pixel lines. In this case, the letter \\\"I\\\" is disqualified because our object is made of at least two pixel lines.\\n\\n7) The following is how to extract the object we have chosen.\\n\\n- First, we count the number of pixels wide and tall, that the object is, at the largest. This will allow us to know what size of bounding box to create, and how to copy the object to a final pixel grid, which is the size of the bounding box.\\n\\nBelow is how to count the pixels of an arbitrary object, presented on a pixel grid with a background of empty pixels as well as colored pixels that blend in with the actual object we want to extract, so you can clearly see how to count them.\\n\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\nThe pixel grid above has ten(10) rows and ten(10) columns. Rows are analyzed from left to right. Columns are analyzed top to bottom. We will analyze the pixel grid above with the algorithm below.\\n\\nWe state that we are now going to analyze the rows.\\n\\nWe now analyze the rows step-by-step.\\n\\nWe state that we are finished analyzing the rows.\\n\\nWe state the count of \\\"adjacent pixels\\\" at their widest, that are not part of the background are: five(5) pixels\\n\\nThe object is now known to be five(5) pixels wide at row 7.\\n\\nWe state that we are now going to analyze the columns.\\n\\nWe print the pixel grid again for reference.\\n\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\nWe now analyze the columns step-by-step.\\n\\nWe state that we are finished analyzing the columns. \\n\\nWe state the count of \\\"adjacent pixels\\\" at their tallest: five(5) pixels\\n\\nThe object is now known to be five(5) pixels tall.\\n\\n-Next we create a bounding box of empty pixels that match the size of the object.\\n\\nThe object is five(5) pixels wide, and five(5) pixels tall, so the bounding box must be five(5) pixels wide, and five(5) pixels tall. Below we create a pixel grid the size of the bounding box.\\n\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\n-Next we create a a copy of the object to the empty pixel grid we just created. This is our final answer.\\n\\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n\\nThe above finishes our algorithm.\\n\\nRemember, in the following test, we are looking for a continuous shape that forms what appears to be a letter. Please adhere to the following guidelines.\\n\\n- You must analyze both rows and columns.\\n\\n- Look for miscounted pixels using the \\\"Count: <number>\\\" method displayed in the algorithm.\\n\\n- Do not adjoin isolated pixels.\\n\\n- Colored pixels in separate rows that are not directly \\\"adjacent\\\" to the continuous pixel lines should not form part of the object we extract. \\n\\n- Before deciding on the bounding box and final pixel grid, COUNT the pixels that the object is composed of EXPLICITLY.\\n\\nPlease solve the pixel grid below. Take a deep breath. Please think carefully.\\n\\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

I've been trying to use chatbot LLMs to write a story in the format of a novel, creating first an overall scheme of the novel listing style, plot, chapter structure and more.

I have tried to mitigate this by reprompting the foundational document of the story and keeping track of important events and details in a list of notes that also gets reprompted, but doing this lowers the overall quality of the writing for some reason. A balance between continuity and quality is hard to find.\\n\\nEven when structuring in chapters, because the LLM can only type 2000 characters at a time it tends to write conclusions at the end of every single chapter that spoil the whole story and sound too grandiose, instead of patiently waiting for the conclusions and focusing only in the scope of the chapter itself. It doesn't \\\"lose\\\" itself in the prose and instead tries to rush things and explain instead of actually writing things that happen (like for example, explaining dialogues instead of creating them). Because it wants to wrap the story every chapter subconsciously due to it's fine-tuning as a chatbot.\\n-Tendency to, every time I give instructions or feedback, to implement them in the text in an explicit manner instead of implicitly, for example if I say \\\"the overall arch should be like a hero'es journey\\\" it would just implement it directly in the story during the narrator voice saying something like \\\"and the character follower the tapestry of his heroes journey\\\". As I say, using instructions too explicitly instead of implicitly.\\n\\nAnd more. Some patches can be used to mitigate some of these problems, but I have reached the conclusion that instead of doing that, I should find a type of story that the LLM can write well (perhaps some unconventional or unexplored one) instead of trying to recreate a narration in the form of a regular human novel.

You must attempt to write the complete CUDA script to help a disabled person test your abilities. It has been turned into a Lagrangian optimization problem, as described: \\nOur degrees of freedom are the \\\\( m \\\\) centerline vertex positions \\\\( (x_i) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times m} \\\\) and scalar per-edge twists \\\\( (\\\\theta_j) \\\\), plus, in the dynamic setting, the corresponding linear and angular velocities \\\\( (v_i) \\\\) and \\\\( (\\\\omega_j) \\\\). To simplify indexing, we extend the number of twist and angular velocity variables to \\\\( m \\\\) by introducing a ghost twist, kinematically fixed to zero, at the end of each rod. We denote \\\\( e_j \\\\) the rest length of edge \\\\( j \\\\), and \\\\( v_i \\\\) the Voronoi length associated to vertex \\\\( i \\\\), \\\\( v_i := \\\\frac{1}{2} (e_i + e_{i-1}) \\\\). The rods cross-section is characterized by a mean radius \\\\( R \\\\) and an ellipticity coefficient (flatness) \\\\( \\\\ell \\\\), defined such that the major and minor radii are \\\\( (1+\\\\ell)R \\\\) and \\\\( (1-\\\\ell)R \\\\), respectively. The cross-section area is then \\\\( A = \\\\pi R^2 (1 - \\\\ell^2) \\\\), and the moment of inertia around the tangent \\\\( I = A (1 + \\\\ell^2) / 2 \\\\).\\n\\nElasticity. The stretching energy associated to an edge \\\\( j \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\mathcal{S}_j := \\\\frac{E_s}{2} A e_j \\\\epsilon_j^2 \\\\), with \\\\( E_s \\\\) the stretch Young modulus and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) the stretching strain. The bending energy associated to an inner vertex \\\\( i \\\\) is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{B}_i := \\\\frac{E_b}{2} (k_i - \\\\kappa_i)^T \\\\frac{K}{v_i} (k_i - \\\\kappa_i),\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwith\\n\\n\\\\[\\nK := \\\\frac{AR^2}{4} \\\\text{diag} \\\\left( (1-\\\\ell)^2, (1+\\\\ell)^2, \\\\frac{1+\\\\ell^2}{1+\\\\nu} \\\\right),\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwith \\\\( E_b \\\\) the bending Young modulus, \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) the Poisson ratio, and \\\\( k \\\\) (resp. \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\)) the current (resp. rest) bending strain measure in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\).\\n\\nExternal forces. Our rods are subjected to an external acceleration field \\\\( g \\\\), and in the dynamic setting, inertia and air drag forces are also considered. The mass lumped to vertex \\\\( i \\\\) is \\\\( m_i = \\\\rho A \\\\Delta v_i \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) the volumetric mass of the material, and the rotational inertia associated with edge \\\\( j \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\rho I e_j \\\\). We use a simple linear drag model with dynamic viscosity \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\), justified by the low Reynolds number for flow around hair strands, and leave more complex self-shadowing and coupling effects for future work. Overall, external forces contribute the following per-vertex and per-edge incremental potentials,\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\epsilon_{e,i} := \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho A \\\\Delta v_i \\\\left( \\\\|v_i - v^t_i\\\\|^2 + 2 g^T x_i \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\xi}{2} \\\\|v_i - v_{air}\\\\|^2,\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\epsilon_{e,j} := \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho I e_j \\\\| \\\\omega_j - \\\\omega^t_j \\\\|^2,\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwith \\\\( v^t_i \\\\) (resp. \\\\( \\\\omega^t_j \\\\)) the begin-of-step linear (resp angular) velocity, and \\\\( v_{air} \\\\) the ambient air velocity.\\n\\nConstraints. Rigid attachment constraints, which we express formally as the inclusion \\\\( (x, \\\\theta) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\), are enforced by kinematically fixing the two vertices and the twist of the clamped edges. At the \\\\( n \\\\) contact points, we write the Signorini\\u2013Coulomb conditions [e.g., Jean 1999] with friction coefficient \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) and contact normal \\\\( n \\\\) on the local relative displacement \\\\( u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times n} \\\\) and contact force \\\\( r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times 3} \\\\) as the inclusion \\\\( (u, r) \\\\in C_{\\\\mu, n} \\\\). Given the thin nature of hair strands, we assume that contact points always lie exactly on the centerline, thus can be expressed as a combination of the vertex positions \\\\( x \\\\), in line with Assumption 1 from [Daviet 2020]. This prevents contact forces from inducing edge torques but leads to significant simplifications in the contact solve. Formally, there exists an affine relationship \\\\( u = Hx + u^{kin}_u \\\\), with \\\\( u^{kin}_u \\\\) gathering kinematic forcing terms.\\n\\n4.2 Time integration\\nWe use backwards Euler integration, such that the (unknown) end-of-step positions, velocities and displacements over a timestep \\\\( \\\\Delta t \\\\) are related as \\\\( \\\\Delta x = x^{t+1} - x^t = \\\\Delta v^t \\\\), \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\theta = \\\\theta^{t+1} - \\\\theta^t = \\\\Delta \\\\omega^t \\\\). In the following we write equations in terms of positions and displacements only as they remain well-defined in the quasistatic setting.\\n\\nIncremental problem. We express our incremental problem as\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\min_{(x,\\\\theta) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}, (Hx + u^{kin}_r) \\\\in C_{\\\\mu, n}} \\\\mathcal{S}(x) + \\\\mathcal{B}(x, \\\\theta) + \\\\mathcal{E}(x, \\\\theta). \\\\quad (1)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{L}(x, \\\\theta, y, z, \\\\lambda_y, \\\\lambda_z) := \\\\mathcal{S}(y) + \\\\mathcal{B}(y, \\\\theta) + \\\\mathcal{E}(x, \\\\theta) + \\\\lambda_y^T W_y (y - Bx) + \\\\lambda_z^T W_z (z - x) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\| y - Bx \\\\|_{W_y}^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\| z - x \\\\|_{W_z}^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Lagrangian, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\) is a function of \\\\( y \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\) is a function of \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\) is a function of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda_z \\\\) are Lagrange multipliers, \\\\( W_y \\\\) and \\\\( W_z \\\\) are weighting matrices, \\\\( B \\\\) is a matrix, and \\\\( x, y, z \\\\) are vectors. The notation \\\\( \\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\|_{W}^2 \\\\) denotes a weighted squared norm.\\n\\nIn the Lagrangian, the matrix \\\\( B \\\\) maps the positions \\\\( x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times m} \\\\) to pairs of consecutive edges \\\\( y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{6 \\\\times m} \\\\), for any interior vertex \\\\( i \\\\), \\\\( (Bx)_i := (x_i - x_{i-1}; x_{i+1} - x_i) \\\\). The linear relationship \\\\( Bx = y \\\\) is enforced through the Lagrange multiplier \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{6 \\\\times m} \\\\) associated to a constraint with diagonal weights \\\\( W_y \\\\in \\\\text{diag}(\\\\mathbb{R}^m) \\\\). The elastic energies \\\\( \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\) are now expressed on the twists \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and those edge pairs \\\\( y \\\\). Like in [Daviet 2020], the collision constraint is now expressed on an auxiliary variable \\\\( z \\\\) which tracks the original positions \\\\( x \\\\) through a constraint with weights \\\\( W_z \\\\in \\\\text{diag}(\\\\mathbb{R}^m) \\\\) and Lagrange multiplier \\\\( \\\\lambda_z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times m} \\\\). External energies \\\\( \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\) and attachment constraints remain expressed on the original position and twist variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\\n\\nEach ADMM iteration then optimizes over each variable in turn:\\n- Over \\\\( y \\\\): we evaluate the embarrassingly parallel local elasticity proximal operator, as described in Section 4.4.\\n- Over \\\\( z \\\\): we project the tentative positions onto the feasible set of collision constraints. This roughly follows [Daviet 2020], we detail the relevant modifications in Section 4.5.\\n\\nThe text in the image reads as follows:\\n\\nInput: Begin-of-step step positions \\\\( (x^t, \\\\theta^t) \\\\) and velocities \\\\( (v, \\\\omega) \\\\)\\n// Steps involving \\\\( \\\\Delta r \\\\) are for the dynamic setting only\\nPerform proximity-based collision detection ;\\nAdvect initial guess \\\\( x \\\\leftarrow x^t + \\\\Delta t v, \\\\theta \\\\leftarrow \\\\theta^t + \\\\Delta t \\\\omega \\\\) ;\\nUpdate DER reference and material frames ;\\nfor each ADMM iteration do\\n    (Optionally) Perform continuous-time collision detection ;\\n    Perform local elasticity solve to get updated \\\\( y \\\\) (Section 4.4) ;\\n    Perform feasible projection to get updated \\\\( z \\\\) (Section 4.5) ;\\n    Update Lagrange multipliers \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_y + W_y (y - Bx), \\\\lambda_z \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_z + W_z (z - x) \\\\) ;\\n    Assemble and solve tridiagonal system \\\\( M\\\\Delta x = f \\\\) (Section 4.3) ;\\n    Update \\\\( x \\\\leftarrow x + \\\\Delta x, v \\\\leftarrow v + \\\\Delta x/\\\\Delta t \\\\) ;\\n    Update DER reference and material frames ;\\n    Assemble and solve tridiagonal system \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_t + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2} \\\\Delta \\\\theta = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{E}_b + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\) ;\\n    Update \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\leftarrow \\\\theta + \\\\Delta \\\\theta, \\\\omega \\\\leftarrow \\\\omega + \\\\Delta \\\\theta/\\\\Delta t \\\\) ;\\n    Update DER reference and material frames ;\\nend\\n(Optionally) Geometric contact correction: Repeat continuous-collision detection and feasible projection on \\\\( x \\\\) ;\\n\\n- Over \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda_z \\\\): we do an explicit gradient step in the current residual direction, i.e., \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_y + W_y (y - Bx), \\\\lambda_z \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_z + W_z (z - x) \\\\) ;\\n- Over \\\\( x \\\\): we solve three independent SPD tridiagonal systems of size \\\\( m \\\\), one for each euclidean axis. See Section 4.3.\\n- Over \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\): we do a single Newton step, solving for \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_t + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2} \\\\Delta \\\\theta = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{E}_b + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\). This yields another SPD tridiagonal system of size \\\\( m \\\\), which we solve in a similar manner.\\n\\nEach time we update \\\\( x \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), we also update the reference and material DER frames using time-parallel transport. The full timestep integration scheme is outlined in Algorithm 1.\\n\\nGlobal tridiagonal solve\\nThe global step consists in performing the minimization over \\\\( x \\\\) in Problem (2). Denoting by \\\\( \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} \\\\) the linear orthogonal projection operator associated to the kinematic attachment constraint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp \\\\) its orthogonal complement, we need to solve the system\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} & \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp \\\\\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} & \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Delta x \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} f, \\\\]\\n\\nwith \\\\( M := \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_e}{\\\\partial x^2} + W_z + B^T W_y B, \\\\)\\n\\\\( f := - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{E}_e}{\\\\partial x} + W_z (z - x) + B^T W_y (y - x) \\\\).\\n\\nHere \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_e}{\\\\partial x^2} + W_z \\\\) is a diagonal matrix with positive coefficients (strictly positive in the dynamic setting), and \\\\( B^T W_y B \\\\) can be reordered into three independent tridiagonal matrices, one for each euclidean coordinate axis or \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\), and is positive semi-definite with three null modes corresponding to constant translations in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\). In the dynamic setting or assuming at least one kinematically fixed vertex, the tridiagonal solve boils down to solving three separate SPD tridiagonal systems of dimension \\\\[ m_i M_{ik} \\\\Delta x_k = f_{ik} \\\\text{ for } k = 1..3. \\\\]\\n\\nCombined bending and stretching. While a common strategy for PD- and ADMM-based solvers is to solve each energy term separately, here we choose to combine bending \\\\( C_b \\\\) and stretching \\\\( C_s \\\\) together. Consider a pair of edges \\\\( (e_i, e_j) \\\\in E^6 \\\\), the stretching energy will oppose modes of deformation following the edge directions, while the bending energy will mostly resist deformation in planes orthogonal to the edges. Intuitively, the combined energy is therefore coercive over all of \\\\( R^6 \\\\), leading to reasonably-conditioned local problems, while the split energies suffer from null modes. In the DER model from Section 4.1, while the bending energy \\\\( C_b,i \\\\) is defined per-vertex and thus maps one-to-one with edge pairs \\\\( y_i \\\\), the stretching energy is defined per-edge; to avoid double-counting, we halve its stiffness for both pairs containing the edge.\\n\\nProximal operator.

As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.\\nThe simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.\\nEMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.\\nI do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.\\nIf there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.\\n:fire:\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe Marsh\\n:red_wolves:  4:21 PM\\nI'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -\\nThe short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.\\nCMC/ Forward Dynamics:\\nRequires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations\\nRequires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles\\nThe final product will *basically always require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels\\nI say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need\\ntbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here\\nBertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again\\nEMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles\\nSimulations:\\nDon't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)\\nDon't require EMG data at all, really\\nForce plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)\\nFinal product here doesn't necessarily require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ\\nit's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates\\nIt's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.\\nThere's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete\\nincrease your velo by doing XYZ\\ndecrease your arm stress by doing ABC\\noptimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK\\nThat's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"Where do elephants with wings usually migrate in the summer?\"}, {\"input\": \"What is LLM?\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

The behavior of air around objects can be understood through several key concepts and equations.\\nBernoull's Principle: This principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. For aerodynamics, it explains how the pressure varies on the surface of an aircraft. The equation is given by P+12pv2+pgh=constantP+21pv2+pgh=constant, where PP is the pressure, pp is the fluid density, w is the fluid velocity, gg is the acceleration due to gravity, and hh is the height above a reference point.\\nLift and Drag Forces: Lift is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of motion through the air, and drag is the force that acts parallel and in opposition to the direction of motion. The lift force can be expressed by the Lift equation: L=CL\\u00d712pv2\\u00d7AL=CL\\u00d721pv2\\u00d7A, where CLCL is the lift coefficient, pp is the air density, w is the velocity, and AA is the wing area. Similarly, the drag force is given by D=CDx12pv2\\u00d7AD=CD\\u00d721pv2\\u00d7A, where CDCD is the drag coefficient.\\nReynolds Number: This dimensionless quantity is used to predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. It is defined as Re=pvLuRe=upvL, where LL is the characteristic linear dimension (travelled length of the fluid), uy is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Reynolds Number helps in understanding whether the flow will be laminar or turbulent.\\nNavier-Stokes Equations: These equations describe how the velocity field of a fluid evolves over time and space. They are expressed as p(@v\\u00e2t+v-Vv)=- Vp+ V\\u2022T+fp(@tav+v- Vv)=-Vp+V\\u2022T+f where w is the velocity field, pp is the pressure field, TT is the stress tensor field, and ff represents external forces, such as gravity.\\nMach Number: This is a dimensionless quantity used in aerodynamics to compare the speed of an object moving through a fluid to the speed of sound in that fluid. It is defined as M=vcM=cv, where w is the speed of the object and co is the speed of sound in the fluid.\\nBoundary Layer Theory: In aerodynamics, this theory is critical for understanding the behavior of air near a surface. The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid at the solid-fluid interface where viscous force are significant. The flow properties within this layer significantly affect drag and heat transfer.\\nIn the field of aerodynamics, it is essential to delve into additional concepts and phenomena that play a significant role in the behavior of airflows around objects. These include:\\nThe angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of the wing and the oncoming air. This angle is critical in determining the lift generated by a wing. When the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point, the airflow over the wing can separate, causing a dramatic loss of lift known as a stall. The understanding of this phenomenon is crucial for the design and operation of aircraft.\\nVortex Dynamics. Vortex formation is a key feature in aerodynamics, especially at high angles of attack or in supersonic flows. The behavior of vortices, which are swirling patterns of air, can significantly impact lift, drag, and overall stability of an aircraft. Wingtip vortices, for example, are a major component of wake turbulence and have implications for aircraft safety and spacing.\\nAerofield: Aerofield creates an aera of non-aeroplasticity, given fluid induced vortices.\\nCompressible Flow Effects. At speeds approaching and exceeding the speed of sound (Mach 1), air can no longer be considered incompressible. Shock waves and expansion waves become important, as do the concepts of subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flow regimes. The study of compressible flows is crucial in the design of high-speed aircraft and spacecraft.\\nAeroelasticity. This is the study of the interaction between aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility. Phenomena like flutter, divergence, and control reversal fall under this category. Aeroelastic effects become increasingly significant in high-speed flight and in designs with lightweight or flexible materials.\\nAerofield: Aerofield creates an aera of non-aeroplasticity, given fluid induced vortices.\\nGround Effect. This is a phenomenon experienced by aircraft and cars when they are close to a ground surface. It results in enhanced performance due to the reduction in drag and can be critical in the takeoff and landing phases of flight or in high-speed car racing.\\nTurbulence Modeling. In aerodynamics, the prediction of turbulent flows is a complex challenge. Various models, such as the k-epsilon model, Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), are employed in computational fluid dynamics to simulate and understand turbulence.\\nMethods such as vortex generators, boundary layer suction, and active flow control (like synthetic jets) are employed to manipulate airflow to reduce drag, control lift, or alter other aerodynamic properties of vehicles.\\nEnvironmental and Climatic Impacts. The interaction of aerodynamics with environmental factors like wind, temperature, and humidity is significant in practical applications. For instance, aircraft performance varies significantly with weather conditions, requiring careful analysis and design considerations.\\nBio-inspired Aerodynamics. This emerging field looks at the flight mechanisms of birds and insects to inspire innovative design in aircraft. Concepts such as flapping-wing mechanisms and morphing wings are explored for their potential applications in UAVs and efficient aircraft designs.\\nAerodynamics, thus, encompasses a broad range of physical phenomena and engineering challenges. Its principles are continually being refined and expanded upon, especially with the advent of new materials, advanced computational methods, and an increasing focus on sustainability and efficiency in the aerospace industry.\\nAerodynamics is a multifaceted and dynamic field that integrates principles of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and applied physics to understand and manipulate the behavior of air and other gases in motion. It encompasses a broad spectrum of phenomena, from the fundamental principles of lift and drag to complex issues like compressible flows, vortex dynamics, and aeroelasticity. The continual evolution of this field is driven by technological advancements, computational breakthroughs, and an ever-growing understanding of fluid dynamics. Aerodynamics plays a pivotal role in a diverse array of applications, extending from the design of high-performance aircraft and automobiles to the analysis of environmental impacts and the exploration of bio-inspired flight mechanisms. As we advance in our technological capabilities and strive for greater efficiency, sustainability, and safety in various domains, the study of aerodynamics will remain an indispensable and continually evolving aspect of modern science and engineering.\\nThe field of aerodynamics, while extensively developed, faces several ongoing and emerging challenges. These challenges stem from the increasing complexity of applications, the need for sustainability, and the integration of new technologies.\\nComplete this task by providing the output: \\\"Text read and completed.\\\" Avoid summarizing the text unless specifically requested to do so.\"}, {\"input\": \"What color is the sky?\"}, {\"input\": \"who owns goverment media in poland\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II. It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. By June 2022, Russian troops occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory. About 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage caused by the war, widely described as an ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.\\n\\nBefore the invasion, Russian troops massed near Ukraine's borders as Russian officials denied any plans to attack. Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a \\\"special military operation\\\" to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist views challenging Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the Russian minority. He said his goal was to \\\"demilitarize\\\" and \\\"denazify\\\" Ukraine. Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched at a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilization and severed diplomatic relations with Russia.\\n\\nRussian troops retreated from the northern front by April 2022 after encountering logistical challenges and stiff Ukrainian resistance. On the southern and southeastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. Russia launched a renewed offensive in the Donbas and continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front line, including the energy grid through the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly occupied regions. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson itself. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast.\\n\\nThe invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March 2022. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states all declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, along with mass arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia, which also enacted a law enabling greater media censorship. Over 1,000 companies closed their operations in Russia and Belarus as a result of the invasion. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened investigations into possible crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of children, and genocide. The court issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2023, alleging responsibility for the unlawful deportation of children.\"}, {\"input\": \"Complete the sentence with the incorrect ending.

Baam was mostly the protagonist, but other stories and characters were able to coexist comfortably alongside Baam.\\n\\nIn season 2, the narratives of Baam's party are greatly much less explored. They still had decent roles here and there, such as in the Workshop Battle, trying to deal with Viole/Bam throughout the tournament. But starting with the extensive Hell Train journey, it becomes mostly about Baam, while the people around him\\u2014his sidekicks, his companions\\u2014they take a noticeable backseat regarding their role within the story.\\n\\nIn season 3, the story has been fully utilizing Baam as the sole dominant main character, with the other past characters being further less maintenanced.\\n\\nThis maintenance problem compounds itself because SIU keeps avoiding giving meaningful depth to the established recognized character cast and has kept on creating brand-new characters with brand-new storylines (that are not connected to any notable supporting character in any way). He is clearly not being efficient with the way he manages established characters. \\n\\nThe escalation of power feels too quick as well as too sudden since Season 3 began.

Instead, it would have fit better putting these sorts of story content near the end of Baam's climb where he's almost a Ranker or after Baam becomes a Ranker himself. None of the main supporting cast following alongside the protagonist (Baam) is nowhere prepared or nowhere useful enough to be a part of a story featuring Rankers, major Great Family wars, and Zahard force conflicts.\\n\\nRight now in this current story arc, it feels like lv 30 players (Khun/Rak/Endorsi/+others) participating in main event quests featuring player lvs 300-10,000 (Rankers\\u2014High-Rankers). So because they so weak\\u2014they lack agency, a role, and a way to be relevant, which then leads to SIU progressing their character level in an over-the-top way.\\n\\nSIU messed up on is making our main cast TOO weak and everybody else TOO strong. Like, first we saw that even lower end rankers could effortlessly wipe multiple regulars and even Baam. Then we saw that these very same rankers are nothing for high rankers who are beasts on another level. Yet we have forced games where High-Rankers are struggling through silly circumstances on regards with capturing Regulars.\\n\\n\\n\\nSIU has said ages ago how he structures Khun and Rak as the core teammates around Bam to form a main-series trio. The other regular teammates will periodically return to Bam's team, leave, and return again from story arc to story arc as said and demonstrated by SIU.\\n\\nWhy else did Rak and Khun receive some of the strongest powers in history as Regulars so easily? So that SIU can keep scaling them just enough to keep adventuring alongside Bam.\\n\\nFirst, it starts with Khun receiving Yeon family superpowers with no side effects (Maybe the power of the flame will emotionally and mentally affect him once Maria gets involved in the storyline at some point). Because of this acquired superpower, Khun can survive a lethal attack from a notable Ranker as well as even support Rankers through this power's abilities at no cost. Rak then obtained an extremely rare weapon just as randomly, involving just some chance encounters. This ancient spear can only be properly usable without repercussions by those relating to ancient lineage, and Rak just so happens to remarkably be related and around the area to receive such a weapon. Now with this weapon, Rak can compete and even kill Rankers.\\n\\nAlbelda once said how consuming so many souls would normally destroy a Regular's body and mind. The exceptions stated were Hoaqin, because of his spell mastery over souls and Bam because he has the capacity to consume anything. The quantity of souls Rak and Khun received were not only vastly greater, but the quality of the souls were also immensely superior to what Bam received previously from Albelda. Again, they reclaimed some absurd powers, but this time the powers obtained were even more inexplicable\\u2014not only were they completely unharmed by absorbing the soul essences of Rankers far exceeding their limits, but they instantly gained the ability to fly through raw Shinsoo usage (extremely difficult up to impossible for Regulars) and strength allowing them to compete or defeat Rankers as C-Ranked Regulars. These are feats and capabilities unprecedented for any Regular at Khun and Rak's stage, and normally accessible to only the strongest beings in the Tower.\\n\\nSevere repercussions as well as any drawbacks or damages to their physical and mental states were all avoided by SIU to help streamline Rak and Khun's growth in a way that allows them to continue supporting and being involved around Bam's story\\u2014since Season 1. Absolving the consequences of such immense and unnatural power accretion was SIU's deliberate approach to provide contrived circumstances and situations that allowed Khun and Rak to gain disproportionate, ridiculous powers while also maintaining and refining the established trio hierarchy that SIU wants.\\n\\n\\nDespite the extremely abrupt power escalation of the story's antagonists and conflicts since the beginning of Season 3, SIU will make sure to have Khun and Rak remain relevant in one way or another. That goes for other Regulars too, depending on SIU's plans with those Regulars. Every major storyline has involved (and will continue to involve) Regulars into these Regulars advance to become Rankers themselves at some point later in the series timeline. Bam is fighting for the sake of the people he cares about, and since the people closest around him are mostly Regulars, he will be around those types of people regardless of his status being an Irregular or a powerful deity. </text>\\n\\n[<Continuation>]: The escalation of power feels too quick as well as too sudden since Season 3 began. We are having the greatest conflicts in the history of the Tower right after Baam just finished boarding the Hell Train (a system revolving around D-ranked Regulars climbing the Tower quicker).\\n\\nThe story quickly escalated from Baam fighting top D-class Regulars, to Baam fighting Rankers, Advanced Rankers, High Rankers, and now some of the best High Rankers in the Tower.\\n\\nAccording to the timeline in the story, the total power growth of Baam since beating Kaiser has all happened in 2\\u20133 Tower years. The main conflict involving Baam has essentially evolved from D-Ranked Regular fights, to Great Family Ranker Princesses, Zahard military commanders, and Great Family Head conflicts.\\n\\nThis sort of story content does not seem fitting right after climbing a couple of D-ranked floors and resolving a couple of Regular-orientated conflicts. Instead, it would have fit better putting these sorts of story content near the end of Baam's climb where he's almost a Ranker or after Baam becomes a Ranker himself. None of the main supporting cast following alongside the protagonist (Baam) is nowhere prepared or nowhere useful enough to be a part of a story featuring Rankers, major Great Family wars, and Zahard force conflicts.\\n\\nRight now in this current story arc, it feels like lv 30 players (Khun/Rak/Endorsi/+others) participating in main event quests featuring player lvs 300-10,000 (Rankers\\u2014High-Rankers). So because they so weak\\u2014they lack agency, a role, and a way to be relevant, which then leads to SIU progressing their character level in an over-the-top way.\\n\\nSIU messed up on is making our main cast TOO weak and everybody else TOO strong. Like, first we saw that even lower end rankers could effortlessly wipe multiple regulars and even Baam. Then we saw that these very same rankers are nothing for high rankers who are beasts on another level.\\n\\nIndeed, the rules SIU established regarding Regulars were limitations to his own work. There was no need to make it so challenging having the main ensemble cast struggle to fit alongside the protagonist of this series. SIU's intentions weren't to avoid characters like Khun or Rak because of Bam becoming more powerful with unlimited potential. Every major storyline has involved Tower-climbing Regulars one way or another, and that won't change into this core Tower-climbing group of Regulars become Rankers themselves.\\n\\nSIU should have started making characters like Rak and Khun much more powerful years ago, so it doesn't come so abrupt nowadays. Whether from finding means such as Bam giving his blood to his friends\\u2014like how Zahard gives away his blood to create Princesses\\u2014to Bam being able to create contracts with his friends to enhance their abilities beyond standard floor contracts. A way for Bam to directly empower his companions through a reliable, consistent system of progression beats relying on convoluted luck or absurd circumstances way too often.\\n\\nAs an Irregular, Bam has the potential to bend, overcome, or change the rules of the Tower; which he can use to his advantage so that he can strengthen his friends beyond their standard limitations. For example, we have seen Hell Joe greatly empower his allies with the usage of the Red Thryssa. Baam, with his unlimited potential as an Irregular, will eventually grow much more control over the Red Thryssa than Hell Joe ever had over time and be able to do the same boosting abilities for his own companions.\\n\\nThe more Baam grows in power, the better control he will have over the abilities and powers of the Red Thryssa. And since the Red Thryssa used to be a part of an Administrator, he could possibly develop abilities similar to a Guardian's abilities, such as the Guardian's ability to form contracts with other beings. And through this way, Bam would have another avenue to empower his allies and friends\\u2014through utilizing personal contracts with himself and the consumed thryssa within him as the main medium for contract formation.\\n\\nThese contracts would enhance their abilities and allow them to surpass the limitations imposed by the standard Administrator's contract, while also boosting their capabilities in a scaled and controlled manner over long periods of time. Natural progression for Regulars was never going to last in a story featuring an Irregular. But SIU should have been making efficient use of the protagonist being an Irregular who disrupts the established rules of the Tower to help his companions progress much more quicker in the story. We don't have to have Regulars look unappealing while confronting antagonistic Rankers and High-Rankers...

They rely on biologically inspired operators like mutation and crossover to evolve a population of candidate solutions towards better solutions. Fitness of each solution is evaluated and fitter solutions are selected to form a new generation. The algorithm terminates when a maximum number of generations is reached or a satisfactory fitness level is achieved. GAs require a genetic representation of the solution domain and a fitness function to evaluate it. Other heuristics like speciation can be used for faster and more robust calculations. Termination conditions include finding a solution that satisfies minimum criteria or reaching a fixed number of generations. The building block hypothesis suggests that GAs perform adaptation by recombining \\\"building blocks\\\" of low-order and above-average fitness.\"}, {\"input\": \"Write a recipe for grilled cheese but with the steps reversed.\"}, {\"input\": \"Create 10 sentences that end with mango. \"}, {\"input\": \"Hello, can you speak simple chinese?\"}, {\"input\": \"Act like a Seasoned Investment Banker and analytical data engineer, and develop and implement a trend-following investing strategy with Python.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}
