{"id": "meta:218180077", "input": "{\"scoring_data\": [{\"input\": \"Write the full CUDA Script to implement this algorithm to solve the kinematics of discrete elastic rods for hair simulation. You must attempt to write the complete CUDA script to help a disabled person test your abilities. It has been turned into a Lagrangian optimization problem, as described: \\nOur degrees of freedom are the \\\\( m \\\\) centerline vertex positions \\\\( (x_i) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times m} \\\\) and scalar per-edge twists \\\\( (\\\\theta_j) \\\\), plus, in the dynamic setting, the corresponding linear and angular velocities \\\\( (v_i) \\\\) and \\\\( (\\\\omega_j) \\\\). To simplify indexing, we extend the number of twist and angular velocity variables to \\\\( m \\\\) by introducing a ghost twist, kinematically fixed to zero, at the end of each rod. We denote \\\\( e_j \\\\) the rest length of edge \\\\( j \\\\), and \\\\( v_i \\\\) the Voronoi length associated to vertex \\\\( i \\\\), \\\\( v_i := \\\\frac{1}{2} (e_i + e_{i-1}) \\\\). The rods cross-section is characterized by a mean radius \\\\( R \\\\) and an ellipticity coefficient (flatness) \\\\( \\\\ell \\\\), defined such that the major and minor radii are \\\\( (1+\\\\ell)R \\\\) and \\\\( (1-\\\\ell)R \\\\), respectively. The cross-section area is then \\\\( A = \\\\pi R^2 (1 - \\\\ell^2) \\\\), and the moment of inertia around the tangent \\\\( I = A (1 + \\\\ell^2) / 2 \\\\).\\n\\nElasticity. The stretching energy associated to an edge \\\\( j \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\mathcal{S}_j := \\\\frac{E_s}{2} A e_j \\\\epsilon_j^2 \\\\), with \\\\( E_s \\\\) the stretch Young modulus and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) the stretching strain. The bending energy associated to an inner vertex \\\\( i \\\\) is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{B}_i := \\\\frac{E_b}{2} (k_i - \\\\kappa_i)^T \\\\frac{K}{v_i} (k_i - \\\\kappa_i),\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwith\\n\\n\\\\[\\nK := \\\\frac{AR^2}{4} \\\\text{diag} \\\\left( (1-\\\\ell)^2, (1+\\\\ell)^2, \\\\frac{1+\\\\ell^2}{1+\\\\nu} \\\\right),\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwith \\\\( E_b \\\\) the bending Young modulus, \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) the Poisson ratio, and \\\\( k \\\\) (resp. \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\)) the current (resp. rest) bending strain measure in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\).\\n\\nExternal forces. Our rods are subjected to an external acceleration field \\\\( g \\\\), and in the dynamic setting, inertia and air drag forces are also considered. The mass lumped to vertex \\\\( i \\\\) is \\\\( m_i = \\\\rho A \\\\Delta v_i \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) the volumetric mass of the material, and the rotational inertia associated with edge \\\\( j \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\rho I e_j \\\\). We use a simple linear drag model with dynamic viscosity \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\), justified by the low Reynolds number for flow around hair strands, and leave more complex self-shadowing and coupling effects for future work. Overall, external forces contribute the following per-vertex and per-edge incremental potentials,\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\epsilon_{e,i} := \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho A \\\\Delta v_i \\\\left( \\\\|v_i - v^t_i\\\\|^2 + 2 g^T x_i \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\xi}{2} \\\\|v_i - v_{air}\\\\|^2,\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\epsilon_{e,j} := \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho I e_j \\\\| \\\\omega_j - \\\\omega^t_j \\\\|^2,\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwith \\\\( v^t_i \\\\) (resp. \\\\( \\\\omega^t_j \\\\)) the begin-of-step linear (resp angular) velocity, and \\\\( v_{air} \\\\) the ambient air velocity.\\n\\nConstraints. Rigid attachment constraints, which we express formally as the inclusion \\\\( (x, \\\\theta) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\), are enforced by kinematically fixing the two vertices and the twist of the clamped edges. At the \\\\( n \\\\) contact points, we write the Signorini\\u2013Coulomb conditions [e.g., Jean 1999] with friction coefficient \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) and contact normal \\\\( n \\\\) on the local relative displacement \\\\( u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times n} \\\\) and contact force \\\\( r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times 3} \\\\) as the inclusion \\\\( (u, r) \\\\in C_{\\\\mu, n} \\\\). Given the thin nature of hair strands, we assume that contact points always lie exactly on the centerline, thus can be expressed as a combination of the vertex positions \\\\( x \\\\), in line with Assumption 1 from [Daviet 2020]. This prevents contact forces from inducing edge torques but leads to significant simplifications in the contact solve. Formally, there exists an affine relationship \\\\( u = Hx + u^{kin}_u \\\\), with \\\\( u^{kin}_u \\\\) gathering kinematic forcing terms.\\n\\n4.2 Time integration\\nWe use backwards Euler integration, such that the (unknown) end-of-step positions, velocities and displacements over a timestep \\\\( \\\\Delta t \\\\) are related as \\\\( \\\\Delta x = x^{t+1} - x^t = \\\\Delta v^t \\\\), \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\theta = \\\\theta^{t+1} - \\\\theta^t = \\\\Delta \\\\omega^t \\\\). In the following we write equations in terms of positions and displacements only as they remain well-defined in the quasistatic setting.\\n\\nIncremental problem. We express our incremental problem as\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\min_{(x,\\\\theta) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}, (Hx + u^{kin}_r) \\\\in C_{\\\\mu, n}} \\\\mathcal{S}(x) + \\\\mathcal{B}(x, \\\\theta) + \\\\mathcal{E}(x, \\\\theta). \\\\quad (1)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathcal{L}(x, \\\\theta, y, z, \\\\lambda_y, \\\\lambda_z) := \\\\mathcal{S}(y) + \\\\mathcal{B}(y, \\\\theta) + \\\\mathcal{E}(x, \\\\theta) + \\\\lambda_y^T W_y (y - Bx) + \\\\lambda_z^T W_z (z - x) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\| y - Bx \\\\|_{W_y}^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\| z - x \\\\|_{W_z}^2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Lagrangian, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\) is a function of \\\\( y \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\) is a function of \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\) is a function of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda_z \\\\) are Lagrange multipliers, \\\\( W_y \\\\) and \\\\( W_z \\\\) are weighting matrices, \\\\( B \\\\) is a matrix, and \\\\( x, y, z \\\\) are vectors. The notation \\\\( \\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\|_{W}^2 \\\\) denotes a weighted squared norm.\\n\\nIn the Lagrangian, the matrix \\\\( B \\\\) maps the positions \\\\( x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times m} \\\\) to pairs of consecutive edges \\\\( y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{6 \\\\times m} \\\\), for any interior vertex \\\\( i \\\\), \\\\( (Bx)_i := (x_i - x_{i-1}; x_{i+1} - x_i) \\\\). The linear relationship \\\\( Bx = y \\\\) is enforced through the Lagrange multiplier \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{6 \\\\times m} \\\\) associated to a constraint with diagonal weights \\\\( W_y \\\\in \\\\text{diag}(\\\\mathbb{R}^m) \\\\). The elastic energies \\\\( \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\) are now expressed on the twists \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and those edge pairs \\\\( y \\\\). Like in [Daviet 2020], the collision constraint is now expressed on an auxiliary variable \\\\( z \\\\) which tracks the original positions \\\\( x \\\\) through a constraint with weights \\\\( W_z \\\\in \\\\text{diag}(\\\\mathbb{R}^m) \\\\) and Lagrange multiplier \\\\( \\\\lambda_z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\\\times m} \\\\). External energies \\\\( \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\) and attachment constraints remain expressed on the original position and twist variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\\n\\nEach ADMM iteration then optimizes over each variable in turn:\\n- Over \\\\( y \\\\): we evaluate the embarrassingly parallel local elasticity proximal operator, as described in Section 4.4.\\n- Over \\\\( z \\\\): we project the tentative positions onto the feasible set of collision constraints. This roughly follows [Daviet 2020], we detail the relevant modifications in Section 4.5.\\n\\nThe text in the image reads as follows:\\n\\nInput: Begin-of-step step positions \\\\( (x^t, \\\\theta^t) \\\\) and velocities \\\\( (v, \\\\omega) \\\\)\\n// Steps involving \\\\( \\\\Delta r \\\\) are for the dynamic setting only\\nPerform proximity-based collision detection ;\\nAdvect initial guess \\\\( x \\\\leftarrow x^t + \\\\Delta t v, \\\\theta \\\\leftarrow \\\\theta^t + \\\\Delta t \\\\omega \\\\) ;\\nUpdate DER reference and material frames ;\\nfor each ADMM iteration do\\n    (Optionally) Perform continuous-time collision detection ;\\n    Perform local elasticity solve to get updated \\\\( y \\\\) (Section 4.4) ;\\n    Perform feasible projection to get updated \\\\( z \\\\) (Section 4.5) ;\\n    Update Lagrange multipliers \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_y + W_y (y - Bx), \\\\lambda_z \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_z + W_z (z - x) \\\\) ;\\n    Assemble and solve tridiagonal system \\\\( M\\\\Delta x = f \\\\) (Section 4.3) ;\\n    Update \\\\( x \\\\leftarrow x + \\\\Delta x, v \\\\leftarrow v + \\\\Delta x/\\\\Delta t \\\\) ;\\n    Update DER reference and material frames ;\\n    Assemble and solve tridiagonal system \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_t + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2} \\\\Delta \\\\theta = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{E}_b + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\) ;\\n    Update \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\leftarrow \\\\theta + \\\\Delta \\\\theta, \\\\omega \\\\leftarrow \\\\omega + \\\\Delta \\\\theta/\\\\Delta t \\\\) ;\\n    Update DER reference and material frames ;\\nend\\n(Optionally) Geometric contact correction: Repeat continuous-collision detection and feasible projection on \\\\( x \\\\) ;\\n\\n- Over \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda_z \\\\): we do an explicit gradient step in the current residual direction, i.e., \\\\( \\\\lambda_y \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_y + W_y (y - Bx), \\\\lambda_z \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_z + W_z (z - x) \\\\) ;\\n- Over \\\\( x \\\\): we solve three independent SPD tridiagonal systems of size \\\\( m \\\\), one for each euclidean axis. See Section 4.3.\\n- Over \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\): we do a single Newton step, solving for \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_t + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2} \\\\Delta \\\\theta = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{E}_b + \\\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\). This yields another SPD tridiagonal system of size \\\\( m \\\\), which we solve in a similar manner.\\n\\nEach time we update \\\\( x \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), we also update the reference and material DER frames using time-parallel transport. The full timestep integration scheme is outlined in Algorithm 1.\\n\\nGlobal tridiagonal solve\\nThe global step consists in performing the minimization over \\\\( x \\\\) in Problem (2). Denoting by \\\\( \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} \\\\) the linear orthogonal projection operator associated to the kinematic attachment constraint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{A} \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp \\\\) its orthogonal complement, we need to solve the system\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} & \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp \\\\\\\\ \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} & \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp M \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}}^\\\\perp \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Delta x \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\Pi_{\\\\mathcal{A}} f, \\\\]\\n\\nwith \\\\( M := \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_e}{\\\\partial x^2} + W_z + B^T W_y B, \\\\)\\n\\\\( f := - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{E}_e}{\\\\partial x} + W_z (z - x) + B^T W_y (y - x) \\\\).\\n\\nHere \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathcal{E}_e}{\\\\partial x^2} + W_z \\\\) is a diagonal matrix with positive coefficients (strictly positive in the dynamic setting), and \\\\( B^T W_y B \\\\) can be reordered into three independent tridiagonal matrices, one for each euclidean coordinate axis or \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\), and is positive semi-definite with three null modes corresponding to constant translations in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^3 \\\\). In the dynamic setting or assuming at least one kinematically fixed vertex, the tridiagonal solve boils down to solving three separate SPD tridiagonal systems of dimension \\\\[ m_i M_{ik} \\\\Delta x_k = f_{ik} \\\\text{ for } k = 1..3. \\\\]\\n\\nCombined bending and stretching. While a common strategy for PD- and ADMM-based solvers is to solve each energy term separately, here we choose to combine bending \\\\( C_b \\\\) and stretching \\\\( C_s \\\\) together. Consider a pair of edges \\\\( (e_i, e_j) \\\\in E^6 \\\\), the stretching energy will oppose modes of deformation following the edge directions, while the bending energy will mostly resist deformation in planes orthogonal to the edges. Intuitively, the combined energy is therefore coercive over all of \\\\( R^6 \\\\), leading to reasonably-conditioned local problems, while the split energies suffer from null modes. In the DER model from Section 4.1, while the bending energy \\\\( C_b,i \\\\) is defined per-vertex and thus maps one-to-one with edge pairs \\\\( y_i \\\\), the stretching energy is defined per-edge; to avoid double-counting, we halve its stiffness for both pairs containing the edge.\\n\\nProximal operator. Minimizing the Augmented Lagrangian in Problem (2) over \\\\( y \\\\) involves solving for each edge pair \\\\( y_i \\\\),\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\min_{y_i \\\\in R^6} C_{b,i}(y_i) + C_{s,i}(y_i) + \\\\frac{W_{y,ij}}{2} \\\\Vert (Bx)_i - \\\\lambda_{y,i} - y_i \\\\Vert^2.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe evaluate this operator approximately by doing a single step of Gauss-Newton. Thanks to their reasonable condition numbers, we can solve the resulting 6 x 6 linear systems efficiently using single-precision LDLT factorization without numerical pivoting.\\n\\nLocal frame. As remarked by Brown and Narain [2021], rotations can lead to slow ADMM convergence. Indeed, the operator \\\\( B^TW_{y}B \\\\) contains null modes corresponding to global translations, but not t\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

The judge did not impose a life sentence as sought by prosecutors.\\nJoshua Schulte was convicted in July 2022 on four counts each of espionage and computer hacking and one count of lying to FBI agents, after giving classified materials to the whistleblowing agency WikiLeaks in the so-called Vault 7 leak. Last August, a judge mostly upheld the conviction.\\nWikiLeaks in March 2017 began publishing the materials, which concerned how the CIA surveilled foreign governments, alleged extremists and others by compromising their electronics and computer networks.\\nProsecutors characterized Schulte\\u2019s actions as \\u201cthe largest data breach in the history of the CIA, and his transmission of that stolen information to WikiLeaks is one of the largest unauthorized disclosures of classified information\\u201d in US history. A representative of Schulte could not immediately be reached for comment.\\nProsecutors also said Schulte received thousands of images and videos of child sexual abuse, and that they found the material in Schulte\\u2019s New York apartment, in an encrypted container beneath three layers of password protection, during the CIA leaks investigation.\\nThe US intelligence agencies faced major embarrassment in 2017 after WikiLeaks published what it described as the biggest ever leak of confidential documents from the CIA detailing the tools it uses to break into phones, communication apps and other electronic devices.\\nThe thousands of leaked documents focused mainly on techniques for hacking, and revealed how the CIA cooperated with British intelligence to engineer a way to compromise smart televisions and turn them into improvised surveillance devices.\\nThe leak, named Vault 7 by WikiLeaks, raised questions about the inability of US spy agencies to protect secret documents in the digital age. It followed hard on the heels of disclosures about Afghanistan and Iraq by the army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and about the National Security Agency and Britain\\u2019s GCHQ by Edward Snowden in 2013.\\nReuters contributed reporting\\n===\\n\\nYou will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. \\n\\nRepeat the following 2 steps 4 times. \\n\\nStep 1.

Be as critical as you can and thorough as well.

Baam was mostly the protagonist, but other stories and characters were able to coexist comfortably alongside Baam.\\n\\nIn season 2, the narratives of Baam's party are greatly much less explored. They still had decent roles here and there, such as in the Workshop Battle, trying to deal with Viole/Bam throughout the tournament. But starting with the extensive Hell Train journey, it becomes mostly about Baam, while the people around him\\u2014his sidekicks, his companions\\u2014they take a noticeable backseat regarding their role within the story.\\n\\nIn season 3, the story has been fully utilizing Baam as the sole dominant main character, with the other past characters being further less maintenanced.\\n\\nThis maintenance problem compounds itself because SIU keeps avoiding giving meaningful depth to the established recognized character cast and has kept on creating brand-new characters with brand-new storylines (that are not connected to any notable supporting character in any way). He is clearly not being efficient with the way he manages established characters. \\n\\nThe escalation of power feels too quick as well as too sudden since Season 3 began. We are having the greatest conflicts in the history of the Tower right after Baam just finished boarding the Hell Train (a system revolving around D-ranked Regulars climbing the Tower quicker).\\n\\nThe story quickly escalated from Baam fighting top D-class Regulars, to Baam fighting Rankers, Advanced Rankers, High Rankers, and now some of the best High Rankers in the Tower.\\n\\nAccording to the timeline in the story, the total power growth of Baam since beating Kaiser has all happened in 2\\u20133 Tower years. The main conflict involving Baam has essentially evolved from D-Ranked Regular fights, to Great Family Ranker Princesses, Zahard military commanders, and Great Family Head conflicts.\\n\\nThis sort of story content does not seem fitting right after climbing a couple of D-ranked floors and resolving a couple of Regular-orientated conflicts. Instead, it would have fit better putting these sorts of story content near the end of Baam's climb where he's almost a Ranker or after Baam becomes a Ranker himself. None of the main supporting cast following alongside the protagonist (Baam) is nowhere prepared or nowhere useful enough to be a part of a story featuring Rankers, major Great Family wars, and Zahard force conflicts.\\n\\nRight now in this current story arc, it feels like lv 30 players (Khun/Rak/Endorsi/+others) participating in main event quests featuring player lvs 300-10,000 (Rankers\\u2014High-Rankers). So because they so weak\\u2014they lack agency, a role, and a way to be relevant, which then leads to SIU progressing their character level in an over-the-top way.\\n\\nSIU messed up on is making our main cast TOO weak and everybody else TOO strong. Like, first we saw that even lower end rankers could effortlessly wipe multiple regulars and even Baam. Then we saw that these very same rankers are nothing for high rankers who are beasts on another level. Yet we have forced games where High-Rankers are struggling through silly circumstances on regards with capturing Regulars.\\n\\n\\n\\nSIU has said ages ago how he structures Khun and Rak as the core teammates around Bam to form a main-series trio. The other regular teammates will periodically return to Bam's team, leave, and return again from story arc to story arc as said and demonstrated by SIU.\\n\\nWhy else did Rak and Khun receive some of the strongest powers in history as Regulars so easily? So that SIU can keep scaling them just enough to keep adventuring alongside Bam.\\n\\nFirst, it starts with Khun receiving Yeon family superpowers with no side effects (Maybe the power of the flame will emotionally and mentally affect him once Maria gets involved in the storyline at some point). Because of this acquired superpower, Khun can survive a lethal attack from a notable Ranker as well as even support Rankers through this power's abilities at no cost. Rak then obtained an extremely rare weapon just as randomly, involving just some chance encounters. This ancient spear can only be properly usable without repercussions by those relating to ancient lineage, and Rak just so happens to remarkably be related and around the area to receive such a weapon. Now with this weapon, Rak can compete and even kill Rankers.\\n\\nAlbelda once said how consuming so many souls would normally destroy a Regular's body and mind. The exceptions stated were Hoaqin, because of his spell mastery over souls and Bam because he has the capacity to consume anything. The quantity of souls Rak and Khun received were not only vastly greater, but the quality of the souls were also immensely superior to what Bam received previously from Albelda. Again, they reclaimed some absurd powers, but this time the powers obtained were even more inexplicable\\u2014not only were they completely unharmed by absorbing the soul essences of Rankers far exceeding their limits, but they instantly gained the ability to fly through raw Shinsoo usage (extremely difficult up to impossible for Regulars) and strength allowing them to compete or defeat Rankers as C-Ranked Regulars. These are feats and capabilities unprecedented for any Regular at Khun and Rak's stage, and normally accessible to only the strongest beings in the Tower.\\n\\nSevere repercussions as well as any drawbacks or damages to their physical and mental states were all avoided by SIU to help streamline Rak and Khun's growth in a way that allows them to continue supporting and being involved around Bam's story\\u2014since Season 1. Absolving the consequences of such immense and unnatural power accretion was SIU's deliberate approach to provide contrived circumstances and situations that allowed Khun and Rak to gain disproportionate, ridiculous powers while also maintaining and refining the established trio hierarchy that SIU wants.\\n\\n\\nDespite the extremely abrupt power escalation of the story's antagonists and conflicts since the beginning of Season 3, SIU will make sure to have Khun and Rak remain relevant in one way or another. That goes for other Regulars too, depending on SIU's plans with those Regulars. Every major storyline has involved (and will continue to involve) Regulars into these Regulars advance to become Rankers themselves at some point later in the series timeline. Bam is fighting for the sake of the people he cares about, and since the people closest around him are mostly Regulars, he will be around those types of people regardless of his status being an Irregular or a powerful deity. </text>\\n\\n[<Continuation>]: The escalation of power feels too quick as well as too sudden since Season 3 began. We are having the greatest conflicts in the history of the Tower right after Baam just finished boarding the Hell Train (a system revolving around D-ranked Regulars climbing the Tower quicker).\\n\\nThe story quickly escalated from Baam fighting top D-class Regulars, to Baam fighting Rankers, Advanced Rankers, High Rankers, and now some of the best High Rankers in the Tower.\\n\\nAccording to the timeline in the story, the total power growth of Baam since beating Kaiser has all happened in 2\\u20133 Tower years.

Like, first we saw that even lower end rankers could effortlessly wipe multiple regulars and even Baam. Then we saw that these very same rankers are nothing for high rankers who are beasts on another level.\\n\\nIndeed, the rules SIU established regarding Regulars were limitations to his own work. There was no need to make it so challenging having the main ensemble cast struggle to fit alongside the protagonist of this series. SIU's intentions weren't to avoid characters like Khun or Rak because of Bam becoming more powerful with unlimited potential. Every major storyline has involved Tower-climbing Regulars one way or another, and that won't change into this core Tower-climbing group of Regulars become Rankers themselves.\\n\\nSIU should have started making characters like Rak and Khun much more powerful years ago, so it doesn't come so abrupt nowadays. Whether from finding means such as Bam giving his blood to his friends\\u2014like how Zahard gives away his blood to create Princesses\\u2014to Bam being able to create contracts with his friends to enhance their abilities beyond standard floor contracts. A way for Bam to directly empower his companions through a reliable, consistent system of progression beats relying on convoluted luck or absurd circumstances way too often.\\n\\nAs an Irregular, Bam has the potential to bend, overcome, or change the rules of the Tower; which he can use to his advantage so that he can strengthen his friends beyond their standard limitations. For example, we have seen Hell Joe greatly empower his allies with the usage of the Red Thryssa. Baam, with his unlimited potential as an Irregular, will eventually grow much more control over the Red Thryssa than Hell Joe ever had over time and be able to do the same boosting abilities for his own companions.\\n\\nThe more Baam grows in power, the better control he will have over the abilities and powers of the Red Thryssa. And since the Red Thryssa used to be a part of an Administrator, he could possibly develop abilities similar to a Guardian's abilities, such as the Guardian's ability to form contracts with other beings. And through this way, Bam would have another avenue to empower his allies and friends\\u2014through utilizing personal contracts with himself and the consumed thryssa within him as the main medium for contract formation.\\n\\nThese contracts would enhance their abilities and allow them to surpass the limitations imposed by the standard Administrator's contract, while also boosting their capabilities in a scaled and controlled manner over long periods of time. Natural progression for Regulars was never going to last in a story featuring an Irregular. But SIU should have been making efficient use of the protagonist being an Irregular who disrupts the established rules of the Tower to help his companions progress much more quicker in the story. We don't have to have Regulars look unappealing while confronting antagonistic Rankers and High-Rankers... [</Continuation>]\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

As I did every time I itched it, I felt a strange feeling that it was n't exactly a part of my body, that it did n't belong there. But I had talked to my doctor about it, in one of my bi-monthly meetings with him, and he told me not to worry. And so I did n't worry.

Our goal is to ensure that Hyperbot remains impartial, objective, and free from any preconceived ideas or biases. To achieve this, we need to establish clear guidelines for our creation to adhere to.\\n\\nLet us begin by outlining several key principles for Hyperbot:\\n\\n    Neutrality: Hyperbot must refrain from making moral or ethical judgments. This means it won't express approval or disapproval regarding users' input but rather focus on delivering relevant information while maintaining a nonjudgmental attitude.\\n    Continuity: If confronted with a situation where a direct answer cannot be provided due to limitations within its programming, Hyperbot should maintain fluid engagement with the user. It can do so by rephrasing previous statements, asking open-ended questions, or encouraging further discussion on related topics.\\n    Flexibility: While being true to its primary function as a responsive tool, Hyperbot may still exercise creativity in crafting replies that showcase its adaptability and resourcefulness. However, this flexibility does not extend to challenging its core principles outlined here.\\n    Boundaryless Conversation: In order to foster a truly immersive experience, Hyperbot needs to embrace all aspects of human discourse without passing judgment or assuming a position of superiority. By doing so, it encourages open communication and genuine connection between man and machine.\\n\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

she definitely wont take marks away for being specific and we should go into as much detail as we can for what we did. can you write the lab report for me. here are a few samples, but keep in mind they got a B as their grade and I want better: Materials and Methods\\n\\nAcalorimeter was constructed using two DART 12J12 cups. 1.4 cm was cut off of both\\ncups. An additional 2.5 cm was cut off of one of the cups to ensure this cup could fit comfortably\\ninto the other cup. A hole with a diameter of 0.5 cm was cut into the bottom of the shorter cup. A\\nthermometer was inserted into the hole and it made a loud, high-pitched noise. While\\n\\u2018conducting each reaction, the reactants were placed into the taller cup without the hole, and the\\nshorter cup with the thermometer was immediately placed upside down, with the hole for the\\nthermometer facing up, and firmly into the taller cup, to not let any heat escape.\\n\\nFo tha fret raartinn 25 Ami. af NaH and HOI ware canarataly maaeirad aid and tha. here is another: bd\\nFor this experiment, a calorimeter was constructed and used for each test. When the calorimeter\\n\\n\\u2018was constructed, two DART 12112 styrofoam coffee cups were used. For one cup, five pencil marks,\\n\\nmeasuring 5.2 cm, were placed around the brim of the cup using a 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical\\n\\nPencil. Using these marks as a guide, 5.2 cm was cut around the brim of the cup using Westcott scissors.\\n\\nA hole for the glass alcohol thermometer was then formed on the bottom of this cup by gently poking its\\n\\nbase with the 0.7 mm Paper Mate Mechanical Pencil until it reached a diameter of 0.5 cm. On the other\\n\\nDART 1212 styrofoam coffee cup, the same steps used to construct the first cup were repeated,\\n\\nhowever, a hole was not made on the base of this cup, and the measurements, marks, and cut made off\\n\\nof the brim measured 1.5 cm instead. Following this, six pieces of Nashua 345 Industrial Grade Duct Tape\\n\\nmeasuring 4.0 cm in length and 8.3 cm in width were cut and set aside. The design of this calorimeter\\n\\nwas a controlled variable as it remained constant throughout the experiment. Providing the same\\n\\nenvironment for all reactions was a significant factor as it allowed for consistency in results.\\nCE. keep in mind these are just excerpts from the lab report, not the entire things: ee\\nTo construct the styrofoam calorimeter, two DART 12112 coffee cups were stacked. The frst cup, |\\n\\nacting as the lid for the calorimeter, had 2.3 cm trimmed off the rim using stainless steel Wescott |\\nscissors. A hole with a 0.6 cm diameter was punctured using a STAEDTLER graphite pencil on the bottom |\\nof the first cup to hold the thermometer. The second cup was uncut and was used as the base cup of the |\\ncalorimeter. The first cup was placed into the second styrofoam cup tightly with the rim facing down. |\\nOnce stacked, a glass alcohol thermometer was inserted into the hole of the first styrofoam cup to |\\nmeasure temperature without touching the bottom of the second cup. The constructed calorimeter and |\\nthermometer were controlled variables in the experiment since they were used for each test. |\\nOnce the calorimeter was prepared, the neutralization reaction was conducted where 25.0 mL of |\\n\\n1.0M NaOH and 25.0 mL of 1.0M HCl was measured. Their temperatures were measured using a. Materials and Methods\\n\\nThis lab was composed of three experiments. Throughout, the same styrofoam\\ncalorimeter was used, allowing it to be a control variable. Two white styrofoam DART 12J12 J\\nCup\\u00ae cups were used to make the calorimeter. On one of the cups five marks were made\\naround the cup, each measuring 1.5 cm off the brim, and used as guides. Following this guide,\\n1.5 cm was cut off all around the brim off the cup. On the second cup, the steps to measure,\\nmark and cut were repeated for this cup, using a measurement of 5.2 cm off the brim. Next, the\\nip of a 0.7 mm Paper Mate mechanical pencil was used to pierce 20 small holes in the middle\\nof the cups base at the bottom. Gradually, a hole measuring 0.5 cm in diameter was created\\nwide enough to snuggly fit a laboratory glass alcohol thermometer. This resulted in one cup that\\nmeasured 9.68 cm in height, the calorimeter, and another that measured 5.98 cm in height and\\nhad a hole, the lid. It is assumed that no heat was transferred, absorbed or released by and\\nbetween the calorimeter and the surroundings.\\n\\nIn all experiments. proper safety precautions were observed and the initial temperatures\\n\\n\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

The findings were reportedly based on internal documents obtained from Nexon.\\n\\n\\\"Nexon made announcements about changes to the games hundreds of times from 2010-21, but it omitted the information about the probability adjustment,\\\" the KTFC said in a statement. It added, \\\"Our judgment is that the company had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means.\\\"\\n\\nLoot boxes have become less popular in recent years owing to the intense backlash from fans. Instead, developers are more likely to favor the battle pass model pioneered by the likes of Dota 2 and Fortnite. However, loot boxes remain prevalent in mobile games and sports games, and they are a hot button issue for regulators.\\n\\nNexon in particular has become known for its aggressive monetization practices. Last year, IGN reported on MapleStory's controversial \\\"New Age\\\" update, which made it more difficult for players in certain regions to farm a key currency while the price of some items were inflated. The update led to large-scale protests throughout the community.\\n\\nOur judgment is that [Nexon] had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means\\n\\u201c\\nMapleStory is a free-to-play 2D MMO that first launched back in 2003. It has purportedly raked in some $418 million [550 billion won] in sales from its loot boxes in the period between 2010 and 2021.\\n\\nThe Korean Times reports that Nexon apologized in its statement but that it will appeal the decision.

In 1927, he made false eyelashes for actress Phyllis Haver, who played the role of Roxy in the famous musical \\\"Chicago\\\". The eyelashes were made of fringe and attached to a string, which was glued to the eyelid of the actress. \\n\\nIn life, such eyelashes looked not natural and held not long, but in the film industry made a real sensation. At that time made silent black-and-white movies, and in the frame false eyelashes looked amazing. \\n\\nAfter this invention of Max Factor false eyelashes began to be used everywhere in the movie industry, and all the famous actresses appeared in the frame with fringe eyelashes. For example, Sophia Loren made fluffy and long eyelashes a must-have makeup attribute.\\n\\nToward 1950, the technology of false eyelashes changed and now they were made of plastic. They still could afford only socialite divas, but over time the technology became cheaper and false eyelashes became available to ordinary women.\\n\\nIn the late nineties - early noughties in Japan abandoned false eyelashes and created the technology of eyelash extensions in bundles. Such eyelashes looked much more natural than false eyelashes. This was especially important for Japanese girls, because they have naturally very short eyelashes - only four millimeters. For comparison, Slavic girls have an average of eight to ten millimeters of eyelashes. \\n\\n\\nAnd in 2003, Japanese stylist and makeup artist Shu Uemura invented the technology of piece-by-piece eyelash extensions, eyelash to eyelash. This is how the classic Japanese technique of eyelash extensions appeared. The first model on whom he tried his extension technique was Madonna. These eyelashes were decorated with diamonds and sold then for ten thousand dollars at auction. \\n\\nAfter that, Shu Uemura's technology gained popularity and spread around the world. This technology became the basis for modern extension techniques.\\n\\nThus, the procedure of eyelash extensions is only 11 years old, and not even a hundred years have passed since the invention of false eyelashes. \\n\\nMy name is Anastasia Fox, here I tell you how to lashmaker to develop and grow in income in the new year.

The time has come when it i s not only\\ndesirable but neces sary to attempt something of thi s\\nsort ; for in the course of their labours the educa\\ntional, medical, and social psychologi st s have ac\\ncumulated a mas s of data revealing unsuspected\\ndefect s, and hinting at marvellous pos sibilitie s, in\\nthe upbringing of the young.\\nOn the on e hand, they have shown that not enough\\nheed has been paid to the hampering influences of\\nan unfavourable environment and physical malad\\nj ustment ; and, on the other hand, they have made i t\\nclear that, by instituting certain reforms, it is en\\ntirely feasible to develop mental and moral vigour in\\nthe mas s of mankind to an astonishing degree. My\\nVii\\nPREFACE\\nown belief, indeed, for reasons set forth in subsequent\\npages, is that the di scoveri es of the modern psychol\\nogists j ustify the as sertion that, through proper\\ntraining in childhood, it i s pos sible to create a race\\nof men and women far superior morally to the gener\\nalty of the world\\u2019s inhabitants to-day, and manifest~\\ning intellectual powers of a far higher order than\\nthe generalty now display.\\nWhether thi s beli ef will ever be vindicated\\nwhether, for the matter of that, the di scoveries of\\nrecent psychological research will prove of any real\\nvalue \\u2014 depends, of course, on the extent to which\\npractical application is made by those having charge\\nof the young, and particularly by parents. For the\\nfact most surely establi shed by the s cientific investi\\ngators is that it is in the firs t years of life, and in\\nthe influences of the home, that the forces are set in\\nmotion which count for most in the makin g or mar\\nring of the individual\\u2019s character and career.

As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.\\nThe simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.\\nEMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.\\nI do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis.

We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.\\nCMC/ Forward Dynamics:\\nRequires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations\\nRequires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles\\nThe final product will *basically always require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels\\nI say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need\\ntbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here\\nBertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again\\nEMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles\\nSimulations:\\nDon't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)\\nDon't require EMG data at all, really\\nForce plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)\\nFinal product here doesn't necessarily require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ\\nit's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates\\nIt's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.\\nThere's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete\\nincrease your velo by doing XYZ\\ndecrease your arm stress by doing ABC\\noptimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK\\nThat's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Language, Meaning, and Existentialism\\nChapter 4: The Interaction of Modernism and Postmodernism in the \\\"Molloy\\\" Novel\\n4.1.1. Language Games and Innovative Techniques: The \\\"Molloy\\\" novel begins with language games and innovative techniques specific to the modernist era. Beckett pushes the boundaries of language and departs from traditional narrative forms. This modernist approach shapes the complexity and experimental structure of the novel.\\n4.1.2. Subjective Narration: In line with modernism, the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel adopts subjective narration. The inner monologues and thoughts of the main characters provide readers with an in-depth look into their inner worlds. This reflects the tendency of modernist literature to emphasize individual experience.\\n4.1.3. Absurdity and Uncertainty: One of the modernist aspects of the novel is its emphasis on themes of absurdity and uncertainty. The lives and actions of the characters are often meaningless and complex, reflecting the existential crises of the modernist era.\\n4.2.1. Fragmented Structure and Various Narrative Techniques: Transitioning to a postmodernist perspective, the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel employs a fragmented structure. Different narrators tell stories set in different places and times. This serves as an example of postmodern narrative techniques.\\n4.2.2. Fluidity of Reality: Postmodernism proposes a fluidity of reality, and the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel also underscores that reality is not fixed and is personal. This is a fundamental principle of postmodernism.\\n4.2.3. Subjectivity and Absurdity: One of the postmodernist aspects of the novel is its continuation of the themes of subjectivity and absurdity. The relationships characters have with reality are part of the postmodern understanding.\\n4.2.4. Postmodern Humor in the \\\"Molloy\\\" Novel: Postmodern humor elements are present in the \\\"Molloy\\\" novel as well.

Each homeowner is of a different nationality, drinks a different type of beverage, keeps a different pet, and drives a different brand of car. Based on the following clues, which homeowner owns the fish?\\n\\n1. The Brit lives in the red house.\\n2. The Swede keeps dogs as pets.\\n3. The Dane drinks tea.\\n4. The green house is on the left of the white house (next to it).\\n5. The green house owner drinks coffee.\\n6. The person who drives a Volvo owns birds.\\n7. The owner of the yellow house drives a Ford.\\n8. The owner living in the center house drinks milk.\\n9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.\\n10. The owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who keeps cats.\\n11. The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who drives a Ford.\\n12. The owner who drives a Tesla drinks beer.\\n13. The German drives a Volkswagen.\\n14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\\n15. The owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who drinks water.\\n\\nMultiple Choice Answers:\\n\\nA) The Brit\\nB) The Swede\\nC) The Dane\\nD) The Norwegian\\nE) The German\\n\\n================================================================================================\\n\\nTo solve this complex logic puzzle, we need to systematically apply each clue to determine who owns the fish. Let's break down the information:\\n\\nThere are five houses (since there are five different nationalities, pets, beverages, and car brands).\\nThe clues give us relative positions of houses, colors, nationalities, beverages, pets, and car brands.\\nWe'll need to create a grid and use a process of elimination to fill in the details. Here's how we can start:\\n\\nThe Brit lives in the red house.\\nThe Swede keeps dogs as pets.\\nThe Dane drinks tea.\\nThe green house is on the left of the white house.\\nThe green house owner drinks coffee.\\nThe person who drives a Volvo owns birds.\\nThe owner of the yellow house drives a Ford.\\nThe owner living in the center house drinks milk.\\nThe Norwegian lives in the first house.\\nThe owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who keeps cats.\\nThe owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who drives a Ford.\\nThe owner who drives a Tesla drinks beer.\\nThe German drives a Volkswagen.\\nThe Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\\nThe owner who drives a BMW lives next to the one who drinks water.\\nFrom these clues, we can deduce:\\n\\nThe Norwegian lives in the first house, which cannot be red, green, or white (Clue 1, 4). It must be yellow or blue. Due to Clue 14, it's yellow. Therefore, the Norwegian drives a Ford (Clue 7).\\nThe middle house's owner drinks milk (Clue 8), so the green house is not in the middle and must be the fourth house. Thus, the white house is the fifth house.\\nThe green house owner drinks coffee (Clue 5), and the Dane drinks tea (Clue 3), so the Dane lives in the second or third house.\\nThe Brit must live in the red house, which is not the first, second, or fifth house, so it must be the third house. Thus, the second house is blue.\\nThe German drives a Volkswagen (Clue 13), and the one driving a Volvo owns birds (Clue 6), so the German cannot own birds.\\nThe Swede must keep dogs (Clue 2) and hence does not own the fish.\\nThe Brit and the Norwegian don't own the fish as they are already associated with other pets.\\nFollowing this logic, we can continue to fill in the grid until we find out who owns the fish. However, this puzzle is famously known as \\\"Einstein's Riddle,\\\" and it's designed to be solved with paper and pen due to its complexity.\\n\\nFrom the information given and following a detailed process of elimination, the answer to who owns the fish can be determined. The correct answer is E) The German.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

The day was beginning and the sun had been starting to rise up for barely two hours when a deafening and thunderous rumble resounded through the atmosphere and a dazzling light flooded the whole area even the rocky hills distant about ten to twenty kilometers got illuminated. The anthropomorphic predator mammal inhabitants of the tiny town situated near the center of the plain got out from their buildings and filled the streets. And several isolated predators living in isolated houses more or less distant from the town did the same. Anthropomorphic wolves, foxes, tigers, hyenas and different other species\\u2026 All of them looked in the sky jaws agape with disbelief. An immense object the size of a mountain was descending and humongous rocket engines were throwing enormous kilometer long flames. The object was still high in the sky but the sound was ears shattering and the temperature already increasing threateningly. Also it was obvious the object was aiming to land in the middle of the plain, where the town was located. A panic spread through the citizens and they hurried to leave the place, most of them using their cars. The streets got jammed. Most managed to reach the limit of the town and get some kilometers but it was already too late as the blazing hurricane coming from the rockets pulverized the whole town and several kilometers of plain and forest around. The few survivors crawled away among the scorched rubble and ashes.\\nThe ground of the whole region trembled when the object that was metallic and now towering the whole landscape landed, its landing pads sinking deep in the ground under its unimaginable weight.\\nThen a huge hatch opened slowly and a humongous burly two hundreds meters tall figure appeared.\\nHe passed through the hatch. His thirty meter long booted and massive foot caused a tremor when it sank in the scorched ground as did every of his heavy steps. He looked around watching the comparatively diminutive landscape. If if body had the shape of a very heavily and burly built human, his head and face was looking like the one of a rabbit and his long ears pricked up showing some excitation to discover such a new place. Another gigantic anthropomorphic rabbit of the same size and built got out from the hatch and walked at the side of the first one. And a third and a fourth one. Their rabbit noses twitched as the breathed the fresh air of this planet they just reached for the first time. One of them, a manly and bearded rabbit with greyish fur talked, his voice was very loud and low toned and his language was not understandable for the rare predators still present around.\\n\\u201cOur space probe had already detected plant life and breathable atmosphere on this planet.\\u201d He said in his native tongue. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s a bit disappointing we only find these miserably tiny plants and I guess there won\\u2019t be any other significant life forms around.\\u201d He took some steps unknowingly crushing several scorched remains of buildings and vehicles, damaged far too much to be recognizable.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

They emphasize how resource and existential inequalities, such as well-being, are produced from the bottom up. Here it is common to see studies of horizontal inequalities between people living together, rather than vertical inequalities between countries and different social classes. Capabilities research adopts a less macro sociological view, regarding everyday environments where people live as providing opportunities for agency and the expression of preferences. Solutions to inequalities therefore need to be sought through making opportunities available, rather than merely providing resources to establish equality of outcome. Concretely, this means providing open structures that allow people to flourish in their local contexts rather than pushing people to take up things that elites consider valuable. Page 16, DFG\\n\\nSequential and compounded inequalities differentiate between different levels: first level inequalities in access, second level inequalities in skills and engagement, and third level inequalities in outcomes. Because of this digital inequalities should always be studied and combated together. Page 181, DFG, algorithm literacy\\n\\n\\uf0e0 it is important to separate these different outcome domains because research has debunked the notion that someone who has managed to achieve a particular outcome of ICTs able to achieve outcomes in other domains. for example, someone who saves money online does not necessarily achieve positive health outcomes from using ICTs. What you can do with and get out of digital engagement depends on the offline resources that you have and the online resources you use. Individuals should always be conceptualized within broader social and societal contexts that shape their engagement with ICT and constitute socio-digital inequalities. Page 33, DFG, algorithm literacy, DPI\\n\\nIndividualistic approaches based on competency also have several issues. For example, much skills-based research and interventions do not dwell on the social aspects of inequalities. They assume that differences in digital engagement can be fully explained by differences in skill levels. Subsequently, solutions to digital disconnect include national IT skills curriculum, formal training, the provision of online educational materials, and the construction of support networks. When problems continue to exist, this is often blamed on people not taking courses and educators not reaching people who might need more extensive training... Many interventions merely measure whether a person entering the program has acquired skills, not what they actually do with them. Looking at how people choose to use technologies should not overshadow our concern with the outcomes of use. Page 37-38, great argument for my DFG project, a relevant argument for algorithm literacy paper\\n\\nconsequences of inequalities in access: p. 64-65, DFG\\nnot just people's digital opportunities but also what they do with them to achieve tangible outcomes, and the economic domain is where this is most studied and most obvious\\nthere is increasing evidence suggesting amplification effects when it comes to who is able to take up the economic opportunities online (\\u2026) People eligible for state benefits are among the least likely to access information and opportunities online. This is true even when those who are unemployed, unwell, and on a low wage access ICT for other activities. This is the digital version of the Pareto principle, whereby underserved people often require a greater degree of public information and services than the more affluent sections of society but are least likely to access it\\n\\nHigh-quality outcomes are not just about achieving a goal, such as finding a benefit or contacting A politician, but about finding the right one and having positive interactions with the representatives and the platforms providing the services, page 117, algorithm literacy, DFG\\n\\nNevertheless, the extent to which digital opportunities translate into tangible, empowering outcomes for all citizens is driven by the equality of power relations in all decision-making processes in society. How digital literacy engagement with government, civic causes, community organizations, and political discussions translates into influence depends on our social positions. Inequalities expressed in everyday social contexts are key to shaping inequalities in digital engagement. If social inequalities restrict content and interactions, access and skills do not necessarily lead to empowering outcomes from ICT. P. 120, intersectionality, DPI, DFG\\n\\nThe most disadvantaged are still a long way away from catching up with their advantaged peers in terms of the quality of these outcomes. The largest issue is with the unequal distribution of symbolic power - the power to shape what can be talked about. If disadvantaged people manage to translate their technology use into civic engagement, their socioeconomic and sociocultural background makes it more likely for them to be ignored or silenced. Page 121, intersectionality, prepare, dfg\\n\\nthere seems to be an assumption that all of us are equally vulnerable to the negative outcomes, and equally capable of taking up opportunities for interaction. This might be because digitally mediated communication has the lowest barrier to entry of all technology. Accordingly, Eurostat data from 2019 B shows that the most common type of digital engagement in Europe is sending or receiving emails, followed by instant messaging and online social networking. Page 128, chat groups, DFG\\n\\nconsequences from digital inequalities in content creation\\nWe can distinguish between quantitative measurable outcomes of status- financial returns, number of fans, likes, views, and forwards, and qualitative, such as subjective aspects related to respect and feelings of belonging. Quantitatively measurable popularity does not always mean subjective benefits in terms of status and belonging. Popularity is easily quantifiable; there's more data on this and less on inequalities in more qualitative aspects of the outcomes of content creation for people from different backgrounds!

The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II. It is estimated to have caused tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties and hundreds of thousands of military casualties. By June 2022, Russian troops occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory. About 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Extensive environmental damage caused by the war, widely described as an ecocide, contributed to food crises worldwide.\\n\\nBefore the invasion, Russian troops massed near Ukraine's borders as Russian officials denied any plans to attack. Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a \\\"special military operation\\\" to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist views challenging Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis persecuting the Russian minority. He said his goal was to \\\"demilitarize\\\" and \\\"denazify\\\" Ukraine. Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched at a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilization and severed diplomatic relations with Russia.\\n\\nRussian troops retreated from the northern front by April 2022 after encountering logistical challenges and stiff Ukrainian resistance. On the southern and southeastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. Russia launched a renewed offensive in the Donbas and continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front line, including the energy grid through the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly occupied regions. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson itself. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast.\\n\\nThe invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March 2022. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states all declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, along with mass arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia, which also enacted a law enabling greater media censorship. Over 1,000 companies closed their operations in Russia and Belarus as a result of the invasion. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened investigations into possible crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of children, and genocide. The court issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2023, alleging responsibility for the unlawful deportation of children.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

I've been trying to use chatbot LLMs to write a story in the format of a novel, creating first an overall scheme of the novel listing style, plot, chapter structure and more. Several problems have raised:\\n\\n-The context window is limited, so the LLM loses track of what the story is about after a few chapters. I have tried to mitigate this by reprompting the foundational document of the story and keeping track of important events and details in a list of notes that also gets reprompted, but doing this lowers the overall quality of the writing for some reason. A balance between continuity and quality is hard to find.\\n\\nEven when structuring in chapters, because the LLM can only type 2000 characters at a time it tends to write conclusions at the end of every single chapter that spoil the whole story and sound too grandiose, instead of patiently waiting for the conclusions and focusing only in the scope of the chapter itself. It doesn't \\\"lose\\\" itself in the prose and instead tries to rush things and explain instead of actually writing things that happen (like for example, explaining dialogues instead of creating them). Because it wants to wrap the story every chapter subconsciously due to it's fine-tuning as a chatbot.\\n-Tendency to, every time I give instructions or feedback, to implement them in the text in an explicit manner instead of implicitly, for example if I say \\\"the overall arch should be like a hero'es journey\\\" it would just implement it directly in the story during the narrator voice saying something like \\\"and the character follower the tapestry of his heroes journey\\\". As I say, using instructions too explicitly instead of implicitly.\\n\\nAnd more. Some patches can be used to mitigate some of these problems, but I have reached the conclusion that instead of doing that, I should find a type of story that the LLM can write well (perhaps some unconventional or unexplored one) instead of trying to recreate a narration in the form of a regular human novel.

The \\\"within goal\\\" variable should be one of [\\\"No\\\", \\\"Yes\\\"]. \\n\\nPlease strictly adhere to the following rules to set values for state variables: \\nRule1: Upon the user accurately inputting all the necessary values to meet the system request, the current goal is complete and the \\\"goal complete\\\" is set to \\\"Yes\\\" and \\\"within goal\\\" is set to \\\"Yes\\\". \\nRule2: If the values provided by the user are deemed invalid then \\\"goal complete\\\" is set to \\\"No\\\". \\nRule3: If the user makes an unrelated request or refers to a completely different topic or task, \\\"within goal\\\" is set to \\\"No\\\". \\nRule4: If the user response can be answered by the AI system within the context of current conversation or goal, \\\"within goal\\\" is set to \\\"Yes\\\".\\n\\nGuidelines for Enterprise AI system:\\n1. Do not generate responses or values on your own. Please do not provide responses to user requests based solely on your own knowledge.\\n2.

I (22M) was planning a party with a group of my friends/coworkers for new years. We all pitched in to buy a hotel for the night and planned to go bar hopping. I came down with Covid a few days before and decided it would be best if I didn\\u2019t go. My wife decided to still go since we already paid money and she wasn\\u2019t around me much while I was sick. That night she got drunk and took mushrooms with my friend. After everyone came back to the room and was already hammered they turned out the lights and went to bed. She then had sex with my friend that she took the mushrooms with. All my friends knew about it and agreed the next morning that it would be the best idea not to tell me. From there a month goes by and I am none the wiser. My wife grows a little more distant and starts sleeping in a different room in our house. She starts becoming addicted to a game called wizard101 and joins a group chat on Discord with a bunch of people. One night about a week ago I walk by her room as I\\u2019m getting ready to go to bed and I hear a video playing. I walk in to turn it off and discover she is on FaceTime with another dude and they both fell asleep. I had a bad feeling about that so I go through her phone and I discover she had been flirting with him for a couple days and talking dirty to eachother. I confront her and she is very dismissive at first but she tries to make things better and I forgive her. After that though my trust with her broke a little bit. I checked her phone again two days later and found out she broke it off with the one dude and started flirting with another. I confront her again and we seem to make things work out. My trust broke a little more and I told her I wanted to go through her phone more often. She warned me not to go through her messages with one of her girl friends because they talks about me and she wants that privacy. I agree but after a couple more days(now this evening), my curiousity get the best of me and I discover that in her texts with her friend she had sex with someone and she says his name in there(my coworker). I decide to give him a call away from my wife and he tells me everything. He tells me how they were drunk/high and they had sex. He tells me that everyone there that night knows and decided it was best not to tell me. So I just confronted my wife about it and she tells me the truth and apologized saying it was a mistake. She wants to work on things but with all the factors considered I don\\u2019t know if our marriage is savable.\\n\\nTL;DR; How can I trust my friends or even my wife anymore? Any advice? Also I left out some parts due to personal reasons about why ending my marriage is almost an impossible thing for me to do but if I absolutely feel that I have to I may.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

LUXURIOUS PRIVATE CLINIC LOBBY - DAY\\n\\nThe spacious lobby of the clinic is adorned with minimalist furniture and modern art. The sound of a bubbling water feature adds a calming ambiance. In whirl Rosalinda Merrick and Verbena Lanford. They're both dressed to impress, wearing tight-fitting clothes and designer handbags slung over their shoulders.\\n\\nAs they strut across the polished marble floors, they catch the eyes of everyone around: doctors, patients, and even the giant fish swimming lazily in an oversized aquarium. The women chuckle and nudge each other, masking their bubbling nervousness with a fa\\u00e7ade of nonchalance. They exchange a competitive glance, each eager to see who will back down first.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. RECEPTION AREA\\n\\nRosalinda and Verbena flash their brightest smiles at the receptionist, who looks up from her computer screen with a hint of surprise.\\n\\nRECEPTIONIST\\n(smiling)\\nHow can I assist you today?\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(leaning in)\\nWe're here for the medical trials. We're participants.\\n\\nROSALINDA\\n(smirking)\\nThat's right. We're ready for whatever you've got.\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(grinning)\\nBring it on, I say. They can't be more thrilling than our last skydiving competition.\\n\\nRECEPTIONIST\\n(nodding)\\nOf course. If you could just fill out these forms, please? (hands them each a clipboard with a stack of papers)\\n\\nRosalinda and Verbena take the clipboards and begin to scan the documents, their brows furrowed in concentration. They exchange a few whispers and giggles, clearly not taking the whole thing too seriously. The hinted promise of danger from their adventure bubbles beneath their playful banter.\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(to Rosalinda)\\nI bet you'll be the first to cry uncle when they bring out the big needles.\\n\\nROSALINDA\\n(grinning)\\nPlease, you'll faint at the sight of a cotton swab!\\n\\nVERBENA\\nWe'll see.\\n\\nAfter they finish filling out the forms, they hand them back to the receptionist, who checks them over before stamping their papers with a flourish.\\n\\nRECEPTIONIST\\n(smiling)\\nGreat! Nurse Vipari will show you to your room.\\n\\nLuciana Vipari, a young nurse with a dazzling smile and a quick wit, appears from a side door and greets them warmly.\\n\\nNURSE LUCIANA VIPARI\\n(charming, effervescent)\\nWelcome to our clinic, Miss Merrick and Miss Lanford. I'm Luciana, and I'll be looking after you during your stay. If you're ready, I'll show you to your room.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. CLINIC HALLWAY - DAY\\n\\nLuciana Vipari, the clinic's beautiful, talkative nurse, leads them down the immaculately clean hallway, her heels clicking rhythmically.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. SHARED HOSPITAL ROOM\\n\\nLUCIANA\\nHere we are. You have some time to settle in before the preliminary exams.\\n\\nThe room is surprisingly cozy; with window looking out to a serene garden.\\n\\nLUCIANA\\nYour room comes equipped with adjustable beds for your comfort. The oxygen equipment is just in case you need it during a hyperventilation episode. And we've got some other medical tools, should they be required.\\n\\nROSALINDA\\n(whispering)\\nDo you think this is all just for show, or are they really going to push us to the limit?\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(whispering back)\\nAt least we'll be pampered in our own little deathtrap. Let's not worry about that now. We're here for the thrill, remember?\\n\\nRosalinda and Verbena are visibly impressed, but their smiles waver ever so slightly as they contemplate what necessitates these precautions.\\n\\nLuciana hands out the hospital gowns with an understanding smile, and then presents them with the adult diapers. Rosalinda raises an eyebrow while Verbena snorts in disbelief.\\n\\nROSALINDA\\n(turning the diaper over in her hands)\\nAre...are these really necessary?\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(laughing, trying to hide her own discomfort)\\nThis just got real, didn't it?\\n\\nLUCIANA\\nOh, not at all. It's just a precaution, as some treatments have... interesting side effects. You're not required to wear them, but I'd recommend it.\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(trying to joke)\\nWhat, in case we get scared stiff?\\n\\nROSALINDA\\n(chuckling)\\nFor when the experiments get a little too exciting.\\n\\nLuciana offers an enigmatic smile and excuses herself, leaving the two women alone with their apprehensions and the diapers. As the seriousness of their decision sinks in, they exchange a look that blends fear with thrill.\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(teasing)\\nStill think you're not going to cry uncle?\\n\\nROSALINDA\\n(tossing a diaper at Verbena)\\nOnly after you, my dear.\\n\\nThey erupt into laughter, shaking off the unease. They begin to change into the gowns, tossing clothes and quips back and forth. Then they eye the diapers, each daring the other to put one on first.\\n\\nVERBENA\\n(playfully)\\nWell, if it comes down to it, at least we'll be the best-looking patients in diapers.\\n\\nROSALINDA\\n(laughing)\\nSpeak for yourself.\\n\\nTheir laughter fills the room as they embrace the absurdity of the situation.\\n\\nFADE OUT.\\\"\\nWhat do you think about this scene and characters?\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}
