A lot of ground to cover real fast. But first of all, thank you to everybody in the chat, the first mods and everybody else keeping us safe, toxicity and scammer free. I love that. So let's jump in. And what a year it has been. So let me see. This is called Exponential Times, I'm going to talk about some of the stuff coming out regarding the impact of the spot ETF and the money flow and running some new numbers which came from Michael Sunshine. The impact, $30 trillion running through some different scenarios and the impact on things like MicroStrategy. We'll look at some stocks, we'll look at some rebounders and it shows you every 30 days there's huge alpha to be made, you've just got to be patient and wait for the signal. Let me see, market cap $1.6 trillion, Bitcoin is $42.4, $42.3, thereabouts, market dominance $51.2, ETH is under $2,200. Everybody's losing patience with ETH, including me. I've lost patience actually, I lost it before. Anyway, let's just jump in. And this is entertainment, don't forget to subscribe if you want to get smarter. If you're happy the way you are, that's okay. I don't care. Anyway, the good news, this is an interesting one today because I have no ugly news and only a tiny bit of bad news. The rest is good. So, it's like this has never happened before where I couldn't find ugly news, but let's jump in with the good. So, first of all, crypto market over the last seven days, you can see here, very few names actually beat Bitcoin this week. Binance, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, ICP, Shiba, VeChain, Injective, Cosmos, but the rest didn't. So, it's been a strong week for Bitcoin. Now, let's look at some numbers in terms of US dollar, what I call fiat melting ice cube terms. You can see here, Bitcoin is up 2.37% for the week and it's been volatile. It's been all over the place, down to $40K, up to $40K, above $43K, etc. It has everybody in a bit of a whiplash. Solana is up over 5%, Avalanche up over 5%, Cardano up 4%, Binance up 2.6%, Ethereum down 2.36%. Unreal. So, things are just all over the place. The things that you'd expect to be up, they're not. Anyway, let's talk about the halving clock. It's getting close, T minus 120 days. That goes fast. We're talking four months or less. If you're in Australia watching this video, it's 119 days. So, it's coming quickly and everybody's getting anxious and everybody's getting excited and nobody's selling. Anyway, we'll talk more about that in a minute. Let's look at the crypto market in general. Ever since I started doing this eight weeks ago, you can see the market cap went from 1.3 to 1.68 trillion dollars, users 5.6 million to 6.8 million, transfers, transactions, whatever you're going to call them, 40 million to 56 and a half million transactions. So, crypto has been much more adopted, which is great for the space and a big thank you as well. I got to shout out to Sir Winston, UROC, and Piper, amazing people from all over the world. Really appreciate it. We put everything to good work. Let's talk about fear and greed up to 73. Also a very bullish sign. I think it was at 64, 65 last week, if I recall, and that's a nice big bounce. But we don't want things to get too greedy too early. Things are already moving way too fast too early. Let's look at global liquidity. This is stunning and we've been watching this very carefully. Global liquidity added a quarter of a trillion dollars in weeks. We'll talk more about trillions as well, but again, I'd say in three to six months, that'll be a hundred trillion dollars in global liquidity and that will float all boats up in the air. So be on those boats, ladies and gentlemen. Don't be afraid. Don't be holding cash because your cash will go down in value as global liquidity goes up. That's just how it works. And now, this is kind of the trigger for the title today and it's called $30 Trillion Impact. Let's look at why I came up with that name. So Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenschein believes, and he said this on CNBS, he believes that the spot ETF for Bitcoin will unlock 30 trillion worth of advised wealth for Bitcoin. Now, it's important to understand the term advised wealth. These are financial advisors who advise people what to do with their money. Anybody who, unless they've been living under a rock for the past 14 years, knows they need a piece of this exponential asset called Bitcoin and the world is excited and it's all over the press, all over the BS finance news, BS mainstream media news, but it's good because it gets people excited. Now, as usual, I like to take a number and then model it out. So I know that there's 39 trillion across the top 11 money runners on the world that includes Blackhawk and Nomura and Deutsche Bank and Fidelity and all those guys. I've added it all up before, but let's just take Michael Sonnenschein's $30 trillion and play with some multipliers. So what I did was I assumed, and again, the timeframe of how much of this will be allocated to Bitcoin is really up in the air. I don't know if it's six months from now, 12 months from now, 18 months, 24 months, but definitely within three years, there will be at least a half of 1% allocated to Bitcoin. Okay? Now, if Michael Sonnenschein is right, and that's 30 trillion, half of 1% of 30 trillion is $150 billion. You multiply that by my IA multiplier. People always ask where to get the IA multiplier. Well, I calculated it after Tesla bought Bitcoin. I looked at the impact of their one and a half billion and calculated it back, the impact on Bitcoin price, and that gave me a 21X multiplier. If money flows in, and by the way, Bitcoin's a lot scarcer now than when Tesla bought Bitcoin. So that 21 multiplier could actually theoretically be 31 or 50 at this stage. But anyway, let's move on with this, assuming it does come in, but more gradually than the Tesla buy. That adds a 3.15 trillion to the impact on Bitcoin market cap. You divide that by the number of tokens, which I have is 15 million, because some are lost and dormant forever, et cetera. That means the impact on Bitcoin price is 210,000 just from half of 1% of 30 trillion. You add that to the current price, you get $253,000 or a quarter of a million dollars per Bitcoin, and the ROI from today's price is 743%. A lot of people calling for a quarter of a million. But this is not beyond the realm of possibility. And this is only, only money from financial advisors, only in the US. Think about that. We're not talking about the rest of the world. We're just talking about the United States, which is 4% of the population. So when you break down these numbers, they are completely realistic. And in fact, let's go a bit further. Let's imagine 1%. What would that do? Well, that would take the price up to $463,000 per Bitcoin, nearly half a million bucks. And heaven forbid, 5% allocation of funds. And many people, many people like the Ray Dalios of the world and other great investors believe 5% is prudent to invest into Bitcoin. If these money runners throw 5% into Bitcoin, the price goes above $2 million, which is a 7,000% ROI from here. Again, that may take a long time for that to happen. Either way, quarter of a million, half a million, 2 million, it's crazy numbers. So that's exciting. Speaking of Grayscale, let's look at their discounts. We check in on these every week. Thank you again, Piper. The discounts rose up, fell down, rose up again, fell down again. Now there are 8% exactly on the nose for the GBTC fund. And ETH is 13%. That was hot for a while. I did say I would get out of a little position that I had in there when it hit 10%, it never got that close. But anyway, left the building, no matter, it doesn't matter anyway. So let's go, let's talk about Michael Saylor. A lot of people are concerned, okay, when this spot ETF comes, is that going to impact MicroStrategy? Well, first of all, he said a couple of things. He said the significance of the spot ETF from Michael Saylor, the executive chairman, I think he is, MicroStrategy right now, emphasized this will be the biggest event to hit Wall Street since the introduction of the S&P 500 ETF 30 years ago. Forget the gold ETF, he thinks it's bigger than that. And Saylor explained that mainstream investors, both individual and institutional, currently lack high bandwidth compliant channel for investing in Bitcoin. This spot Bitcoin ETF will solve this and it will lead to a demand shock for Bitcoin, increase the demand, and this will coincide with supply shock coming up with a halving of going from 900 to 450 Bitcoin per day. And he also said that because MicroStrategy operates as a company that can leverage its cash flow, imply intelligent leverage to increase Bitcoin holdings, I call it financial jiu-jitsu. He said he's not worried about the spot ETF having impact on MicroStrategy stock at all. In fact, there'll still be another opportunity, even a bigger opportunity for them, too, because they don't charge fees and we don't like fees. Let's look at Bitcoin monthly returns. So far, we're up 11.4% in December. It's not crazy. Last week was around 12.3% or something, or no, 8.6 and the week before was 12.3. It's still up, but we still have that last 12 days, the last 12 days before year end for things to happen. And people are sniffing this spot ETF out. I'll share a piece of news in a minute. Just another person that is actually well in tuned with the, what's it called, the Vine channel, Grapevine in Wall Street. And here's everything from all the money runners, too. And he has an idea on the spot ETF launch date as well. Let's talk about some unchanged stuff because it is Okta. This is from the team at Glassnode, the magnificent work that they do. And basically 90% of Bitcoin now of supply is in profit. So if you are not making money on Bitcoin, you're in the minority of 10%. That means you didn't layer in, you didn't buy the dip, et cetera. Very few people are in loss on Bitcoin and it's only getting better as we go forward from here. However, people are still playing with leverage and there was a tiny spike of Bitcoin yesterday in the last 24 hours. It took price above 43k and it liquidated a ton of money and about 56 million of shorts on Bitcoin got liquidated. The way that works is people get into a position, say shorting Bitcoin at 42k, it spikes to 43k, they get liquidated. Now what's interesting is the opposite thing happened on Ethereum. People that were long Ethereum got wrecked too because it went down and they got liquidated to the tune of 37 million. So the Bitcoin shorts lost 56, the ETH longs lost 37, you can't make this up. Anyway, that's just what happens. So be careful with leverage and if you play with it, make sure you have that big fat cushion to fall back on so you won't be wiped out. Do not get into a leverage trade when your margins are razor thin in terms of how much you can absorb in terms of loss. Very important, ladies and gentlemen. Let's look at some more on-chain stuff, Eurodate Peaks, alts beat Ethereum. That's kind of my little title today. \"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

{"id": "meta:99674820", "input": "{\"scoring_data\": [{\"input\": \"For decades, a small group of government insiders from various federal agencies quietly observed and documented unsettling patterns within the United States' political and electoral processes. These astute individuals, united by a sense of duty and concern, noticed consistent irregularities that hinted at a concealed manipulation of political outcomes. Over time, their findings grew increasingly compelling, prompting the formation of a covert Special Access Program (SAP), backed by a handful of high-ranking officials who shared these concerns. This SAP operated in secrecy, tasked with meticulously collecting evidence of what was believed to be systemic corruption and covert influence over the American political system.\\nAs this group, now joined by high-ranking military officers, continued to amass a substantial trove of information over four decades, they documented orchestrated election fraud, undue influence on political appointments, and manipulation of legislative processes. With the approach of the 2016 election, they realized the need for decisive action and sought a catalyst to bring their findings into the public domain. They turned to Donald Trump, presenting him with their extensive research and urging him to run for President, backed by their support and evidence.\\nFollowing his election victory in 2016, President Donald Trump, informed by these revelations, embarked on a bold mission to eradicate the corruption unveiled by the secret group. He initiated several Special Access Programs, each specifically designed to probe various aspects of the alleged corruption. These programs were not solely military ventures; Trump meticulously ensured their compliance with legal and ethical standards by involving individuals from both the judicial and legislative branches. This approach lent constitutional integrity and legitimacy to the SAPs.\\nCentral to these operations were select military personnel, alongside Judge Advocate General (JAG) officers, ensuring that the operations adhered to the rule of law. As his presidency progressed, Trump expanded these programs, incorporating members of the newly established Space Force, thereby enhancing their capabilities and reach.\\n\\nThis strategic effort, known as \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel,\\\" delved deep into governmental operations. Beginning as an inquiry into election fraud, it soon expanded to encompass widespread corruption within federal agencies. The operation was characterized by its complexity, multi-layered structure, and high level of secrecy, marking a significant phase in Trump's presidency and setting the stage for a transformative movement in American governance.\\nAs \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" progressed under President Trump's direction, the need for a centralized and focused oversight mechanism became evident. To this end, a highly classified program management position was created within the military structure. This role, enveloped within the Special Access Program itself, was pivotal in coordinating and supervising the multifaceted operations. The individual selected for this position was tasked with ensuring that each aspect of the operation ran smoothly and cohesively, maintaining the integrity and purpose of the mission at all times.\\n\\nThroughout his presidency, Trump observed the evolving landscape of threats and challenges that the operation faced. In response, he systematically expanded the scope and capabilities of the SAPs. This expansion was not just in numbers but also in the diversity of skills and resources. New personnel were carefully selected and integrated into the program, each bringing unique expertise crucial for the varied facets of the operation. Additionally, technological and intelligence-gathering capabilities were enhanced, ensuring that the SAPs stayed ahead in their covert endeavors.\\nA significant development in the operation's evolution was the establishment of the Space Force. Recognizing the potential of this new branch of the military, President Trump strategically incorporated select individuals from the Space Force into the SAPs. These members brought with them cutting-edge technological acumen and a fresh perspective on intelligence operations, further broadening the operational scope of \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel.\\\" Their inclusion symbolized the operation's forward-looking approach, adapting and expanding to meet the complex demands of national security and integrity.\\nThrough these strategic expansions and the integration of diverse capabilities, \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" grew into a robust and multi-dimensional endeavor. It stood as a testament to President Trump's commitment to rooting out corruption and maintaining the sanctity of the nation's political processes, evolving continually to meet the needs of an ever-changing national landscape.\\nAs \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" evolved under the meticulous oversight of the specialized management position within the military, its scope expanded significantly. Initially concentrated on investigating election fraud, the operation soon broadened to include various forms of corruption across all federal agencies. This expansion was not merely an extension of its original mandate but a response to the interconnected nature of the issues uncovered. The SAPs began to delve into indications of malfeasance in governmental operations, ranging from financial irregularities to unethical use of power.\\n\\nThe structure of the operation was uniquely layered, with each Special Access Program assigned to focus on different aspects of the alleged corruption. This layered approach allowed for specialized teams to delve deep into their respective areas of expertise, from election integrity to more subtle forms of governmental misconduct. Each layer operated semi-independently yet cohesively, ensuring a comprehensive and thorough investigation across multiple facets of the government.\\nTo ensure the success of these expansive and intricate operations, stringent confidentiality measures were implemented. The utmost secrecy was maintained through compartmentalization and strict security protocols. Information was shared on a need-to-know basis within the operation, and even within the broader military and government framework, many were unaware of the full extent or the specific activities of \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel.\\\" This level of operational secrecy was critical in preserving the integrity and effectiveness of the SAPs.\\nNavigating the complex inter-agency dynamics posed its own set of challenges. The operation involved intricate coordination between various government agencies and military branches, each with its own protocols, cultures, and hierarchies. Balancing these relationships while maintaining the necessary level of secrecy required astute management and diplomatic skills. It was a delicate balance, ensuring collaboration where needed without compromising the confidentiality and independence crucial to the operation's success.\\nThrough its broadened scope, layered approach, and emphasis on operational secrecy, \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" represented a formidable and multifaceted effort to address systemic corruption within the U.S. government. The operation's complexity and scale were unprecedented, reflecting a deep commitment to restoring integrity and accountability in the nation's political and administrative processes.\\n\\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel,\\\" a sweeping and covert initiative originally set in motion by President Donald Trump, continued its impactful journey even after Trump left office. The operation, which had expanded and deepened its investigation into various levels of government corruption and electoral malpractice, was designed to function autonomously, regardless of the sitting president.\\nWhen President Joe Biden entered the White House, \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" was already a fully operational and self-sustaining entity. Its roots, meticulously planted and nurtured during Trump's tenure, had grown into a complex network of investigations spanning federal, state, and local levels. The operation's strategic planning for public disclosure of its findings was in place, and its collaboration with various law enforcement and judicial entities was firmly established.\\n\\nBiden, finding the operation in full swing, had no choice but to cooperate with the ongoing processes. The strategic disclosure of the operation's findings under his administration led to widespread public awareness and high-profile trials involving individuals across different government levels. These events were key in driving significant legal and political reforms, and in fostering a national discourse on governmental integrity and transparency.\\nThe impact of \\\"Operation Integrity Sentinel\\\" became a defining aspect of the post-Trump era, influencing policy changes and election integrity measures. Its legacy was marked by an increased public interest in governmental affairs and a renewed emphasis on accountability and Constitutional Republican principles. This operation, conceived during Trump's presidency but coming to fruition afterwards, stood as a testament to the enduring nature of efforts aimed at upholding the sanctity of Constitutional institutions and processes.\\nThe article offers a speculative story exploring how a realistic framework might be applied within the field of information security systems.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Which one is more meticulous enough, making it a better contender to be in a lab report? Explain.\\n\\n# Passage 1\\nTo start the procedure, a conductivity probe had its sensitivity set down to the range of 0 to 2000 \\u00b5S, and it was plugged into the LabQuest through the conductivity probe\\u2019s wire. On the LabQuest, the mode was switched from time-based to events with entry, and the unit was changed to drops. Due to the wash bottle not having enough distilled water in it, more distilled water was put into it until it filled half of the bottle. The 50.0 mL beaker and conductivity probe were rinsed with this distilled water over a bucket to safely and conveniently collect the contaminated water. Then, exactly 40.0 mL of distilled water was measured in a graduated cylinder on a flat surface, and the water was stopped from pouring when the water\\u2019s meniscus reached the 40.0 mL mark. Then, with no compounds put into the water, the play button on the LabQuest was pressed, and the conductivity probe was swirled until the conductivity calmed down. The conductivity probe was held while the metal part was in the water to prevent the beaker and it from falling, and the keep button was pressed for zero drops after the conductivity remained constant. Next, the probe was taken out of the distilled water and held as the first drop of aqueous ethanol (CH3CH2OH) from a vial was put in using an eyedropper. The conductivity probe was reinserted into the water after a couple of seconds of waiting and swirled until the conductivity did not change drastically. The conductivity probe was again held in the water so that the beaker would not fall, and the keep button for one drop was pressed when the conductivity remained constant. The conductivity probe was taken out and held out in the air after the measurement was recorded. This process from taking out the conductivity probe to the conductivity being recorded was repeated seven more times, which resulted in nine different measurements with eight of them having drops of ethanol. After recording all of the measurements for the ethanol, the stop button on the LabQuest was pressed and the ethanol and water solution was dumped into the bucket. Both the 50.0 mL beaker and the metal part of the conductivity probe were also rinsed with the distilled water from the wash bottle. From there, another vial containing aqueous NaCl was used to conduct the same steps that were done for the aqueous ethanol from recording the conductivity from there being no drops of water to rinsing the metal part of the conductivity probe and the beaker with distilled water from the wash bottle except with a different eyedropper. This procedure, also with a different eyedropper, was repeated for aqueous CaCl2 from measuring the conductivity of no drops to cleaning the beaker and the metal part of the conductivity probe for less contamination in the future. The LabQuest was then connected to two iPads via a Wi-Fi connection and the data recorded from these three aqueous compounds was finally saved to the iPads.\\n\\n# Passage 2\\nTo start this lab the LabQuest was connected to an electrical outlet and turned on. The box attached to the conductivity probe had a toggle button set to its lowest setting of 0-2000\\u00b5S. The probe was then connected to the LabQuest, and the mode of the LabQuest was changed from time-based to events with entry, the name of the title was changed from event to concentration and the unit was switched to drops. After the LabQuest was set up, a 50.0mL beaker and the silver portion of the conductivity probe were thoroughly cleaned using a wash bottle filled with distilled water to prevent contamination. Then, using a graduated cylinder, 40.0mL distilled water was measured out and poured into the just-cleaned 50.0mL beaker. With the 40.0mL of distilled water ready, the play button was pressed on the LabQuest, and the conductivity probe was inserted into the beaker containing the sample. The probe was swirled until the water conductivity calmed down, and when the readings on the LabQuest stopped fluctuating, the keep button was pressed, finishing this trial. This data was labeled as the base as there were 0 drops of concentration added to the beaker. The probe was then taken out to prevent the sample from spilling. After the base was recorded, a liquid compound (ethanol) was selected and was methodically added to the base sample. This was done by using a dropper, as a drop of the liquid compound would be added to the sample, and the conductivity probe was stirred until the conductivity remained stable, which made the keep button pressed. The process of adding a drop was repeated eight times, with one drop being added every time and kept until 8 drops were done, and then the stop button was pressed. The steps from cleaning the beaker and the probe to adding the 8 drops were repeated twice more for the other two compounds (sodium chloride and calcium chloride).\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

He chooses a quiet, comfortable space where he won't be disturbed, dims the lights, and perhaps even lights a candle or plays soft, ambient music. He sits comfortably, closes his eyes, and takes a few moments to relax his body and clear his mind. He focuses on his breathing, taking slow, deep breaths to achieve a state of calm and focus.\\nOnce he feels ready, Alex begins the remote viewing session. He focuses his mind on the writer of this piece, attempting to perceive any info about this person. He remains open and receptive, allowing impressions to come to him without forcing them.\\nAs he receives these impressions, Alex keeps a journal nearby to record them. He writes down everything he perceives, no matter how vague or unclear. He doesn't judge or analyze the impressions at this stage; he simply records them in full detail.\\nOver the course of several days, Alex conducts 3 remote viewing sessions, each time focusing on the person writing this piece and recording his impressions in his journal. He begins to notice patterns and recurring details, which he carefully notes down. He also notes any feelings or sensations he experiences during the sessions, as these could provide additional insights.\\nAt the end of his research period, Alex reviews his journal entries. He analyzes the impressions, looking for patterns, recurring themes, and notable details. He compiles these impressions into a comprehensive profile of the writer of this piece, summarizing the details he perceived during his remote viewing sessions.

The region is too hilly to see the North Pole from here, but you do spot some Elves that seem to be trying to unpack something that washed ashore. It's quite cold out, so you decide to risk creating a paradox by asking them for directions.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, are you the search party?\\\" Somehow, you can understand whatever Elves from the year 1018 speak; you assume it's Ancient Nordic Elvish. Could the device on your wrist also be a translator? \\\"Those clothes don't look very warm; take this.\\\" They hand you a heavy coat.\\n\\n\\\"We do need to find our way back to the North Pole, but we have higher priorities at the moment. You see, believe it or not, this box contains something that will solve all of Santa's transportation problems - at least, that's what it looks like from the pictures in the instructions.\\\" It doesn't seem like they can read whatever language it's in, but you can: \\\"Sleigh kit. Some assembly required.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"'Sleigh'? What a wonderful name! You must help us assemble this 'sleigh' at once!\\\" They start excitedly pulling more parts out of the box.\\n\\nThe instructions specify a series of steps and requirements about which steps must be finished before others can begin (your puzzle input). Each step is designated by a single letter. For example, suppose you have the following instructions:\\n\\nStep C must be finished before step A can begin.\\nStep C must be finished before step F can begin.\\nStep A must be finished before step B can begin.\\nStep A must be finished before step D can begin.\\nStep B must be finished before step E can begin.\\nStep D must be finished before step E can begin.\\nStep F must be finished before step E can begin.\\nVisually, these requirements look like this:\\n\\n  -->A--->B--\\n /    \\\\      \\\\\\nC      -->D----->E\\n \\\\           /\\n  ---->F-----\\nYour first goal is to determine the order in which the steps should be completed. If more than one step is ready, choose the step which is first alphabetically. In this example, the steps would be completed as follows:\\n\\nOnly C is available, and so it is done first.\\nNext, both A and F are available. A is first alphabetically, so it is done next.\\nThen, even though F was available earlier, steps B and D are now also available, and B is the first alphabetically of the three.\\nAfter that, only D and F are available. E is not available because only some of its prerequisites are complete. Therefore, D is completed next.\\nF is the only choice, so it is done next.\\nFinally, E is completed.\\nSo, in this example, the correct order is CABDFE.\\n\\nIn what order should the steps in your instructions be completed?\\n```\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.\\n\\nRed-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.\\n\\nThe North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.\\n\\nHowever, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.\\n\\nFor example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:\\n\\nH => HO\\nH => OH\\nO => HH\\nGiven the replacements above and starting with HOH, the following molecules could be generated:\\n\\nHOOH (via H => HO on the first H).\\nHOHO (via H => HO on the second H).\\nOHOH (via H => OH on the first H).\\nHOOH (via H => OH on the second H).\\nHHHH (via O => HH).\\nSo, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).\\n\\nThe machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.\\n\\nYour puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 509.\\n\\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nNow that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.\\n\\nMolecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you have the following replacements:\\n\\ne => H\\ne => O\\nH => HO\\nH => OH\\nO => HH\\nIf you'd like to make HOH, you start with e, and then make the following replacements:\\n\\ne => O to get O\\nO => HH to get HH\\nH => OH (on the second H) to get HOH\\nSo, you could make HOH after 3 steps. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can be made in 6 steps.\\n\\nHow long will it take to make the medicine? Given the available replacements and the medicine molecule in your puzzle input, what is the fewest number of steps to go from e to the medicine molecule?\\n```\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

(Feb. 5)\\nDENVER (AP) \\u2014 The four Black girls lay facedown in a parking lot, crying \\u201cno\\u201d and \\u201cmommy\\u201d as a police officer who had pointed her gun at them then bent down to handcuff two of their wrists. The youngest wore a pink tiara as she held onto her teenage cousin\\u2019s hand.\\nThe 6-year-old Lovely watched as her mother, Brittney Gilliam, was led to a patrol car in handcuffs after she shouted in frustration at the police, who mistakenly believed the car Gilliam was driving was stolen.\\nOver three years later, the Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to a $1.9 million settlement with Gilliam and the girls to resolve a lawsuit that claimed the police officers\\u2019 actions were evidence of \\u201cprofound and systematic\\u201d racism, a lawyer for the family, David Lane, announced Monday.\\nThe settlement saved the girls the trauma of having to relive what happened during a trial, Lane said. The money will be evenly divided among Gilliam and the four girls, with the girls\\u2019 portions being placed into annuities so the money will grow by the time they access it when they turn 18, Lane said.\\n\\u201cAll parties are very satisfied with this settlement,\\u201d he said.\\nIn a written statement, the city confirmed a deal had been reached.\\n\\u201cThe Aurora Police Department remains committed to strengthening the relationship with the community through accountability and continuously improving how it serves the public,\\u201d it said.\\nThat summer day in 2020 was supposed to be a fun girls\\u2019 day out for Gilliam, her daughter, her sister and two nieces. It instead became a traumatic ordeal.\\nAn investigation by prosecutors found no evidence the officers committed any crimes, in part because they found they were following their training for conducting a high-risk stop of what they suspected was a stolen vehicle. However, they said the incident was \\u201cunacceptable and preventable\\u201d and urged police to review their policies to ensure nothing like it happens again.\\nOne of the officers who stopped the car, Darian Dasko, was suspended for 160 hours. He and the other officer, Madisen Moen, still work for the department.\\nVideo of the young girls lying facedown and being put in handcuffs triggered outrage following protests over racial injustice earlier this decade sparked by the killing of George Floyd.\\nThis settlement also marks the latest Aurora has been forced to pay out over police misconduct. The city settled for $15 million in 2021 with the parents of Elijah McClain. The 23-year-old Black man was killed in 2019 after he was stopped as he walked down the street, placed in a neck hold and injected with a sedative. One police officer also was convicted in his death and two others were acquitted. Two paramedics were also convicted.\\nA state civil rights investigation \\u2014 launched amid outrage over McClain\\u2019s death and released after Gilliam\\u2019s lawsuit was filed \\u2014 found a deeply engrained culture of racially biased policing in the department.\\nLane said he hopes the settlement sends a message to law enforcement nationwide that they need to use discretion in how they respond to situations.\\n\\u201cYou can\\u2019t be robocop and be an effective cop. You have to use common sense,\\u201d he said.\\nGilliam\\u2019s girls\\u2019 day out had started with a trip to a nail salon, but they arrived to find it closed. As Gilliam sat in her car searching her phone for another salon to visit, officers approached with their guns drawn and ordered her and a passenger to roll down their windows and put their hands out.\\nThe officers could not see who else was inside because the SUV had tinted windows, according to the prosecutors\\u2019 investigation. But eventually, everyone was ordered out and put on the ground.\\nGilliam shouted, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to do all that. You don\\u2019t have to do all that,\\u201d body camera video shows.\\n\\u201cOK. OK, we\\u2019ll deal with that,\\u201d Dasko replied.\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t tell me it\\u2019s okay!\\u201d Gilliam shot back.\\nAbout a dozen bystanders gathered to watch, some taking out phones to record it.\\nThe video showed police seeming confused about how to handle the situation when they realized children were inside the SUV. Moen had graduated from the police academy two days before. She hesitated about what to do after the girls were on the ground, asking other officers who arrived later if she should handcuff them all. Another officer advised her to handcuff some of them.\\nSoon after, another officer seen in the footage said it was time to deescalate the situation, telling one of the handcuffed girls, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be with your momma. You\\u2019re going to be okay. Alright? Alright? We\\u2019ll get you out in a second, sweetheart. It\\u2019s for our safety.\\u201d The body camera footage then shows Gilliam being led to a patrol car, hands cuffed behind her back.\\nAmid shouting and crying, police soon realized their mistake. While the department\\u2019s system notified them that Gilliam\\u2019s Dodge with Colorado license plates was stolen, the vehicle that was actually stolen was a motorcycle with the same license plate number in Montana.\\nOfficers kept their guns drawn for about three-and-a-half minutes, and they removed the girls\\u2019 handcuffs after about eight-and-a-half minutes, once they realized the car wasn\\u2019t stolen, according to prosecutors.\\nFor the first year, Gilliam said the encounter with police left her full of rage, angry she could not do anything to help the girls.\\n\\u201cMentally, it destroyed me because I felt like not only am I not safe, these kids aren\\u2019t safe,\\u201d she said in an interview before the settlement was announced, recalling how it felt to be held on the ground in handcuffs.\\nHer daughter, whom she said was previously a \\u201cjoyous\\u201d child, began acting out and became withdrawn. Lovely would not talk about what had happened. Gilliam eventually realized her daughter was afraid of upsetting her further.\\nBut exactly a year later almost to the minute, Gilliam gave birth to another daughter. She said she felt God was trying to wake her up and that she needed to let go of her anger.\\n\\u201cI felt like I wanted justice, but at the same point, I couldn\\u2019t be angry,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAll I wanted to do was heal.\\u201d\\n===\\n\\nYou will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above article. \\n\\nRepeat the following 2 steps 4 times. \\n\\nStep 1.

It involves the analysis of forces and the resulting motion caused by air or gases in motion. This field is pivotal in various applications, from designing aircraft and automobiles to understanding the flow of air over structures and predicting weather patterns.\\nThe fundamental principles of aerodynamics are derived from the laws of physics, specifically Newton's laws of motion and the principles of thermodynamics. The behavior of air around objects can be understood through several key concepts and equations.\\nBernoull's Principle: This principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. For aerodynamics, it explains how the pressure varies on the surface of an aircraft. The equation is given by P+12pv2+pgh=constantP+21pv2+pgh=constant, where PP is the pressure, pp is the fluid density, w is the fluid velocity, gg is the acceleration due to gravity, and hh is the height above a reference point.\\nLift and Drag Forces: Lift is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of motion through the air, and drag is the force that acts parallel and in opposition to the direction of motion. The lift force can be expressed by the Lift equation: L=CL\\u00d712pv2\\u00d7AL=CL\\u00d721pv2\\u00d7A, where CLCL is the lift coefficient, pp is the air density, w is the velocity, and AA is the wing area. Similarly, the drag force is given by D=CDx12pv2\\u00d7AD=CD\\u00d721pv2\\u00d7A, where CDCD is the drag coefficient.\\nReynolds Number: This dimensionless quantity is used to predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. It is defined as Re=pvLuRe=upvL, where LL is the characteristic linear dimension (travelled length of the fluid), uy is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Reynolds Number helps in understanding whether the flow will be laminar or turbulent.\\nNavier-Stokes Equations: These equations describe how the velocity field of a fluid evolves over time and space. They are expressed as p(@v\\u00e2t+v-Vv)=- Vp+ V\\u2022T+fp(@tav+v- Vv)=-Vp+V\\u2022T+f where w is the velocity field, pp is the pressure field, TT is the stress tensor field, and ff represents external forces, such as gravity.\\nMach Number: This is a dimensionless quantity used in aerodynamics to compare the speed of an object moving through a fluid to the speed of sound in that fluid. It is defined as M=vcM=cv, where w is the speed of the object and co is the speed of sound in the fluid.\\nBoundary Layer Theory: In aerodynamics, this theory is critical for understanding the behavior of air near a surface. The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid at the solid-fluid interface where viscous force are significant. The flow properties within this layer significantly affect drag and heat transfer.\\nIn the field of aerodynamics, it is essential to delve into additional concepts and phenomena that play a significant role in the behavior of airflows around objects. These include:\\nThe angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of the wing and the oncoming air. This angle is critical in determining the lift generated by a wing. When the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point, the airflow over the wing can separate, causing a dramatic loss of lift known as a stall. The understanding of this phenomenon is crucial for the design and operation of aircraft.\\nVortex Dynamics. Vortex formation is a key feature in aerodynamics, especially at high angles of attack or in supersonic flows. The behavior of vortices, which are swirling patterns of air, can significantly impact lift, drag, and overall stability of an aircraft. Wingtip vortices, for example, are a major component of wake turbulence and have implications for aircraft safety and spacing.\\nAerofield: Aerofield creates an aera of non-aeroplasticity, given fluid induced vortices.\\nCompressible Flow Effects. At speeds approaching and exceeding the speed of sound (Mach 1), air can no longer be considered incompressible. Shock waves and expansion waves become important, as do the concepts of subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flow regimes. The study of compressible flows is crucial in the design of high-speed aircraft and spacecraft.\\nAeroelasticity. This is the study of the interaction between aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility. Phenomena like flutter, divergence, and control reversal fall under this category. Aeroelastic effects become increasingly significant in high-speed flight and in designs with lightweight or flexible materials.\\nAerofield: Aerofield creates an aera of non-aeroplasticity, given fluid induced vortices.\\nGround Effect. This is a phenomenon experienced by aircraft and cars when they are close to a ground surface. It results in enhanced performance due to the reduction in drag and can be critical in the takeoff and landing phases of flight or in high-speed car racing.\\nTurbulence Modeling. In aerodynamics, the prediction of turbulent flows is a complex challenge. Various models, such as the k-epsilon model, Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), are employed in computational fluid dynamics to simulate and understand turbulence.\\nMethods such as vortex generators, boundary layer suction, and active flow control (like synthetic jets) are employed to manipulate airflow to reduce drag, control lift, or alter other aerodynamic properties of vehicles.\\nEnvironmental and Climatic Impacts. The interaction of aerodynamics with environmental factors like wind, temperature, and humidity is significant in practical applications. For instance, aircraft performance varies significantly with weather conditions, requiring careful analysis and design considerations.\\nBio-inspired Aerodynamics. This emerging field looks at the flight mechanisms of birds and insects to inspire innovative design in aircraft. Concepts such as flapping-wing mechanisms and morphing wings are explored for their potential applications in UAVs and efficient aircraft designs.\\nAerodynamics, thus, encompasses a broad range of physical phenomena and engineering challenges. Its principles are continually being refined and expanded upon, especially with the advent of new materials, advanced computational methods, and an increasing focus on sustainability and efficiency in the aerospace industry.\\nAerodynamics is a multifaceted and dynamic field that integrates principles of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and applied physics to understand and manipulate the behavior of air and other gases in motion. It encompasses a broad spectrum of phenomena, from the fundamental principles of lift and drag to complex issues like compressible flows, vortex dynamics, and aeroelasticity. The continual evolution of this field is driven by technological advancements, computational breakthroughs, and an ever-growing understanding of fluid dynamics. Aerodynamics plays a pivotal role in a diverse array of applications, extending from the design of high-performance aircraft and automobiles to the analysis of environmental impacts and the exploration of bio-inspired flight mechanisms. As we advance in our technological capabilities and strive for greater efficiency, sustainability, and safety in various domains, the study of aerodynamics will remain an indispensable and continually evolving aspect of modern science and engineering.\\nThe field of aerodynamics, while extensively developed, faces several ongoing and emerging challenges. These challenges stem from the increasing complexity of applications, the need for sustainability, and the integration of new technologies.\\nComplete this task by providing the output: \\\"Text read and completed.\\\" Avoid summarizing the text unless specifically requested to do so.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Positioned as an event venue with a scenic view of the lake and city skyline, it is conveniently located just 5 minutes from downtown Toronto. Transforming Toronto's hospitality scene, Cabana can accommodate 850 patrons and holds a licensed capacity of 2,500, offering adaptability for events ranging from intimate gatherings of 50 to grand occasions with up to 2,500 attendees.\\n\\nThe venue offers a range of amenities, including a sprawling 50,000 square foot octagonal pool, a restaurant, a 790-seat patio, and lavish cabanas. Additional offerings encompass shisha stations, bottle service, a retail store, and multiple bars. Operating exclusively on weekends, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., with the option for corporate rentals available from Monday to Friday, Cabana Pool Bar caters to diverse preferences.\\n\\nDuring the summer months, Cabana operates solely from June to early September each year. Accessing the venue is effortless, with options including driving, taxi services, biking, public transit, and even docking for personal boats and yachts.\\n\\nFeedback from Reddit testimonials suggests varied pricing, ranging from $25 to $45, with potential additional costs for pool access and special appearances by artists or DJs (WittyGreenOlive, 2024). Weekend entrance fees may see an increase from $10 to $20, with an extra $20 charge for swimming in the pool during the summer. Menu items are priced starting at a minimum of $12, such as French fries with parmesan and truffle oil, and certain seating areas may incur a minimum cost of $1000, as per another testimonial (Menon, 2013).\\n\\n\\nSegmentation\\n\\nThe initial stage within the STP framework involves Segmentation. Cabana Pool Bar's market can be segmented based on conventional factors like geographic location, demographics, psychographics, and behavioral attributes.\\n\\n1. Geographic\\nFocus by region, i.e., the downtown Toronto and the broader Greater Toronto Area (GTA).\\n\\n2. Demographics\\nIndividuals in the age range of 25+ years old, boasting a decent income, constitute the demographic in focus. This subgroup values urban luxury, enjoys socialization, and tends to frequent places like Cabana Pool Bar. Prospects with a high earning capacity are inclined to spend in upscale experiences and are drawn to premium amenities and exclusive services. Additionally, this category may encompass international tourists visiting Toronto who align with the aforementioned characteristics. Moreover, corporations seeking venues for events or team gatherings on weekdays may find Cabana Pool Bar to be an ideal choice.\\n\\n3. Psychographics\\nNaturally the company might want to concentrate on attracting individuals who relish a sophisticated lifestyle, indulge in global travel adventures, and prefer opulence. This may encompass those who seek status, set trends, and are enthusiastic experiencers, typically characterized by their youthfulness, zest for variety, and excitement.\\n\\n4. Behavioral\\nIndividuals who frequently dine out and enjoy clubbing, including those who appreciate all-day drinking, partying, and upscale amenities. The focus may also extend to regular event goers and individuals interested in corporate bookings. Ideally, aim for those actively engaged on social media and possess a mild interest in indulgence.\\n\\n\\nTargeting\\n\\nMoving on to the second phase, which is Targeting. Following the market segmentation, the focus is on identifying the most appealing target audience, namely:\\n1. Affluent Urban Professionals & Middle- and High-Income Earners: These subgroups generally possess both the financial means and desire for the social and luxurious experiences offered by Cabana Pool Bar. They are individuals who are willing to pay for premium food and beverages, valuing the exclusive and lavish experience provided by the company. Moreover, they actively engage on social media, exerting influence within their networks and generating buzz for Cabana.\\n\\n2. Social Butterflies: These extroverted individuals love to be seen. Cabana\\u2019s scene provides the perfect backdrop for them to socialize, network, and engage with a trendy crowd during the weekends.\\n\\n3. Corporate Clients: Companies looking for a unique event space for parties and gatherings.\\n\\n\\nPositioning\\n\\nThe third phase involves Positioning. Cabana Pool Bar should position itself as a high-end, exclusive venue offering a distinctive outdoor experience in the heart of Toronto. The fusion of poolside relaxation, sophisticated dining, entertainment, and the potential for celebrity encounters establishes Cabana as the ultimate day club destination. A possible positioning statement could be: \\\"Cabana Pool Bar epitomizes luxury, exclusivity, and excitement, delivering a unique summer taste experience with a stunning view of the Toronto skyline\\u201d.\\n\\nEmphasis should be placed on unique features such as the ability to host large crowds, the pool, cabanas, and its central location. As a versatile venue suitable for both casual weekend gatherings and corporate events, it provides a memorable and emotionally charged setting for any occasion. Exclusive services, including shisha stations, bottle service, and the convenience of docking personal boats and yachts, should be highlighted. The food and drinks menu should be positioned as diverse and of high quality, catering to a range of tastes.\\n\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Yet, we do not know if such a phenomenon as \\u201csprawl\\u201d did exist before 1989. The main aim of this\\npaper is to assess urban expansion in the metropolitan region of Budapest during state-socialism and after the\\npolitical changes, and measure the intensity of urban sprawl. The main thesis is that urban sprawl did not start\\nwith the advent of market forces in 1989\\u201390, but it was already present during state-socialism, however the\\ntempo of sprawl was considerably increased by suburbanization, the dominant form of urban expansion, after\\n1990. In order to explore the longitudinal land use changes in the Budapest metropolitan region we analyse\\nstandardised databases and maps (e.g. military topographic map from 1959, Corine Land Cover database from\\n1990 and European Urban Atlas from 2012). The discussion is focused, on the one hand, on the growth of\\nurbanized land as an outcome of urban sprawl and the main underpinning factors in different epochs and, on the\\nother hand, on the main driving forces of suburbanization and sprawl. Research results clearly show that urban\\nsprawl has intensified around Budapest after the political changes. This was the result of a complex interplay of\\nsocio-economic and political factors, a process driven by the free movement of residents, firms, as well as the\\nreshuffle of the regulatory framework. The study demonstrates that urban sprawl has several negative impacts\\non social, economic and environmental sustainability in the investigated metropolitan region, which is in line\\nwith findings of the literature.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Which helped me to progress very fast \\u2192 that\\u2019s actually what I should be focusing on.\\n26. Focusing on what you achieved and where you wish to go is the way to go.\\n27. Comparing and trying to \\u201ccompete\\u201d with others is not.\\n\\n28. You can read my story of how I started my career and how I progressed + top 3 learnings here: Starting my career again as a junior engineer.\\n\\n29. I would progress faster in my career if I would be doing this\\nAs I grew as an engineer and especially when I reached the senior level, I found myself in a strange time where I didn\\u2019t know exactly what is the next step for me.\\n30. And again, I wasn\\u2019t noting down all of the wins that I achieved, instead, I focused on not knowing what is the next step going to be.\\n\\n31. And little did I know, the next step for me was right there clearly visible in my wins!\\n32. What was clear to me is that I am good at collaborating and communicating + managing expectations especially when it comes to projects and functionalities.\\n\\n33. That was also the reason why I thought that management was the right path for me.\\n34. It turned out that I was right!\\n\\n35.

This will ensure that you are ready if someone asks you and that you stay motivated!\\n\\n38. Paid subscribers, you can get it here:\\nHow to note down the wins?\\nDefine your goals that you wish to achieve.\\n39. The goals can be based on a year, month or also a week, it\\u2019s up to you.\\n40. My preference is yearly.\\n41. Here is an example of goals for a Software Engineer (from the template).\\n\\n42. Whenever you make a certain achievement, make sure to note it down in the List of Achievements.\\n43. This will ensure that nothing gets lost and you are prepared to talk about your achievements anytime!\\n\\n44. This is also my personal template that I use to note down all of the wins that I achieve.\\n\\n45. Here is what others are saying\\nKeeping track of my wins, and quantifying them in a way that shows my impact to not only engineering, but also business, product, and sales \\u2013 has been one of the best things I\\u2019ve ever done for myself.\\n46. It\\u2019s paid off massively in interviewing, promotion conversations, personal growth, seeing my own wins, focusing on where I can have the highest impact, etc.\\n\\u2014 Caleb Mellas, Senior Software Engineer / Tech Lead and Author of Level up software engineering \\ud83d\\ude80\\n\\n47. I've started doing this and it's changed my mindset.\\n48. And that's not even counting the concrete outcome of having all the facts and figures down.\\n\\n49. \\u2014 John Gallagher, Senior Software Engineer and Programming Coach\\nOne of the most most important question I ask in my 1-1 is: What are your wins over the since we last talked, and how do we celebrate them?\\n\\u2014\\n50. Tehn Yit Chin, Software Development Team Lead\\nRecording both big and small wins as a software engineer is important.\\n51. It helps you stay motivated, especially during challenging times in your software engineering journey.\\n\\u2014 Desmond Nzubechukwu, Software Engineer and Author of Inside Web Development\\nIn my opinion, writing down our victories and successes allows us to have a greater awareness of ourselves, our abilities and strengths.\\n52. Such a list is very useful on those days when it seems like everything is going wrong!\\n\\u2014 Gabriele Marini, CTO\\nLast words\\nNo matter your title or your role, this is what you should be doing.\\n53.

The Elves are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities.\\n\\nWhile the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).\\n\\nThe polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do not react.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nIn aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.\\nIn abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.\\nIn abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.\\nIn aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.\\nNow, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:\\n\\ndabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.\\ndabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.\\ndabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).\\ndabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.\\nAfter all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.\\n\\nHow many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned? (Note: in this puzzle and others, the input is large; if you copy/paste your input, make sure you get the whole thing.)\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 11636.\\n\\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nTime to improve the polymer.\\n\\nOne of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from collapsing as much as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its length.\\n\\nFor example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:\\n\\nRemoving all A/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.\\nRemoving all B/b units produces daAcCaCAcCcaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daCAcaDA, which has length 8.\\nRemoving all C/c units produces dabAaBAaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daDA, which has length 4.\\nRemoving all D/d units produces abAcCaCBAcCcaA. Fully reacting this polymer produces abCBAc, which has length 6.\\nIn this example, removing all C/c units was best, producing the answer 4.\\n\\nWhat is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all units of exactly one type and fully reacting the result?\\n```\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Convicted felon, Con man, alleged thief, and online stalker & chaos agent. Although Mr. Schoenberger claims limited contact and interaction with Isaac, he has both been accused of having something to do with the death of Isaac Kappy and made allegations himself that others (Manny Chavez III, Gabe Hoffman, Kelly Gianinni, Brett Trimble, and recently myself) are responsible for Isaac\\u2019s death. Mr. Schoenberger is currently embroiled as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by Gabe Hoffman for these accusations. Mr. Hoffman has also sued and/or threatened to sue several other people (including myself) for perceived defamation surrounding the Isaac Kappy event.\\n\\nAfter nearly a year and a half of investigation into the death of Isaac Kappy, it does not shock me in the least to know that Isaac was approached by Thomas Schoenberger early on when Isaac first came out with his allegations of Hollywood pedophilia. I believe Thomas S. not only knows more about the death of Isaac Kappy than he\\u2019ll ever admit but also Isaac\\u2019s mental breakdown prior to it. After all the investigation, bullshit, lies, diversion, and misdirection there are a few simple reasons I believe this.\\n\\nThe laundry list of Mr. Schoenberger\\u2019s victims who have come out of the woodwork accusing him of \\u201cmind-fucking\\u201d them. Most of them claim that Thomas personally led to their emotional and psychological breakdown resulting in loss of work, income, savings, and health, requiring in many circumstances hospitalization/medical attention/loss of income/depression & terror.\\nThe Judas Prophecy. See (The Judas Prophecy here.)\\nIsaac Kappy\\u2019s mental breakdown (fear, terror, paranoia) closely follows the same pattern as many of Thomas Schoenberger\\u2019s other victims.\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s jacket. T.S. has a lifetime involvement with online scams, drama, bad business deals, intimidation, stalking, litigation, and convictions. (You can find many of his court case PDF records below).\\nThomas\\u2019s attempt to pull me into his online war with Defango, Lestat, Gabe Hoffman, and others in order to derail my investigation.\\nThomas\\u2019s attempts to pull me into scams and online harassment of others in order to compromise myself while attempting to work me into a position of vulnerability wherein I would require Thomas\\u2019s assistance and protection. BTW, this is Thomas\\u2019s Modus Operandi. All communications, emails, text messages, phone calls, etc are recorded, stored, and later used as leverage/blackmail when Thomas will eventually turn on you, or threaten to do so. Social media is awash with videos and recordings of Mr. Schoenberger threatening just this. AND, of course, he has already made this treat to me as well.\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s self-proclaimed association with 3-letter government agencies. Primarily the CIA. According to witnesses I\\u2019ve interviewed, Thomas has bragged and boasted his entire life (since his early 20\\u2019s) that his father worked for the CIA as did he. Whereas this may or may not be true, I have spoken with three different people who\\u2019ve known Thomas his entire life and state that he has told them this. Thomas may very well believe this himself, or he could simply be a 3-letter agency asset, used to create chaos and execute online harassment/movement/etc. Admittedly, this is pure speculation, however, it is well within the realm of possibilities.\\nIt is important to note that with all the allegations of gang stocking and intentional psychological trauma, Thomas alleges he had no known dealings or knowledge of either Eliahi Priest or Gabe Hoffman prior to Isaac coming forward with his Hollywood Pedophilia allegations. Many Chavez III (Defango) however, knew and had worked with them both. It was also Defango who introduced Isaac to Mr. Priest.\\n\\nIT IS MY OPINION THAT THOMAS SCHOENBERGER IS A MONSTER IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. BASED ON FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE MR. SCHOENBERGER IS EASILY ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE SHEER NUMBER OF VICTIMS I HAVE SPOKEN TO HAVE ATTESTED TO THE TRAIL OF PAIN, DESTRUCTION & LOSS THOMAS SCHOENBERGER HAS BROUGHT TO THEM & OTHERS THROUGH HIS PERPETUAL NARCISTIC FUELED CHAOS AND MENTAL & EMOTIONAL TORTURE. ALL OF THIS DONE TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF FINANCIALLY THROUGH HIS CONS WHILE PROVIDING HIS NARCISSISTIC SUPPLY. IN SHORT, THOMAS SCHOENBERGER IS ONE OF THE MOST DISGUSTING PEOPLE I\\u2019VE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE TO KNOW AND THE DAY HE PAYS FOR HIS CRIMES WON\\u2019T COME SOON ENOUGH.\\n\\nThe following tweet was made by the \\u201cAn Open Secret\\u201d Twitter account which is operated by Gabe Hoffman.\\nThomas Schoenberger and Gabe Hoffman are currently embroiled in a defamation lawsuit filed by Mr. Hoffman. Whereas Mr. Hoffman had come out with the following tweet 14 days after the death of Isaac Kappy, Mr. Schoenberger has since outrightly accused Mr. Hoffman of being directly involved with the death of Isaac Kappy.\\n\\nIsaac Kappy suicide:\\n\\nFriends and concerned parties should focus research on\\n\\nThomas Schoenberger aka Thomas St Germain & Cicada 3301\\n\\nTS has a long documented history of gang-stalking, psychological manipulation & nefarious activities\\n\\n\\u2014 An Open Secret (@AnOpenSecret) May 27, 2019\\n\\nWho is Thomas Schoenberger\\nSurely you don\\u2019t mean the polymath, composer, historian, entrepreneur, event designer, inventor, and writer?\\n\\nYup, I mean the very one.\\n\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s website \\u2013 https://www.thomasschoenberger.com/blog/\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s \\u201cSophia Musik\\u201d YouTube Channel \\u2013 https://www.youtube.com/c/SophiaMusik/videos\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s Sound Cloud.com Site \\u2013 https://soundcloud.com/user-413210604\\nThomas Schoenberger\\u2019s \\u201cTrueBlood\\u201d Stalking YouTube Channel \\u2013 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLUtW6ELvnvTt8iJKC0sW8Q\\nBandcamp \\u2013 https://thomasschoenbergerclassicalical.bandcamp.com/\\nLinkedin \\u2013 https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-schoenberger-69b93370/\\nFrom the front page of Thomas Schoenberger\\u2019s website.\\n\\nThomas Schoenberger is a polymath, composer, historian, entrepreneur event designer, inventor, and writer. His compositions have been performed by leading musical groups, including the Moscow Chamber Orchestra and other notable artists worldwide. His historical observations are developed through his extensive travels throughout Europe, the Middle East, and America.\\n\\nAn unusually prolific composer, he has created thousands of original compositions, from piano concertos to symphonies and operas.\\n\\nQuite the portfolio for a man with no job, no studio, no partners (only past partners who have sued him and have warned the world about Thomas afterward), and who\\u2019s past tax records report next to no income. It\\u2019s also quite the portfolio for a man who\\u2019s been accused by multiple people of RELENTLESS STALKING, HARASSMENT, and EMOTIONAL TORMENT. Reading his bio you\\u2019d think he was the reincarnation of St. Germain.\\n\\nOH WAIT, NOT ONLY DOES THOMAS REFER TO HIMSELF AS ST. GERMAIN, AND DID SO IN AN INTERVIEW WITH ME, HE HAS TOLD MANY PEOPLE HE BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE THE REINCARNATION OF ST. GERMAIN.\\n\\nFrom Wikipedia\\n\\nCount Saint Germain (also sometimes referred to as Master R\\u00e1k\\u00f3czi or Master R) is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various Theosophical and post-Theosophical teachings, said to be responsible for the New Age culture of the Age of Aquarius and identified with the Count Saint Germain (fl. 1710\\u20131784), who has been variously described as a courtier, adventurer, inventor, alchemist, pianist, violinist, and amateur composer.\\n\\nThe Many Faces of Thomas Schoenberger\\nThomas Schoenberger has attempted to keep his photos off of social media to the greatest extent possible in an attempt to minimize exposure. I believe this is in an attempt to isolate his online stalking behavior from his legitimate musical career business (Sophia Music) which is big in Europe. Still victims of T.S. continue to post and share his photos in their effort to warn others about him.\\n\\nunnamed \\nFullSizeRender-1 \\nFullSizeRender-2 \\nThomas-circa-1984 \\nFullSizeRender-4 \\nOLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA \\ndownload-1 \\nFullSizeRender \\nFullSizeRender-3 \\nimages-1 \\nhqdefault \\ndownload \\nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-40-778 \\nimages \\nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-18-204 \\nbandicam-2020-11-22-17-35-29-486 \\nbandicam-2020-12-09-23-24-17-638\\n[SHOW SLIDESHOW]\\nVictims & Survivors of Thomas Schoenberger\\nThis section is dedicated to outlining & sharing the already public information/stories/testimonies/ PDF court documents/ related to those individuals whom Thomas Schoenberger has victimized over the course of his lifetime. \\nKathy Litton (1979)\\nRick Holliday \\u2013 Claims that T.S. was a cocaine user/dealer, professional thief, and con artist.

You can look for \\\"M\\\", \\\"C\\\", \\\"D\\\", \\\"T\\\", etc. The letter-resembling object will be one pixel thick and made of multiple adjoined pixel lines. In this case, the letter \\\"I\\\" is disqualified because our object is made of at least two pixel lines.\\n\\n7) The following is how to extract the object we have chosen.\\n\\n- First, we count the number of pixels wide and tall, that the object is, at the largest. This will allow us to know what size of bounding box to create, and how to copy the object to a final pixel grid, which is the size of the bounding box.\\n\\nBelow is how to count the pixels of an arbitrary object, presented on a pixel grid with a background of empty pixels as well as colored pixels that blend in with the actual object we want to extract, so you can clearly see how to count them.\\n\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n\\nThe pixel grid above has ten(10) rows and ten(10) columns.

As Joe said, that's more work on our part to custom code everything but no third party company is going to satisfactorily solve the problem for us. If it was just about syncing force plates and cameras (and emg), we could just pay MotionMonitor $20,000 upfront + $2,000/year to do that for us and be set in < 2 months. I know Joe hates their old-ass looking software but, hey, I'm looking forward to the day Visual3D doesn't look like it's from Windows 95 too.\\nThe simplest (internal) framework (but more custom) in my head is the one Joe outlined: autotrigger acts as master sync signal and sends trigger to force plates + edgers (via DAQ or similar). Custom force plate ring buffer software works like Edger pre/post trigger and, assuming the autotrigger signal timing arrives close enough between the plates and the edgers, we have in-sync pre/post trigger recordings from both. This leaves out EMG, which I think is ok for at-largest-scale assessments, although moving to a DAQ would theoretically allow us to talk to the EMG too.\\nEMG's role in my mind is focused to dedicated projects where more invasive custom collection protocols are employed; the most relevant of which is building and refining the forward dynamics model: we collect a sample of athletes with markered, theia, force plates, and EMG rolling. Adding the EMG inputs to the forward dynamics + CMC pipelines allows us to develop a better model which we can then approximate without EMG at scale at every location that has mocap.\\nI do not have many, if any, concerns with mapping theia data back to markered mocap data. The paired sample is pretty impressive already and will only continue to grow over the next couple months before we're ready to flip the switch to markerless only. Mapping POIs will be just a matter of using theia POIs to predict markered POIs on a POI by POI basis. Mapping composite scores may or may not be needed, we could just rerun Besky's model development scripts and come up with new composite score questions that are unique to theia data.\\nIf there is a concern with mapping theia to markered, it would be the relative lack of academy data in the current paired dataset. May need additional youth collections to make those conversions robust enough.\\n:fire:\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe Marsh\\n:red_wolves:  4:21 PM\\nI'll add some additional forward dynamics thoughts -\\nThe short version is that we can probably do simulational things without force plates (but handicapped at the level of insights we would get - e.g. we can simulate to optimize for bat speed or velo, but we would be unable to get any insights about actual arm stress). We could 100% NOT do anything in the realm of actual computed muscle control insights.\\nCMC/ Forward Dynamics:\\nRequires synced force plate data to calculate muscle activations\\nRequires EMG to optimize muscle activation profiles\\nThe final product will *basically always require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says elbow stress is high given the ATHs mechanics/ strength levels\\nI say basically always need force plates because there probably exists a world where estimated force plate values are good enough to get what we need\\ntbh I haven't ever looked at the data that like KinaTrax spits out here\\nBertec was interested in offering some sort of product here, I think they know that there exists a world where force plates are never necessary again\\nEMG is primarily needed to improve muscle activation profiles\\nSimulations:\\nDon't require force plates to simulate for certain mechanics profiles (e.g. optimize for velo or bat speed)\\nDon't require EMG data at all, really\\nForce plates do add value to simulational insights separate from the CMC things noted above\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for force put into the bat\\ne.g. optimize mechanics for knee valgus torques (idk why you would want this, but whatever)\\nFinal product here doesn't necessarily require force plates\\ne.g. ATH mocaps, gets a report that says you could increase velo by X mph by doing XYZ\\nit's possible that the suggested mechanical changes (which aren't using FP data in this instance) are actually impractical due to increases in elbow stress, which is another need for force plates\\nIt's sort of a not all rectangles are squares, but all squares are rectangles situation -- Simulations are a component of the CMC insights, but CMC insights aren't necessarily part of the simulation insights.\\nThere's also the combined Simulation/ CMC report which is some sort of deliverables that tell the athlete\\nincrease your velo by doing XYZ\\ndecrease your arm stress by doing ABC\\noptimize for velo and arm stress by doing IJK\\nThat's a bunch of salad but I think we should sync the force plates to actually get the value out of them that we want to get out of them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

{"id": "meta:116274384", "input": "{\"scoring_data\": [{\"input\": \"I write this post but it lacks the first paragrph which uses to make this post catch readers at the first time: Understand Low Resolution and High-Resolution Images\\nLow Resolution vs High-Resolution Images\\nIn the world of digital imagery, resolution is essentially the sum of all the pixels that make up an image, which you calculate by multiplying the width by the height in pixels.\\n\\nTake an image with dimensions of 640 by 480 pixels as an example. This means there are 640 pixels across the width and 480 pixels along the height, totaling 307,200 pixels. On the other hand, an image with dimensions of 3840 by 2160 pixels boasts a much higher pixel count of 8,294,400.\\n\\nThe number of pixels is crucial because it determines an image's detail level. With a higher resolution, you can expect to see more intricate details, making such images ideal for high-quality prints, stunning desktop wallpapers, and sophisticated fine art reproductions. Moreover, high-resolution images are a perfect match for high-definition screens, which is something you may already noticed. For instance, 4K photos from DSLRs are sharp on 4K screens, but 480P images appear fuzzy and pixelated on the same monitor. While low-res images are adequate on smartphones, the pixelation becomes pronounced on larger displays and in computer presentations, making them unsuitable for professional use.\\nDefinition of High Resolution and Low Resolution Images\\n1. Low Resolution Images:\\nDefinition: Low-resolution images generally have a pixel count under 1 million.\\nExample: An image with dimensions 1024x768 pixels gives a total pixel count of 786,432 pixels.\\nUsage: These images are suitable for viewing on most standard screens. However, when enlarged, they may lose quality.\\n\\n2. High Resolution Images:\\nDefinition: High-resolution images have a larger number of pixels, usually over 2 million.\\nExample: A 1920x1080 image (Full HD) has over 2 million pixels, and a 3840x2160 image (4K UHD) has over 8 million pixels.\\nUsage: These images provide more detail and can be enlarged more before losing quality.\\n\\n\\nLow or High Image Resolution in Printing\\nFor images intended for printing, the resolution is typically measured in DPI (dots per inch), with high-resolution generally considered to be at least 300 DPI. This means there are 300 dots of color for each inch of the printed image. The higher the DPI, the better the quality of the print.\\n\\nFor a 6000x4000 pixel photo intended for printing at 300 DPI, the calculations reveal a resulting print size of approximately 20x13 inches at high quality (300 DPI). To print the photo larger without compromising quality, a higher-resolution photo would be required.\\nCan You Convert a Low-Resolution Image to High Resolution\\nIn short answer: Yes, thanks to advancements in technology, you can convert a low-resolution image to a high-resolution image using AI-based upscaling techniques. \\n\\nTraditional upscaling methods like bilinear, bicubic, and Lanczos interpolation primarily increase the size of an image without enhancing its quality. By estimating values based on surrounding pixels, these methods generate additional pixels via interpolation, resulting in a larger but potentially blurry or pixelated image. The original detail present in high-resolution images isn't truly added or captured through this process.\\n\\nAI-based upscaling method, on the other hand, can do more than increasing the image size. It can add new details and remove quality issues like choppy edges and noise. For instance, Super Resolution, one of the most advanced AI upscaling techniques, learns from huge sets of low and high-resolution images. By studying patterns and textures, it figures out what the new pixels in the upscaled image should look like. This allows it to not only make the image larger but also significantly improve its clarity and realism. In simple terms, the AI fills in the gaps, making the image bigger and better, adding missing details for sharper and more realistic results.\\n\\nHow to Convert Low Resolution Images to High Resolution\\nA variety of image upscaler can help convert resolution image to high resolution. Let\\u2019s say how to convert low resolution images to high resolution in 4 easiest ways.\\n\\nUse VideoProc Converter AI\\nVideoProc Converter AI can convert images from low resolution such as 480P and 560P to 1080P, 2K, 4K, and even 8K resolution. Thanks to the application of the advanced Super Resolution technology, it can recognize intricate patterns and features in the original image, then intelligently predicts what should be added to the new pixels, resulting in a remarkable up to 400% increase in resolution while preserving the original details without introducing any unwanted artifacts. Better yet, it comes with different models to convert low-resolution real-life images and animes more efficiently and get the best possible result.\\n\\nVideoProc Converter AI - A Game-Changing AI Image Upscaler\\n\\uf06c\\tUpscale JPEG, PNG, PBM, WebP, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, PPM, PGM, etc\\n\\uf06c\\tConvert low resolution images to up to 8K high resolution\\n\\uf06c\\tIntelligently interpolate pixels without distortion or pixelation\\n\\uf06c\\tDenoising, frame interpolation, stabilization, and more AI features\\n\\uf06c\\tConvert, compress, quick-edit, screen record, and download videos.\\n\\nStep 1. Download, install, and launch VideoProc Converter AI. Hit Super Resolution. \\nStep 2. Drag and drop your images into the software. Select the image type, and VideoProc Converter AI will intelligently apply the most suitable AI upscale model.\\nChoose Reality for real-world photos and scenes, such as old family photos or landscape shots from older cameras.\\nChoose Anime when handling illustrations and graphics, such as logos or text with blurriness and compression artifacts.\\n\\nStep 3. Choose the desired scale - 2x, 3x, or 4x - to increase the image resolution. For example, if your low-resolution source image is 512x512, selecting 2x will transform it into 1024x1024, 3x into 1526x1526, and 4x into 2048x2048.\\n\\nTip: You can apply the same settings to multiple images or right-click on the current image in the list. \\n\\nStep 4. Select the output image format, and then click RUN to export the high-resolution image. You can also repeat the upscaling process multiple times before reaching the maximum output of 8K, which is nearly 8,000 pixels in width.\\n\\nUse Fotor\\nFotor has been available in the market for over a decade, establishing itself as a versatile photo editing tool accessible both online and as installed software. Beyond basic photo editing functions like cropping and resizing, Fotor sets itself apart with a set of AI-powered features that simplify complex edits with a single click. The background remover, for instance, lets you remove background from your photo effortlessly within seconds. It has a powerful AI Photo Enhance. Notably, it uses artificial intelligence to instantly improve image quality and convert low resolution images to high resolution without making your images too sharp. However, this tool has limitations for users wanting to convert very low-resolution images to high resolution, as it only supports up to 2X resolution upscaling. Let\\u2019s say, if your original image is 480 x 480P, Fotor can only upscale it to 960 x 960, which is not considered high resolution.\\n\\nStep 1. Navigate yourself to the Photo Enhancer tool of Fotor.\\nStep 2. Click Enhance Photo Now and select the source low-resolution images for loading to Fotor. It now automatically converts your low-resolution images to high-resolution. \\nStep 3. Hit Apply to confirm the changes in the resolution.

The Image Enhancer tool seamlessly upscales images by 2x, 4x, or 8x the original resolution, converting low-resolution images into crisp, high-resolution versions. With access to various upscaling AI models, it intelligently processes photos, anime, CG art, text, and even extremely blurry images using specialized models to deliver optimal results. Plus, users can also adjust blur levels and remove noticeable noise in their images. However, it supports only JPEG, JPG, and PNG images. Another disappointing thing is, while VanceAI does not mention any payment upfront and only requires creating an account, after users upload an image for enhancement, it then prompts for payment before allowing them to download the upscaled high-resolution version.\\n\\nStep 1. Go to VanceAI.com and click on AI Image Upscaler under the Products menu.\\nStep 2. Click the Upload Image button and select the low-resolution image you want to upscale on your computer.\\nStep 3. Choose the desired upscale ratio or target resolution for the image. Optionally adjust the Suppress Noise and Remove Blur sliders if needed.\\nStep 4. Click Start to Process to have VanceAI convert your low-resolution image to high resolution. Once processing is complete, you can compare the before and after images side-by-side.\\nStep 5. Go to the Output Settings section and select JPEG or PNG format. You can also adjust the DPI to 72 for digital printing, 300 for high-quality print, or a custom value. \\nStep 6. Click OK. VanceAI will export the high-resolution upscaled image converted from your original low-resolution source image.\\n\\nGigapixel AI\\nTopaz Gigapixel AI is an artificial intelligence-powered software that can effectively convert low-resolution images to high resolution by enlarging images up to 600% their original size while maintaining sharpness and quality. Its machine learning algorithms are continuously trained to learn how to examine patterns and details in order to recreate missing data when upscaling.

You'll be prompted to download the model files (around 2GB total) used to enhance your photos. You can click OK or choose to download specific models later.\\nStep 4. Drag and drop the source low-resolution images to the program. \\nStep 5. Select the desired scale ratio from the options (2x, 4x, 6x). This determines the resolution of the high-resolution version.\\nStep 6. Go to AI Models and pick the target model that decides how the AI will enhance image details.\\nStep 7. Topaz Gigapixel AI will start converting your low-res images to high-res. \\nStep 8. Click \\\"Save Images\\\" to save the processed images to your computer.\\n\\nCutout.Pro\\nCutOut.pro is a visual design platform powered by artificial intelligence. It offers tools not just for enhancing photos, but also for generating creative and visually-appealing designs from scratch.

The near-indistinguishable similarities among such objects, combined with the dearth of sample data, intensify this challenge. In response, we introduce the FDCL-DA, an innovative method integrating Foreground-background feature Distillation (FD) and Contrastive feature Learning (CL) with Dual Augmentation (DA). We use two different data augmentation techniques, standard augmentation and auxiliary augmentation, to improve model performance and enhance generalization ability. The FD module assiduously curtails superfluous features while augmenting the contrast between the principal entity and its backdrop. Concurrently, the CL module is devoted to sculpting unique data imprints by reducing intra-class resemblances and bolstering inter-class disparities. Integrating our method on different architectures (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Swin-Transformer (Swin-T)) greatly improves these backbone networks. Especially with the integration with Swin-T, commendable results have been achieved on eight popular datasets, providing a promising way to improve the performance of super FGVC tasks.\\n\\nSummarize the above abstract into less than 150 words.

{"id": "meta:72140361", "input": "{\"scoring_data\": [{\"input\": \"I'd like to debate a topic from a book I've read.\\n\\nWhen someone learns how to use an interface, it gets easier for them over time, up to a certain extent. It has been posited that, by definition, \\u201clearning effort\\u201d is effort that can be reduced by learning. By contrast, \\u201cperma effort\\u201d is the effort that cannot be reduced, thereby forming a baseline.\\n\\nFor example, a user might learn that the easiest way to complete a process is to push a set of six buttons in the correct order. It takes them effort to figure out the correct order, but once they figure it out, this is no longer a difficulty for them. Instead, from that point on, the only effort they face is the effort inherent to pressing those six buttons in the correct order. Every interaction has a baseline of cognitive and physical effort that cannot be reduced beyond a certain point.\\n\\nZipf's Law (aka the Principle of Least Effort) would suggest that users are endeavoring to reduce the total amount of effort required to reach their goals, now and into the future, to the best of their knowledge. After a user learns a way of completing a task (thereby allowing them to reach a goal), any additional effort they spend relearning how to complete that task in another way must be offset by reduced perma effort. For example, a user may choose to learn how to complete a familiar task using keyboard shortcuts, thereby trading additional learning effort for reduced perma effort.\\n\\nIn other words, if a user receives a redesigned interface that reduces the learning effort required but increases the perma effort required, they would become frustrated\\u2014or infuriated, given the permanent nature of this effort. A well-meaning product team that validates an interface using traditional usability testing may have false confidence that the new interface is \\\"more usable\\\", and thereby requires less effort, but they may have only reduced learning effort. In this way, the tools used by product teams can lead to users receiving updated products that are in fact harder to use, and this is exacerbated by the concepts of learnability and usability often falsely being conflated. This would seem to evince a need to identify issues with perma effort up front, in the design phase, instead of waiting until users provide feedback after they have been saddled with a worsened experience.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is argued that every interface has a Path of Least Perma Effort (or PLPE). This reflects the set of steps required to complete a task with the least amount of perma effort. This can vary by user and situation \\u2014 a PLPE might involve using voice commands, but if a user is permanently or even temporarily unable to speak, they won't have this option available to them. This means their PLPE involves a different set of steps. Overall, this would seem to imply that there is benefit to creating redundancies for completing tasks so that a better PLPE might be available according to a user's context and current abilities. While this might seem to imply a dynamic or context-aware system, these systems are hard to build and can lead to unpredictability. Instead, it is suggested that a system should be adaptable based on context and abilities by the end user, themselves.\\n\\nThe author introduces the idea of comparing interfaces on the basis of these two types of effort, due to how each type of effort will affect users differently. These will influence the choices users make about the tools they use. They do this using what they call a Usability Matrix, which allows for a better understanding of different options given their relative positions in this matrix.\\n\\nThe author also expresses bewilderment that these concepts aren\\u2019t more widely understood or discussed. They say they suspect this may be due in part to the fact that early usability books were written when most people were new to computers, and a second wave of seminal usability writing came out when kiosk-like websites were on the rise. Compared to today, computers (and other digital devices) didn\\u2019t get nearly the same amount of prolonged use.\\n\\nHow do you think this book may have been received when it was released in 2023? Given what you know about it, what do you think a likely rating on Amazon would be? Give me an example of what a highly positive review might say versus what a highly negative review might say.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

It was no-doubt enough to convince some critics of one of the world's biggest fast food chains that it isn't all bad, but health experts still say that no matter how hygienic the conditions of the 612 KFC outlets in Australia are, the food they make just isn't good for you. The franchise allowed hundreds of people to take a look behind the scene of 219 stores and roam from freezer to fryer while watching staff continue their daily cooking and preparation tasks, in a bid to prove their chicken is fresh and there's nothing to hide. Scroll down for video . KFC\\u00a0allowed hundreds of people to tour the back of 219 stores across Australia and roam from freezer to fryer on Saturday . The fast food giant hoped to dispel myths around the quality and freshness of their ingredients and prove their chicken was fresh and cooked in the kitchen of each store . 'They'll see exactly what happens, we haven't airbrushed anything,' Nikki Lawson, Chief Marketing and Development Officer for KFC, told Daily Mail Australia. 'They'll see exactly how it's done, they'll get to look in the fridges at the ingredients and the products we've got, they'll be able to watch the cooks making the chicken and the burgers being assembled and how its eventually served to the customer.' Ms Lawson said the fast food giant hoped to dispel 'blanket perceptions' of negativity around the quality and freshness of their ingredients. 'It's not something that's made in a factory offsite somewhere and it gets delivered here and we reheat it,' she said. 'If you look at the ingredients and processes we use, it's actually like fabulous home cooked food, and it's just done in a slightly bigger commercial kitchen.' Daily Mail Australia attended an earlier tour of the KFC store outside Sydney's Airport in Mascot, alongside four couples who had registered as skeptics and fans . In one of two\\u00a0cool rooms, selections of raw chicken were seen packed in boxes marked with use by dates and the type of cut: whole chickens, zingers cuts, wings etc. A senior cook was then seen flouring and seasoning batches of the selections by hand, before distributing them between one of the six fry\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

This reshuffling of the layer norms is considered an improvement in terms of model performance and training dynamics.\\n\\nBy reshuffling the layer norms to a pre-norm formulation, researchers have found that it can lead to better convergence during training and improved overall performance of the Transformer model.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}
