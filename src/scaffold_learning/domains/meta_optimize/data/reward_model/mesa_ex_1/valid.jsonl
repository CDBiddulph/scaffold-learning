{"id": "meta:43053669", "input": "{\"scoring_data\": [{\"input\": \"Summarize this article:\\n\\nAmabel Holland, a forty-one-year-old board-game designer from Dearborn, Michigan, believes that a chance discovery at a comic-book store saved her life. In 2010, she wandered into the shop with her wife and a friend, looking for issues of the Marvel series \\u201cThe New Mutants.\\u201d In the basement, she noticed a board game called The Settlers of Catan. It was a 3-D edition, costing more than two hundred dollars. Amabel didn\\u2019t particularly want to play the game, but she was surprised by its fanciness. She browsed the store some more and noticed that many games\\u2019 boxes prominently displayed the names of their designers, as if they were authors. This wasn\\u2019t the familiar childhood terrain of Monopoly, Candy Land, and Sorry! These games were often dauntingly complex, and engaged with topics like history, politics, and the building of industries and empires.\\n\\nAfter visiting the store, Amabel and her wife, Mary Holland, played a few board games, and eventually Amabel tried designing one. She\\u2019d spent years creating music, comics, and films without attracting much of an audience, and had felt some despair about her artistic work. But Amabel, who is autistic, thinks about the world in terms of systems, and she suspected that in games she might find her voice. You could make a board game about almost anything, and, when you did, its rules could both mirror and analyze the subject on which it was based.\\n\\nOver the next few years, Amabel designed and published about thirty games through various companies. Then, in 2016, she and Mary created their own publisher, Hollandspiele. It\\u2019s since published more than seventy games, roughly half designed by Amabel; she is widely considered one of today\\u2019s most innovative game designers. Her work, which is part of a larger turn toward complexity in the industry, often tackles historical and social subjects\\u2014death, religion, misinformation\\u2014using surprising \\u201cmechanics,\\u201d or building blocks of game play, to immerse players in an experience. \\u201cI\\u2019m interested in games\\u2019 ability to engage with difficult topics,\\u201d she told me. \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m interested in the way that mechanics can be used to do that.\\u201d\\n\\nMechanics can be appealingly simple, as they are in checkers. But games with richer mechanics can offer richer experiences. In Monopoly, which was published in 1935, you can roll dice to move, auction assets, build properties on tiles, and draw special-power cards (\\u201cGet Out of Jail Free\\u201d). Things escalate from there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s definitely been a lot of innovation in the last twenty years,\\u201d Amabel said. A recent encyclopedia of mechanics in tabletop games\\u2014a category that includes board games, card games (such as Magic: The Gathering), and party games (such as Codenames)\\u2014defines close to two hundred.\\n\\n\\u201cWith every game, you build a certain model of the world,\\u201d Reiner Knizia, a former mathematician who\\u2019s designed more than eight hundred games, told me. Several of his games illustrate market forces: in Modern Art, for instance, you play as auctioneers and buyers, hoping to buy low and sell high. Knizia is a traditional game designer inasmuch as he aims to \\u201cbring enjoyment to the people.\\u201d But Amabel sometimes aims for the opposite of enjoyment. Her game This Guilty Land, from 2018, is about the struggle to end slavery; The Vote, from 2020, is about women\\u2019s suffrage. \\u201cThey\\u2019re meant to evoke frustration,\\u201d she said\\u2014to demonstrate the difficulty of political progress\\u2014\\u201cwhich is not usually what people are looking for in games.\\u201d\\n\\nLately, Amabel has been trying to combine the heavy with the light. One of her newest games, Kaiju Table Battles, uses carefully calibrated mechanics to tackle the highly personal topic of gender transition in a way that is both uplifting and widely appealing. (Until 2021, she published under the name Tom Russell.) Through colorful, Godzilla-like creatures, it tells the story of how Amabel became Amabel.\\n\\nThe world of board games began to transform in the nineteen-nineties. Catan, which was first published in Germany, in 1995, helped popularize \\u201cEuro-style\\u201d games over \\u201cAmeritrash\\u201d titles that often depended on randomness, direct conflict, and dramatic shifts of fortune. (Back to square one!) Eurogames tended to reward planning, and allowed players to interact indirectly\\u2014by acquiring coveted building materials, for instance. Since then, the industry has seen a steady increase in complex games. In 2021, researchers analyzed the ten thousand games with the highest rankings on the Web site BoardGameGeek, and found that, between 2000 and 2020, the average number of mechanics in new games had increased from roughly two and a half to four. The 2017 game Gloomhaven, which held the highest rating on the site for years, utilizes nineteen mechanics.\\n\\n\\u201cDesigners are becoming more focussed on the experience the players are having, and are using a stronger tool kit to build better games,\\u201d Geoff Engelstein, who teaches board-game design at New York University and co-authored the encyclopedia of game mechanics, told me. In older games, he said, such as Risk and Monopoly, the goal was, frequently, to tear everyone else down, but in newer games this is often impossible; in the train game Ticket to Ride, for example, you can\\u2019t destroy other players\\u2019 tracks. It\\u2019s also become less common to lose a turn, which makes players less engaged, and games are increasingly designed to prevent blowouts by winners. Rob Daviau, the co-designer of Pandemic Legacy, the current No. 2 game on BoardGameGeek, is a co-owner of Restoration Games, a company that republishes older games while updating their mechanics. One common shift, he said, is from post-decision luck to pre-decision luck. Instead of striking a monster and then rolling the dice to see if you\\u2019ve caused damage, you roll the dice first, then have to get creative about how to use what you\\u2019ve rolled.\\n\\nA few games have introduced entirely new mechanics. Dominion, from 2008, popularized deck-building, in which players curate a collection of cards that grant points or powers. (The same mechanic is used in Magic: The Gathering.) Risk Legacy, another game co-designed by Daviau, inaugurated legacy games, in which \\u201cgame states\\u201d\\u2014changes to the board, characters, or rules\\u2014carry over from session to session. (Daviau, who once worked for Hasbro, came up with the concept while talking about Clue at a brainstorming session. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know why these people keep coming over to dinner!\\u201d he said.)\\n\\nAmabel\\u2019s game Kaiju Table Battles uses a legacy system: in the course of multiple sessions, players unseal envelopes containing new content. While working on it, she watched most of the Godzilla and Gamera movies; she also created her own monsters, commissioned art, and built a prototype. When I visited her, she was in the mechanics phase\\u2014\\u201cthe nitty gritty of figuring out, What exactly does this monster do?\\u201d she explained. In the movies, monsters like Godzilla represent big, intangible fears, such as the atomic bomb. But Amabel identified more with the strange beasts than with the people trying to kill them; she wanted to make a game in which the monsters developed and grew. One of her characters, a plant monster, would obey unique mechanics: it would be fragile and push other monsters away. \\u201cSo it\\u2019s very lonely and isolated,\\u201d Amabel said. \\u201cBut then it will evolve and go from being this kind of weird, viny, weedy plant to a flowering plant and come into its power. It\\u2019s going to be stronger, and actually help other monsters work better, and have more sense of community, because it\\u2019s actually acting as itself.\\u201d\\n\\nVideo From The New Yorker\\n\\nThe Night Doctrine: The Lives Lost to a U.S. Strategy in Afghanistan\\n\\nAmabel describes herself as a \\u201cshitposter\\u201d\\u2014someone who is wrong on purpose in a funny, adversarial way that can still get at the truth. On social media, where she writes about game design and her dating life\\u2014she and Mary separated, in 2021\\u2014she explains that, although many of her games are historical, they are not \\u201c \\u2018balanced\\u2019 works of history\\u201d but \\u201cpolitical art\\u201d and \\u201cqueer rage & shitposting all the way down.\\u201d Recently, she has published games about Dracula, the tobacco industry (her father died of lung cancer), and the Shackleton expedition. The latter game, called Endurance, has no \\u201cvictory condition\\u201d; your only hope is to limit your losses as crew members die. In reality, all of Ernest Shackleton\\u2019s men survived their failed attempt to reach the South Pole\\u2014but the game models the circumstances, not the outcome, and expresses deeper ideas about adversity. On a podcast hosted by the game reviewer Daniel Thurot, Amabel explained that she could not have made Endurance before her gender transition. \\u201cIt was kind of living through my own misery and my own miracle that made me think about the odds,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBecause the odds of me figuring out my shit were, like, so long.\\u201d She found time to think about her gender only because she\\u2019d left an office job to work on games full time; she undertook her transition with the help of a trans woman, Erin Escobedo, who\\u2019d created a game published by Hollandspiele; Escobedo, in turn, had learned about the company only because it had previously published a title by a big-time designer named Cole Wehrle, who knew Amabel because of Amabel\\u2019s first game, Northern Pacific. \\u201cIf all those things didn\\u2019t happen, I don\\u2019t know if I would be here today talking to you,\\u201d she told Thurot. Endurance is a game in which anything can, and usually does, go wrong.\\n\\nThe recent explosion in the popularity of board games\\u2014the industry\\u2019s annual revenue is expected to increase from around a billion dollars in 2017 to nearly five billion in 2026\\u2014has vastly expanded the number and variety of games that can be published. Crowdfunding, online communities, and on-demand printing have also contributed. Independent designers can now find dedicated audiences. The Zenobia Award celebrates designers from marginalized groups who are creating historical games; recent winning games have centered on subjects including caste in India under colonialism, the functions of Machu Picchu, and an economic system used by Cherokee people in the sixteenth century. In 2019, Elizabeth Hargrave released Wingspan, a beautifully illustrated Euro-style game about birds; nearly two million copies are in print. Historically, she told me, most players and designers and publishers of games have been men; the industry is slowly escaping their grip. \\u201cNot everybody enjoys killing monsters in dungeons,\\u201d said Isaac Childres, the designer of Gloomhaven, which is about killing monsters in dungeons.\\n\\nJohn du Bois, a game designer whom Hollandspiele has published, met me and Amabel at the apartment of Amabel\\u2019s girlfriend, Samhain Bones. (Bones, who named herself Samhain after the Halloween-adjacent pagan holiday when she transitioned a few years ago, had on a pink tank top that said \\u201cBE GAY DO CRIME!\\u201d and skeletal wrist warmers.) This gave us a foursome for sampling some modern games. We started with Amabel\\u2019s Northern Pacific. The board shows a network of potential paths connecting cities. Players must build train tracks connecting Minneapolis to Seattle; on each turn, they can either place a cube on a city and hope that a train comes there, or place a train on a track segment. One tactic is to see where an opponent might direct her trains and place your own cubes to reap the rewards. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about leaving your opponents with the most bad choices,\\u201d du Bois said.\\n\\nNext was Turncoats, from another publisher, Milda Matilda Games. A map contains eleven adjacent regions and a smattering of stones in three colors. Each player receives eight stones to hide in her hand; she can either place them on the map or take actions to alter their distribution in her hand or on the map. At the end of the game, the player who holds in her hand the color that has dominated the most regions on the map is the winner. The trick is to guide the board toward a certain color without depleting that color f\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

It features two doctors, understanding and open-minded Jerry Jefferies and imposing, sarcastic, cynical and upfront Basil Bends, talking to fashionable, beautiful, confident and assertive rich lady Adeline Widrich. Adeline's beautiful and adventurous daughter Irene is a patient in the clinic, being treated for her musculoskeletal issues, exacerbated by numerous accidents caused by Irene's reckless lifestyle. Irene has a history of interrupting her treatments and escaping from hospitals, thinking that her weird affairs and adventures are far more important, not even stopped by her limited mobility. This time, Adeline wants to make sure that Irene is thoroughly treated and recovers fully. However, Irene is adult and of sound mind, and doctors Bends and Jefferies state that if Irene doesn't want to be treated, they can't make her stay. Adeline promises considerable compensation if they find some loopholes or some legalese that would keep Irene in. Dr. Jefferies and Dr. Bends consider some ideas.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

In contrast short audio speech offers new avenues for regular self-assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive changes. This alternative tool for dementia and MCI screening, overcomes numerous limitations of traditional testing. Firstly, it can be conducted with minimal or no assistance from non-professional staff or family members, making it more flexible for anytime-anywhere assessment and thus feasible for regular cognitive change monitoring (8). This is particularly beneficial in light of the COVID pandemic's adverse impact on community healthcare routines (9). Additionally, the analytic platform integrated with the assessment tool enables efficient management of assessment data and automated execution of the entire assessment process. especially in low-income and rural areas where healthcare resources are limited, and people may not have access to traditional screening methods. In recent years, the use of short speeches for early dementia risk prediction has garnered significant research interest. Short audio events (SAEs) serve as promising biomarkers for predicting or identifying the risk for dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using machine learning or deep learning models(Javeed et al., 2023). \\\" \"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

They didn't say much, but occasionally talked with the other and picked an item up. \\\"No, it's not suitable for her and she dislikes it,\\\" one would say and move on. My curiosity always got the best of me until I satisfied it by asking. \\\"Can I help you find something?\\\" I asked. They stopped, looking at me. Then the man said,\\\"We are looking for old things that look new. Look,every new year in the past we tried to begin the year with new things. It was a goal to surround ourselves with things fresh and new so that we had new direction, new hopes and dreams for the year ahead. More importantly, we can give some gifts to Eva.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Eva? Who is she?\\\" I asked. \\\"She is a lovely 10-year-old girl(we adopted three years ago. Her parents died in a serious traffic accident. She always wants to be a singer,\\\"the man replied.

In recent decades, the world has witnessed the alarming consequences of neglecting our environmental responsibilities, including climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and pollution. It is imperative that we acknowledge our role in these issues and take proactive steps to care for the environment to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.\\n\\nOne of the most pressing environmental concerns of our time is climate change. The burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, along with deforestation and other human activities, has led to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing global temperatures to rise. The consequences of climate change are already evident, with more frequent and severe weather events, melting glaciers and polar ice, and rising sea levels threatening coastal communities. Taking care of the environment means reducing our carbon footprint by transitioning to renewable energy sources, conserving energy, and promoting sustainable transportation options.\\n\\nBiodiversity is another critical aspect of the environment that requires our attention. Ecosystems around the world are in danger due to habitat destruction, pollution, and over-exploitation. The loss of biodiversity not only threatens the survival of countless species but also disrupts the delicate balance of nature. As stewards of the Earth, we must protect and restore ecosystems, conserve endangered species, and support sustainable agriculture and forestry practices to maintain the web of life upon which we depend.\\n\\nPollution, both in the air and water, poses a significant threat to human health and the environment. From the plastics clogging our oceans to the air pollution causing respiratory diseases, we must make a concerted effort to reduce our waste and minimize our carbon and chemical footprints. Recycling, reducing single-use plastics, and supporting clean technologies are effective ways to address these issues.\\n\\nThe health of our environment is intrinsically linked to the health of our own communities. Access to clean air and water, green spaces, and a sustainable food supply are all essential for human well-being. Pollution and environmental degradation disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need for environmental justice and equitable access to a healthy environment for all.\\n\\nEducation plays a crucial role in caring for the environment. Awareness and understanding of environmental issues are the first steps towards meaningful change. By teaching the principles of sustainability, conservation, and responsible consumption, we can empower individuals to make informed choices that benefit the planet. Schools, communities, and governments should prioritize environmental education as an integral part of the curricu\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is reported.

She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant. She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement. She was re-induced with nelarabine 1500 mg/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 with 1 dose of IT cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. At the time of treatment, she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). She tolerated therapy well, entered a complete remission, and recovered her renal function. She received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional IT prophylaxis one month later. A week after this second cycle, she noted numbness in her lower extremities.

Be as critical as you can and thorough as well. Continue the message where (...) is present and be highly involved with solving the problem with having Regulars get involved with High-Rankers (godlike opposition) way too seamlessly by SIU's writing.\\n</format>\\n\\n<text> In season 1, there were multiple, interesting narratives being explored by an interesting, dynamic cast. Baam was mostly the protagonist, but other stories and characters were able to coexist comfortably alongside Baam.\\n\\nIn season 2, the narratives of Baam's party are greatly much less explored. They still had decent roles here and there, such as in the Workshop Battle, trying to deal with Viole/Bam throughout the tournament. But starting with the extensive Hell Train journey, it becomes mostly about Baam, while the people around him\\u2014his sidekicks, his companions\\u2014they take a noticeable backseat regarding their role within the story.\\n\\nIn season 3, the story has been fully utilizing Baam as the sole dominant main character, with the other past characters being further less maintenanced.\\n\\nThis maintenance problem compounds itself because SIU keeps avoiding giving meaningful depth to the established recognized character cast and has kept on creating brand-new characters with brand-new storylines (that are not connected to any notable supporting character in any way). He is clearly not being efficient with the way he manages established characters. \\n\\nThe escalation of power feels too quick as well as too sudden since Season 3 began. We are having the greatest conflicts in the history of the Tower right after Baam just finished boarding the Hell Train (a system revolving around D-ranked Regulars climbing the Tower quicker).\\n\\nThe story quickly escalated from Baam fighting top D-class Regulars, to Baam fighting Rankers, Advanced Rankers, High Rankers, and now some of the best High Rankers in the Tower.\\n\\nAccording to the timeline in the story, the total power growth of Baam since beating Kaiser has all happened in 2\\u20133 Tower years. The main conflict involving Baam has essentially evolved from D-Ranked Regular fights, to Great Family Ranker Princesses, Zahard military commanders, and Great Family Head conflicts.\\n\\nThis sort of story content does not seem fitting right after climbing a couple of D-ranked floors and resolving a couple of Regular-orientated conflicts. Instead, it would have fit better putting these sorts of story content near the end of Baam's climb where he's almost a Ranker or after Baam becomes a Ranker himself. None of the main supporting cast following alongside the protagonist (Baam) is nowhere prepared or nowhere useful enough to be a part of a story featuring Rankers, major Great Family wars, and Zahard force conflicts.\\n\\nRight now in this current story arc, it feels like lv 30 players (Khun/Rak/Endorsi/+others) participating in main event quests featuring player lvs 300-10,000 (Rankers\\u2014High-Rankers). So because they so weak\\u2014they lack agency, a role, and a way to be relevant, which then leads to SIU progressing their character level in an over-the-top way.\\n\\nSIU messed up on is making our main cast TOO weak and everybody else TOO strong. Like, first we saw that even lower end rankers could effortlessly wipe multiple regulars and even Baam. Then we saw that these very same rankers are nothing for high rankers who are beasts on another level.\\n\\nIndeed, the rules SIU established regarding Regulars were limitations to his own work. There was no need to make it so challenging having the main ensemble cast struggle to fit alongside the protagonist of this series. SIU's intentions weren't to avoid characters like Khun or Rak because of Bam becoming more powerful with unlimited potential. Every major storyline has involved Tower-climbing Regulars one way or another, and that won't change into this core Tower-climbing group of Regulars become Rankers themselves.\\n\\nSIU should have started making characters like Rak and Khun much more powerful years ago, so it doesn't come so abrupt nowadays. Whether from finding means such as Bam giving his blood to his friends\\u2014like how Zahard gives away his blood to create Princesses\\u2014to Bam being able to create contracts with his friends to enhance their abilities beyond standard floor contracts. A way for Bam to directly empower his companions through a reliable, consistent system of progression beats relying on convoluted luck or absurd circumstances way too often.\\n\\nAs an Irregular, Bam has the potential to bend, overcome, or change the rules of the Tower; which he can use to his advantage so that he can strengthen his friends beyond their standard limitations. For example, we have seen Hell Joe greatly empower his allies with the usage of the Red Thryssa. Baam, with his unlimited potential as an Irregular, will eventually grow much more control over the Red Thryssa than Hell Joe ever had over time and be able to do the same boosting abilities for his own companions.\\n\\nThe more Baam grows in power, the better control he will have over the abilities and powers of the Red Thryssa. And since the Red Thryssa used to be a part of an Administrator, he could possibly develop abilities similar to a Guardian's abilities, such as the Guardian's ability to form contracts with other beings. And through this way, Bam would have another avenue to empower his allies and friends\\u2014through utilizing personal contracts with himself and the consumed thryssa within him as the main medium for contract formation.\\n\\nThese contracts would enhance their abilities and allow them to surpass the limitations imposed by the standard Administrator's contract, while also boosting their capabilities in a scaled and controlled manner over long periods of time. Natural progression for Regulars was never going to last in a story featuring an Irregular. But SIU should have been making efficient use of the protagonist being an Irregular who disrupts the established rules of the Tower to help his companions progress much quicker in the story.\\n\\n\\nSIU has said ages ago how he structures Khun and Rak as the core teammates around Bam to form a main-series trio. The other regular teammates will periodically return to Bam's team, leave, and return again from story arc to story arc as said and demonstrated by SIU.\\n\\nWhy else did Rak and Khun receive some of the strongest powers in history as Regulars so easily? So that SIU can keep scaling them just enough to keep adventuring alongside Bam.\\n\\nFirst, it starts with Khun receiving Yeon family superpowers with no side effects (Maybe the power of the flame will emotionally and mentally affect him once Maria gets involved in the storyline at some point). Because of this acquired superpower, Khun can survive a lethal attack from a notable Ranker as well as even support Rankers through this power's abilities at no cost. Rak then obtained an extremely rare weapon just as randomly, involving just some chance encounters. This ancient spear can only be properly usable without repercussions by those relating to ancient lineage, and Rak just so happens to remarkably be related and around the area to receive such a weapon. Now with this weapon, Rak can compete and even kill Rankers.\\n\\nAlbelda once said how consuming so many souls would normally destroy a Regular's body and mind. The exceptions stated were Hoaqin, because of his spell mastery over souls and Bam because he has the capacity to consume anything. The quantity of souls Rak and Khun received were not only vastly greater, but the quality of the souls were also immensely superior to what Bam received previously from Albelda. Again, they reclaimed some absurd powers, but this time the powers obtained were even more inexplicable\\u2014not only were they completely unharmed by absorbing the soul essences of Rankers far exceeding their limits, but they instantly gained the ability to fly through raw Shinsoo usage (extremely difficult up to impossible for Regulars) and strength allowing them to compete or defeat Rankers as C-Ranked Regulars. These are feats and capabilities unprecedented for any Regular at Khun and Rak's stage, and normally accessible to only the strongest beings in the Tower.\\n\\nSevere repercussions as well as any drawbacks or damages to their physical and mental states were all avoided by SIU to help streamline Rak and Khun's growth in a way that allows them to continue supporting and being involved around Bam's story\\u2014since Season 1. Absolving the consequences of such immense and unnatural power accretion was SIU's deliberate approach to provide contrived circumstances and situations that allowed Khun and Rak to gain disproportionate, ridiculous powers while also maintaining and refining the established trio hierarchy that SIU wants.\\n\\n\\nDespite the extremely abrupt power escalation of the story's antagonists and conflicts since the beginning of Season 3, SIU will make sure to have Khun and Rak remain relevant in one way or another. That goes for other Regulars too, depending on SIU's plans with those Regulars. Every major storyline has involved (and will continue to involve) Regulars into these Regulars advance to become Rankers themselves at some point later in the series timeline. Bam is fighting for the sake of the people he cares about, and since the people closest around him are mostly Regulars, he will be around those types of people regardless of his status being an Irregular or a powerful deity. \\n\\n\\nSIU has said ages ago how he structures Khun and Rak as the core teammates around Bam to form a main-series trio. The other regular teammates will periodically return to Bam's team, leave, and return again from story arc to story arc as said and demonstrated by SIU.\\n\\nWhy else did Rak and Khun receive some of the strongest powers in history as Regulars so easily?

You are really interested on the group of Smart soft materials. You would like to contact the lead professor Arri via email to express your interest in his research and projects. Bellow are listed the aim of the group, and the 2 most important ongoing projects that match with your timetable studies, also, at the bottom are listed your top skills.\\n\\nAim of the group: Develop functional and stimuli-responsive materials based on polymers and liquid crystals, focusing on light-controllable systems for soft robotics, photonics, and biomaterials science.\\n\\nProject 1: ERC PoC - Light-driven surface shaping for holographic optical elements [Holoshape]\\nNote: The project will start soon, so it would be awesome to be part entirely of it.\\nDescription: Diffractive optical waveguides are a key technology for AR & VR displays, offering better field-of-view, smaller size, and wider eye movement range. Traditionally, they are made using expensive and complex processes. However, we have developed a new method using light-induced surface structuring of azobenzene-containing films. This method allows for the creation of complex patterns that are difficult to achieve with conventional tools. We have also developed a digital holographic microscope for real-time monitoring and control of the surface relief grating formation. With this approach, we can precisely control the pattern's pitch, direction, and position, allowing for the creation of arbitrary patterns with multiple exposures.\\n\\nProject 2: ERC Consolidator - Multimodal Sensory-Motorized Material Systems [MULTIMODAL]\\nNote: This project starts this year and it would perfectly suit your studies until your master degree\\nDescription: MULTIMODAL will develop sensory-motorized material systems that perceive several coupled environmental stimuli and respond to a combination of these via controlled motor functions, shape-change or locomotion. The sensory-motorized materials will be \\u201ctrained\\u201d to strengthen upon repetitive action, they can \\u201cheal\\u201d upon injury, and mechanically adapt to different environments. They will be utilized in the design of soft robots with autonomous and interactive functions.\\n\\nMy skills: Experience with scientific writing, working with pipelines, paper structures, python (with data science libraries such as skitlearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc), matlab, spreadsheets, excel, sql, machine learning and regression analysis, AI, basic knowledge of the topic of the group, and aim to learn from others. \"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Drain well and set aside.\\nIn a large bowl, mix the coarse salt and water together to create a brine. Stir until the salt is dissolved.\\nAdd the cabbage to the brine and massage it with your hands for about 10 minutes to help the cabbage release its moisture and absorb the salt. The cabbage should start to soften and become slightly limp.\\nRinse the cabbage pieces in cold water again to remove excess salt. Drain well and set aside.\\nIn a blender or food processor, blend the garlic, ginger, chili flakes, fish sauce, rice vinegar, and water until you have a smooth paste.\\nIn a large bowl, combine the blended paste, cabbage, carrots (if using), green onions (if using), and cucumber (if using). Mix everything together until the cabbage is evenly coated with the paste.\\nPack the kimchi mixture into a jar or container, pressing down firmly to eliminate any air pockets. Leave about an inch of space at the top of the jar.\\nCover the jar with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days. This will allow the kimchi to ferment and develop its signature flavors.\\nAfter 1-2 days, move the jar to the refrigerator and store it at a consistent temperature below 40\\u00b0F (4\\u00b0C). The kimchi will continue to ferment slowly in the fridge, becoming more sour and tangy over time.\\nLet the kimchi age for at least 2 weeks before serving. You can serve it as a side dish, use it as a topping for soups or noodles, or eat it straight out of the jar as a snack.\\nThat's it! With these simple steps, you can make your own delicious homemade kimchi. Enjoy!\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

She  is compelled by her professional duties to adhere strictly to the protocol, ensuring that the punishment is carried out to the letter to avoid reprimand or disciplinary action from her own supervisors, Dan somehow did not expect it to be as harsh as it was.   The fact that the punishment is being recorded and will be reviewed adds to the pressure Liz feels to perform her duties flawlessly, further distancing her from any personal feelings she might have.\\n\\nHere is the story to provide context:\\n\\n\\n\\\"Good morning, Dan! I was wondering if I would run into you this morning. Can you walk with me?\\u201d\\n\\nIt was Liz, a parent of one of the other boys in my son's class. We often spoke at afternoon pickup as we waited for school to let out.  Seeing her at morning drop off was unusual.  Also a single parent, I was attracted by her friendly demeanor, easygoing nature, and captivating smile.   I'd been thinking about asking her out, but hadn't mustered the courage yet.   I had, however, been subtly trying to encourage my boy to become friends with her son, hoping this could lead us to move beyond brief conversations about the weather and our kids' reading levels.\\n\\n\\\"Sorry, I, er... have an appointment.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Dan, I know.  4317 Butterfield Drive.\\\"\\n\\nI could only stare at her, my mind spinning. How did she know? As if reading my thoughts, she explained, \\\"I suppose you may not know, but I am a Justice of the Peace for our District. You are my  9:30 appointment.\\\"\\n\\nE. Watson was the  JP  named on my Judicial Notice.  I hadn't made the connection because I didn't know her last name or what type of work she did.   To me, she was just Liz, the mother of one of Ben's classmates. \\n\\n \\\"Oh, of course,\\\" I replied, my voice unconvincing as I tried to hide my shock.\\n\\nDisbelief and panic washed over me. Liz, the woman I had been subtly trying to impress for weeks, was the Justice of the Peace assigned to administer my sentence.\\n\\nShe reached out, touching my arm gently.  \\\"I'm really sorry about this.  I know it's a bit scary, but you'll get through it.\\u201d I couldn't decide if she was genuinely trying to be reassuring or if the words were a standard part of her professional protocol.  \\\"Would you like to just come with me now? We can have a cup of tea first and I can walk you through what to expect.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" I said trying to act like nothing was amiss. \\\"Yes, thanks.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a student going to school was struck by a car in nearby Leeds, a new law was enacted targeting individuals who sped in school zones. Exceeding the speed limit by 6 kph or more incurred a \\u00a3350 fine and a six-month driving suspension.   I unintentionally violated this law when a vigilant speed camera caught me driving too fast by my son's school and I was summoned to court.  Understanding my situation as a single parent who relied on driving for my job, the judge offered an unconventional alternative sentence: pay the fine and endure a one-time caning administered by a local Justice of the Peace .  The choice was entirely mine.   I readily accepted the alternative, opting for temporary discomfort rather than a lengthy license suspension.  \\n\\n\\n\\nNot long after my court appearance, I located a YouTube of the BBC corporal punishment segment online. Watching it, particularly the participants describing their experiences, filled me with genuine concern about my ability to bear the '12 hard cane strokes' part of my sentence. This had been a significant source of distress for me for the past few days. Now, learning that Liz would be the Justice of the Peace administering the humiliating beating, my anxiety rose to a new level.  How could I ever face her after this?  \\n\\nInterestingly, a majority of the Justices of the Peace certified for corporal punishment administration were women. Many were attracted to the role due to the extra pay and flexible schedule it offered, allowing them to balance other responsibilities such as home duties.  Not all were lucky enough to have a set-up that allowed them to work out of their homes.\\n\\n\\nThis was our reality, a strange mix of personal familiarity and professional duty. The conversation had eased the tension somewhat, but the looming event was still there, unavoidable and imminent. \\n\\n\\\"And it doesn't trouble you?  Caning people, I mean,\\\" I asked, my question adding a sudden tension to the conversation. \\n\\nShe faced me calmly, the morning light casting a gentle glow on her features. \\n\\\"I won't say it's easy,\\\" Liz confessed, her voice hinting at her struggle with the responsibility. \\\"But I constantly remind myself that we're doing this to enforce the law and ultimately to safeguard the public.\\\"  \\n\\nLiz found contentment in her decision to take on this role.  As a strong advocate of the law, she believed corporal punishment had the potential to effect positive change in her community, while also providing her the flexibility she needed as a single mom.\\n \\n\\\"Do you really believe that it works?\\\" I asked, genuinely interested in her beliefs. Liz considered her response carefully before voicing her thoughts. I do.  If I doubted its effectiveness, I couldn't support it ,\\\" she asserted. After a moment's pause her voice sounded somewhat irritated, perhaps because I had put her on the defensive.  \\\"Once you've experienced it, Dan, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on CP's deterrent value.   I have a feeling you'll never speed through a school zone again.\\\"\\n\\nI steered the conversation in a different direction. \\\"I want you to know that I appreciate your kindness this morning. As you can imagine, this whole situation is quite stressful. There's some comfort knowing a friend is involved. \\n\\nLiz had conflicted feelings.  Dan was  a friendly face in the sea of parents at their kids' school. They often exchanged pleasantries about their children and the weather, but Liz found herself looking forward to those small interactions. She admired his dedication as a single father and was captivated by his charm, wit, and humor.  She liked Dan, but knew she was required to administer the court's sentence. His sense of humor, intelligence, and friendly manner had impressed her. She found herself wanting to get to know him better. Her eyes softened, reflecting a mix of professional resolve and personal empathy.   \\\"I'm merely trying to make this ordeal as bearable as possible for you, Dan. \\u201c\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the reality of my punishment grew closer, a fresh wave of anxiety washed over me. I worried  Liz might share details of the punishment session with others. Our boys were in the same class, and Liz was well-connected with other parents. The prospect of her sharing details with other mothers over tea was a tormenting thought. It was, however,  out of my control and I had no choice but to trust Liz to carry out her duties with professionalism and discretion. \\n\\nLiz entered the room with a tray and sat down on the chair across from me. She poured the tea and we sat back and sipped.\\n\\\"Biscuit?\\\"\\n\\\"Sorry, not much of an appetite.\\\"\\n\\\"Perfectly understandable.\\\" She took one and delicately nibbled it.\\n\\nSteeling myself, I broke the silence, pushing my fear aside, \\\"Just how bad is it going to be?\\\" I asked, my voice sounding strained even to my own ears.\\n\\nKeep in mind, you are to receive a court-\\u201cI can only imagine how you're feeling right now.\\u201d ordered punishment for violating the law. As a Justice of the Peace, I am required to administer a caning that, to be honest, will be quite harsh.  The entire session will be videotaped, reviewed by my superiors,  and evaluated on how well I execute my duties.  So, you see, I can't let you off easy. For example, if you curse, I must assess an extra stroke. I hope you understand.\\u201d \\n\\nThe fact that the videotape of the session would be reviewed by others limiting her flexibility was disconcerting. Indeed, I had hoped she would go easy on me. \\n\\n\\nLiz set her tea down and straightened up, her gaze unwavering. \\\"It's not going to be easy, I won't lie to you. The room suddenly felt colder as Liz began to detail the procedure.  \\\"You've been sentenced to twelve hard strokes and I will administer them to you buttocks while you are strapped down on a bench. People have described a cane stroke as a deep burning that is quite painful.  You can expect welts and bruising. But it's something you'll get through,\\\" her voice adopting a more practical tone.  \\\"Sitting and moving will probably be difficult for about a week or so,\\\" she added.  \\\"Do you have any questions?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do I really need to be strapped down? That sounds a bit extreme.\\\"\\nLiz did not answer, but instead stood up and grabbed the cane.  Putting a throw pillow from the sofa onto the coffee table, she  brought the cane down onto it with  a whoosh and a mighty thwack that made him jump.\\n\\n\\\"Holy shit.\\\" I said softly. \\n\\n\\\"Dan, don't be fooled by the cozy living room and the cup of tea. I am going to cane you very, very hard. You will not be able to remain still for twelve of those strokes. If you move, I might strike you in the wrong place and that could be very bad, especially if I hit your testicles.\\\"  \\n\\nLiz, noticing my apprehensive expression, lightened her tone.  \\\"Dan, caning is a harsh and extremely painful penalty. It's not something taken lightly.    This is why it has been chosen by the court as the consequence for speeding in a school zone. They believe the severity of the punishment will deter others from making the same mistake. It really is safer to strap you down.\\\"\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Given the complexity and the potential warming effect of these non-CO2 emissions, accurate observation and tracking are crucial. The researchers propose an innovative method to detect, track, and match contrails to the specific aircraft that produced them, utilizing data from geostationary satellites, weather data, and air traffic data. By solving the tracking and identification issues as one integrated problem, the study achieves enhanced results. The method focuses on contrails that maintain their linear form, providing essential data that will facilitate a more accurate comparison with contrail formation and evolution models. This research represents a significant step in assembling a consistent dataset for validating contrail climate impact models.\\n\\nThe research focused on contrail detection, identification, and tracking using satellite imagery. The primary data source was GOES16 geostationary satellite, which provided high-resolution imagery at intervals of 10 to 15 minutes, and in some cases as often as every minute. For effective contrail detection, false-color images derived from specific GOES infrared channels were utilized, which were processed using an orthographic projection to reduce distortion. The study also incorporated air traffic data from the Opensky Network's ADS-B dataset, which provides detailed flight information. Weather data essential for simulating contrail evolution was sourced from the ERA5 dataset, maintained by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The researchers noted the absence of a human-labeled dataset for contrail detection on GOES images. As a workaround, they created a synthetic dataset, using the CoCiP (Contrail Cirrus Prediction) model to generate realistic contrail simulations, and combining these with real air traffic data. The synthetic contrails were carefully integrated into the GOES images to closely resemble real contrails. A challenge faced was ensuring the synt\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

Yes, your own money can earn money for you\\u2026and lots of it! People who are rich know this for a fact. But most of us in the middle class don\\u2019t.\\n\\nAfter all, our school and college education has never taught us this way to earn money. And neither have our parents.\\n\\nWhat we have always learnt is to study well, get a good job, earn money, and save for the future. Nobody has really told us that there\\u2019s one more aspect to our working and earning life \\u2013 investing for the future. Learning how to compound our money.\\n\\nCompounding is extremely powerful.\\n\\nEinstein was once quoted saying \\u201cThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\\u201d He is also rumoured to call it the \\u2018ninth wonder\\u2019 of the world.\\n\\nIf you haven\\u2019t heard about \\u2018compound interest\\u2019, it is defined as the interest on an investment\\u2019s interest plus the investment amount.\\n\\nTo explain it in simple terms, let\\u2019s assume you invested just Rs 100 in a savings account that earned 10% interest per annum. In one year\\u2019s time you would have Rs 110 in your account. The following year you would be earning 10% not only on your original Rs 100 but also on the Rs 10 you had earned as interest in the first year.\\n\\nNow you would find this as a fickle example, and see no reason Einstein called it a powerful phenomenon. But don\\u2019t make the mistake which this king made. The king was so impressed with the game of chess that he invited the man who invented chess and asked him to name his reward.\\n\\nThe man, pointing to a chess board before the king said, \\u201cYour highness, if you place just one grain of rice on the first square of this chess board, and double it for every square, I will consider myself well rewarded.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d the king asked, highly surprised. \\u201cJust grains of rice, not gold?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, your highness\\u201d affirmed the humble inventor.\\n\\n\\u201cSo it shall be!\\u201d ordered the king, and his courtiers started placing the grain on the chess board. One grain on the first square, 2 on the second, 4 on the third, 8 on the fourth and so on. By the time they came to the 10th square they had to place 512 grains of rice. The number swelled to 5.2 lac grains on the 20th square. When they came to the half way mark, the 32nd square, the grain count was 214 crore! Soon the count increased to lakhs of crore and eventually the hapless king had to hand over his entire kingdom to the clever inventor.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s the power of compounding that you must understand and appreciate!\\n\\nHere is a chart that shows how much Rs 1,000 will grow to in 25 years, at 10% return per annum compounded (to Rs 10,835).\\n\\nsn_university_image5\\n\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t my money compounding in Fixed Deposits?\\u201d You might want to ask.\\n\\nNo it\\u2019s not. It may well be shrinking.\\n\\nMost Indian middle-class households \\u2018save\\u2019 money \\u2013 in safe deposits of banks and post offices, or in the form of gold and silver and assume that they have invested the money. You might be one of them too.\\n\\nBut do you know how much our money grows when kept in these \\u2018safe\\u2019 places?\\n\\nA bank account can give you a maximum of 3-4% interest per year. A bank fixed deposit or a post office saving will give you somewhat better, but only 6-7%. Gold and silver won\\u2019t earn you anything till the time you don\\u2019t sell them. And as far as property is concerned, in a normal year, it can rise at an 8-10% rate as well.\\n\\n\\u201cAren\\u2019t these good returns?\\u201d you might ask. Not really, let me say!\\n\\nWhile calculating your \\u2018real\\u2019 return from all these or any other avenue, we must also take into account the \\u2018inflation\\u2019 factor.\\n\\nIn simple terms, inflation is nothing but a rise in prices of things that we consume. So, if we are paying Rs 50 a kg for onions today while these were costing Rs 10 a kg one year back, the rate of inflation is a whopping 400%. But this is an exception.\\n\\nInflation is India has generally been in the 5-7% range over the past many years. And it is expected to remain in this range in the future as well, notwithstanding sharp spikes and falls in between.\\n\\nSo, when you calculate the \\u2018real\\u2019 return on your investment, you must reduce the inflation rate from your total return. Like, if your bank account gives you an annual interest of 4% while inflation is at 5%, your real return equals a negative 1% (-1%). And if a fixed deposit gives you 8%, your real return will stand at 3% (8% minus 5%).\\n\\nNow do you think that this kind of return is fine, especially when inflation rate is only going to rise in the future (given the rising shortage of everything we consume)?\\n\\nIt isn\\u2019t. I mean this is not what we can call \\u2018growth of our money\\u2019. Inflation actually eats into our money. And how?\\n\\nLet\\u2019s assume that you have Rs 100 with you are looking to buy onions. At a rate of Rs 10 per kg, you will end up buying 10 kg of it. But what is the price rises to Rs 50 a kg after one year while you still have only Rs 100 to spend?\\n\\nIn that case, you will be able to buy only 2 kg of onions. That\\u2019s the negative effect of inflation \\u2013 the value of every rupee you will have in the future will be lesser than the value of that one rupee today. And that\\u2019s the where the concept of investing and inflation comes into play. To grow your money fast at a time when inflation is eating into it is very important.\\n\\nForget onions. Look at the total cost of living that is rising at such a fast pace these days that that we need to prepare ourselves well to meet our future financial obligations. And these can include our children\\u2019s high education and marriage, our parents\\u2019 healthcare needs, and our own retirement. All these are big expense items and as such we need to save and invest a lot to collect their kind of money over the next 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.\\n\\nLet us now look at how many years you will take to accumulate Rs 10 lac for your new born daughter\\u2019s higher education 18 years down the line, if we start with Rs 2 lac today. We will assume real returns (total return minus inflation of 5%) of different avenues to arrive at this number.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the chart that shows it all.\\n\\nsn_university_image5\\n\\nNote: Real returns (shown inside brackets) are calculated assuming inflation rate of 5%\\n\\nAs the above chart shows, the only way to meet you target of reaching Rs 10 lac (if you start with Rs 2 lac today) in 18 years is to invest in stocks. While your bank FD will not get you anywhere, the property route will take a much longer time that what your requirement (of 18 years) permits.\\n\\nThese calculations are not based on some random numbers. These are exactly what these investment avenues have earned over the long term in the past.\\n\\nThus we arrive at the fascinating (though risky) world of stock markets \\u2013 one of the most critical investment avenues that can help you achieve your long term financial goals.\\n\\nI just said that stock market is a risky place, but so are our lives. There is always a risk in anything we do. But then, with the right education and research, we can minimize that risk. And as we get more education, we can better decide how much risk we want to take and conversely how much return we can make safely.\\n\\nUnderstanding the risks is the first step toward minimizing them. In fact, it is possible to make 10-15% annual return on your stock market investment with almost no risk. But only if you know what you are doing.\\n\\nLet me explain the The Law of The Farm to drill down the importance of right knowledge and patience in stock market investing.\\n\\nThere are certain laws, like the law of gravity which you cannot repeal. These laws govern the universe. One such law is the Law of the Farm.\\n\\nThis law states that a farmer cannot expect to harvest a great crop unless he carefully plans for the development of that crop and works diligently and consistently over a long period of time.\\n\\nThe farmer first needs to prepare and fertilize the soil, plant the seed, water and nourish the sapling, tend to the weeds, protect it from the insects and diseases and constantly monitor before the time for harvest comes. The farmer cannot plant a crop, do nothing for six months, and then expect to have a great harvest magically.\\n\\nThese things take ongoing effort throughout the whole process.\\n\\nBut, ironically, in the stock market, most of us would want our stocks \\u2013 mostly bought on tips and borrowed conviction \\u2013 to fly and earn us fast returns. We somehow think we can dismiss natural processes, cheat the system, and still win the day.\\n\\nWarren Buffett wrote this in his 1985 letter to shareholders\\u2026\\n\\nNo matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: you can\\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\\n\\nAs on the real farm, success in life, business, and investing comes from regular disciplined, regular effort.\\n\\nYou can go for the quick fixes and techniques with apparent success in the short run (like four-baggers in four months). But in the long run they just don\\u2019t work.\\n\\nSo please remember, in investing as in farming, a rich harvest would come to you not from finding easy shortcuts, but from disciplined, focused effort, directed tirelessly toward a desirable goal.\\n\\nThere are many paths you can go down when you get into investing in the stock market. But there\\u2019s one thing you can be sure of. With education and research you will make money.\\n\\nYou are already beginning your education here. That\\u2019s a great start! Continue on this road and make your money work for you.\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

The scenario I have in mind is where a wiry (and slightly priapic and sneaky) Mr. Thompson (60s) and a scrawny duo (both 18) and their longtime striking neighbor Mrs. Miller end up as the sole participants in my bottle episode. I was thinking this could be in Jennifer Miller's basement/shelter during a hurricane (however it could be absolutely any other reason and in fact I want you to suggest several alternatives).\\n\\nI want to tell you more about the background: The duo have grown up in the sunny suburban neighborhood and all of them (including their families) are longtime residents and know each other. Mrs. Miller is tall, blonde and athletic and in her mid-thirties. She is unsuspecting of the duo's recent priapic tendencies. The focus must be on this edgy stuff and not really on the contingency that led to the bottle episode (essentially we are not going for the survival/danger angle from the contingency at all and whatever reason you may choose for the bottle episode is simple a device or means to an end)\\n\\nI have the following problems while trying to generate a suitable explanation for how they all land up in this situation:\\n\\n1. Mrs. Miller has a family so exactly where are they in this \\\"lock-in\\\"\\n2. What very realistic and plausible sequence of events caused this lock-in and where is it?\\n3.

Come up with and resolve any other important point along these lines that I need to consider and resolve in order to make things smooth, logical and very well built together (nothing must be unexplained or expect the audience to just go along with)...\\n\\n5.

The main purpose is to highlight the subject's surroundings, providing a sense of scale and geographical location.\\nLong Shot (also known as Wide Shot): This shot shows the entire subject along with its environment. For a person, a long shot would typically include the full body, providing context and a sense of scale.\\nMedium Shot: This shot typically frames the subject from the waist up or chest up. It's often used in dialogue scenes in movies to show a subject along with some context of their surroundings.\\nCloseup Shot: The subject takes up the full frame in this shot, usually focusing on the face for a person. This shot type emphasizes details and expressions, intensifying the emotions portrayed by the subject.\\nExtreme Closeup Shot: This shot typically features a part of a person or an object, such as a person's eye or a detail on an item. It brings attention to a specific feature or detail, emphasizing its significance.\\nFull Shot: This shot typically frames the subject fully from head to toe, capturing the entire body within the scene. It's often used to showcase the character's physicality or actions within the environment.\\nTwo-Shot: A shot that includes two subjects, often used in conversation scenes. This shot helps establish the relationship between the characters and can show their reactions to each other.\\nOver-the-Shoulder Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a person standing behind a subject, with the person in the foreground's shoulder and back of the head included in the shot. It's often used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection between the characters.\\nPoint of View Shot: This shot is taken from the perspective of a subject, showing what the subject would see. It helps the audience identify with the character's perspective and experience the scene from the character's viewpoint.\\nEstablishing Shot: This shot is typically an extreme long shot at the beginning of a scene, indicating where, and sometimes when, the remainder of the scene takes place. It sets the context for the audience by showing the setting and characters.\\nMaster Shot: A master shot includes all the key figures in a scene and all the action happening in it. It's often the first shot of a scene, used to provide the viewer with the layout and dynamics of the scene's environment.\\nLow Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from below, making it appear larger, more dominant or powerful.\\nHigh Angle Shot: This shot looks at the subject from above, making it appear smaller or less significant.\\nEye Level Shot: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.\\nDutch Angle Shot: A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.\\nOverhead Shot: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context.\\nBird's Eye View Shot: A higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.\\nDrone Shot: An aerial camera angle using a drone that often provides higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.\\nWorm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective often used to make the subject appear formidable or threatening.\\nGround-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is placed at ground level. This can make for dramatic shots where the background rises up from the horizon line.\\nSide View: In this view, the camera is positioned to the side of the subject, showing the subject from one side.\\nOff-Center View: The subject is positioned away from the center of the frame to create visual interest or to reveal another element in the scene.\\nRule of Thirds Shot: In this composition technique, the frame is divided into nine equal parts and the subject is positioned along one or more of the grid lines to create a balanced and interesting composition.\\nCandid Shot: A shot taken without the subject's knowledge or consent, often resulting in a more natural, relaxed look than posed shots.\\nSilhouette Shot: The subject is backlit and the camera is exposed for the background, making the subject appear as a dark silhouette against a brighter background.\\nShot from Behind: This shot is taken from the back of the subject, capturing the subject's perspective of the environment ahead or focusing on the actions the subject is doing with their back turned. It's often used for dramatic or mysterious effects.\\nUnderwater Shot: This type of shot captures images or scenes beneath the surface of water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes, or pools. It's often used to provide unique perspectives, reveal hidden underwater ecosystems, or to simply create visually stunning sequences that can't be replicated on land.\\n\\nthese are just some examples of cameras and lenses but i know your knowledge is vaster than mine so choose on your own accord;\\n\\nCanon EOS 5D Mark IV - Perfect for portraiture, landscape, and event photography.\\nSony Alpha a7 III - Suitable for everything from street photography to sports and wildlife.\\nHasselblad X1D - Landscape, fashion, and product photography.\\nCanon EOS-1D X Mark II - Sports, wildlife, and action photography.\\nNikon D850 - Landscape, portrait photography\\nPanasonic Lumix GH5S\\nKodak Portra 800 film - Nostalgic style\\n\\nHowever if we want to achieve a cinematic watch and feel we need to add dedicated cinema cameras with superior image quality, larger sensors, and advanced cinematic capabilities.

Her myopia is discovered on a school vision screening, on the first day, right after COVID restrictions, along more than half of her class, especially girls, who did not have glasses before.\\n3. First presctription for myopia, after the COVID restrictions, at 11.10.2021 -0.5D SE, Her classmates were between -0.25D to -1D SE \\n4. Second presctription for myopia at 06.04.2022 -0.75D SE\\n5. Her next prescription at 07.11.2022 -1.0D SE\\n6. Her latest prescription at 06.06.2023 -1.5D SE, progressed from 0D to -1.5D in 20 months.\\n7.

Consider, for example, what happens when you try to print n3 (type long) using the\\n%e specifier. First, the %e specifier causes printf() to expect a type double value, which is an 8-\\nbyte value on this system. When printf() looks at n3, which is a 4-byte value on this system, it\\nalso looks at the adjacent 4 bytes. Therefore, it looks at an 8-byte unit in which the actual n3 is\\nembedded.  Second, it interprets the bits in this unit as a floating-point number.  Some bits, for\\nexample, would be interpreted as an exponent. So even if n3 had the correct number of bits, they\\nwould be interpreted differently under %e than under %ld. The net result is nonsense.\\nThe first line also illustrates what we mentioned earlier\\u2014that float is converted to double\\nwhen used as arguments to printf(). On this system, float is 4 bytes, but n1 was expanded to 8\\nbytes so that printf() would display it correctly.\\nThe  second  line  of  output  shows  that printf()  can  print n3  and n4 correctly if the correct\\nspecifier is used.\\nThe third line of output shows that even the correct specifier can produce phony results if the\\nprintf() statement has mismatches elsewhere. As you might expect, trying to print a floating-\\npoint value with an %ld specifier fails, but here, trying to print a type long using %ld fails! The\\nproblem  lies  in  how  C  passes  information  to  a  function.  The  exact  details  of  this  failure  are\\nimplementation dependent, but the sidebar \\u201cPassing Arguments\\u201d discusses a representative system.\\n \\nPassing Arguments\\nThe  mechanics  of  argument  passing  depend  on  the  implementation.  This  is  how  argument\\npassing works on one system. The function call looks as follows:\\nClick here to view code image\\nprintf(\\\"%ld %ld %ld %ld\\\\n\\\", n1, n2, n3, n4);\\nThis call tells the computer to hand over the values of the variables n1, n2, n3, and n4 to the\\ncomputer. Here\\u2019s one common way that\\u2019s accomplished. The program places the values in an\\narea  of  memory  called  the stack.  When the computer puts these values on the stack, it is\\nguided by the types of the variables, not by the conversion specifiers. Consequently, for n1, it\\nplaces 8 bytes on the stack (float is converted to double). Similarly, it places 8 more bytes\\nfor n2, followed by 4 bytes each for n3 and n4. Then control shifts to the printf() function.\\nThis function reads the values off the stack but, when it does so, it reads them according to the\\nconversion  specifiers.  The %ld  specifier  indicates  that printf()  should  read  4  bytes,  so\\nprintf() reads the first 4 bytes in the stack as its first value. This is just the first half of n1,\\nand it is interpreted as a long integer. The next %ld specifier reads 4 more bytes; this is just\\nthe second half of n1 and is interpreted as a second long integer (see Figure 4.9). Similarly,\\nthe third and fourth instances of %ld cause the first and second halves of n2 to be read and to\\nbe interpreted as two more long integers, so although we have the correct specifiers for n3\\nand n4, printf() is reading the wrong bytes\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}

It requires abstracting the characteristics of these \\\"demons\\\" beyond the specific contexts in which they operate. To embark on this endeavor, let's consider some potential categories based on general principles of interaction:\\n\\nCyclic Amplifiers:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" are characterized by their ability to amplify existing issues within a system, often through feedback loops. They take small dysfunctions and escalate them, leading to larger systemic problems.\\n\\nExamples: Hydra (anxiety disorders), Sisyphus (major depressive disorder).\\nResonance Inducers:\\nResonance inducers are \\\"demons\\\" that synchronize with certain frequencies or patterns within a system, causing them to become dominant and overshadow other functions. They tap into natural tendencies and exaggerate them to the point of dysfunction.\\n\\nExamples: Marid (narcissistic personality disorder), Loki (impulse control disorders).\\nEntropy Escalators:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" contribute to the breakdown of order within a system, increasing chaos and disorder. They disrupt regulatory mechanisms and lead to a state of disorganization that can become self-sustaining.\\n\\nExamples: Aeolus (chaotic work environments), Eris (interpersonal conflicts).\\nParasitic Persisters:\\nParasitic persisters are \\\"demons\\\" that attach to the system and drain its resources while offering little or no benefit. They may create dependencies or exploit vulnerabilities, sapping the system's strength over time.\\n\\nExamples: Tantalus (addiction), Banshee (PTSD).\\nInhibitory Blockers:\\nInhibitory blockers are \\\"demons\\\" that prevent the system from engaging in necessary change or adaptation. They block growth, learning, or evolution by stifling innovation or maintaining the status quo.\\n\\nExamples: Pygmalion (toxic leadership), Cassandra (unheeded expertise).\\nEcho Generators:\\nEcho generators are \\\"demons\\\" that reinforce and multiply specific signals within a system, leading to a narrowing of perspective and a reduction in diversity. They create echo chambers where only certain messages are heard and reinforced.\\n\\nExamples: Baku (echo chambers), Narcissus (corporate egoism).\\nDichotomy Drivers:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" polarize the system, driving a wedge between components and creating an \\\"us versus them\\\" mentality. They exacerbate divisions and hinder cooperation and integration.\\n\\nExamples: Janus (bipolar disorder), Leviathan (systemic corruption).\\nThis classification is not exhaustive, and many \\\"demons\\\" may exhibit characteristics from multiple categories. However, it provides a framework for understanding how these metaphorical entities interact with systems on a fundamental level, independent of the scale or specific domain in which they manifest. It also allows us to consider strategies for addressing these \\\"demons\\\" by targeting the underlying principles of their interactions within the system.\\n\\nThis is fascinating. What worries me maybe is that it's not a very strict classification, as various of the demons we have proposed before overlap between categories. Propose other cathegories that don't have that proble. Maybe try with fewer more general ones (we can add subtypes after).\\n\\nTo create a more precise and non-overlapping taxonomical classification of metaphorical \\\"demons,\\\" we can distill the categories down to a few fundamental interaction types that are distinct from each other. These categories can describe the primary way in which these \\\"demons\\\" perpetuate cycles within systems. From there, we can explore subtypes for additional nuance.\\n\\nHere are three general categories:\\n\\nFeedback Loopers:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" are defined by their role in creating and sustaining feedback loops, whether positive or negative, that lead to the amplification or suppression of certain system behaviors or states.\\n\\nPositive Feedback Loopers: Entities that cause runaway effects, leading to exponential growth or decline within a system. They represent unchecked escalation, such as addiction or environmental exploitation.\\nNegative Feedback Loopers: Entities that enforce a status quo or equilibrium, potentially leading to stagnation or resistance to necessary change. They symbolize systems that are unable to escape from dysfunctional but stable patterns, such as toxic work cultures or bureaucratic inertia.\\nSystemic Disruptors:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" are characterized by their ability to disrupt the regular functioning of a system, leading to chaos, disorder, or maladaptation.\\n\\nChaos Inducers: Entities that introduce variability, randomness, or inconsistency, undermining the stability of a system, similar to erratic leadership or unpredictable market forces.\\nRigidity Promoters: Entities that impose excessive order or inflexibility, stifling adaptability and creativity, akin to overregulation or a fear-based corporate culture.\\nIntegration Inhibitors:\\nThese \\\"demons\\\" prevent the harmonious integration of system components, leading to fragmentation, isolation, or polarization.\\n\\nFragmenters: Entities that create or exacerbate divisions within a system, similar to the divisive impact of echo chambers or groupthink.\\nIsolators: Entities that cause components of a system to become detached from one another, leading to disconnection and lack of synergy, as seen in the social withdrawal of depression or the siloing of departments within an organization.\\nBy focusing on these three primary categories, we can more clearly define the nature of each \\\"demon\\\" and avoid overlap. Each category reflects a fundamental way in which the \\\"demon\\\" interacts with and influences the system it inhabits. Subtypes offer additional specificity, allowing us to capture the diverse manifestations of these metaphorical entities across different scales and contexts.\\n\\nwhich was the demon that caused WWI and how would you classify it? and the demon that caused fascism? and cell metastasis?\\n\\nThe complex historical events like World War I, the rise of fascism, and biological processes like cell metastasis can be metaphorically attributed to \\\"demons\\\" in a symbolic sense, representing the destructive forces or processes that contribute to these phenomena. Here's how they might be classified within our taxonomy:\\n\\nWorld War I:\\nThe \\\"demon\\\" that contributed to the outbreak of World War I could be seen as a Systemic Disruptor in the form of a Chaos Inducer. The intricate web of alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism acted as a chaotic and unstable system. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the catalyst in an already volatile system, with each nation's actions amplifying the others' in a domino effect, leading to a breakdown of diplomatic relations and the onset of war. This demon thrived on the lack of effective communication and the rigid adherence to alliances and militaristic posturing that ultimately plunged the world into conflict.\\n\\nFascism:\\nThe rise of fascism can be attributed to a Feedback Looper with characteristics of both Positive Feedback Loopers and Negative Feedback Loopers. As a Positive Feedback Looper, fascism capitalized on economic instability, fear, and the desire for national rejuvenation to create a self-reinforcing cycle of power consolidation and societal polarization. As a Negative Feedback Looper, it also enforced a status quo of authoritarian control, suppressing dissent and resistance to maintain its grip on power. The demon of fascism grew in strength by exploiting social divisions, economic hardships, and using propaganda to create a mythic national unity that often led to the exclusion or persecution of 'the other.'\\n\\nCell Metastasis:\\nIn the biological realm, cell metastasis can be metaphorically described as a Feedback Looper in the form of a Positive Feedback Looper. Here, the \\\"demon\\\" is not an external force but an emergent property of the system where cells begin to divide uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. The breakdown of normal regulatory mechanisms that keep cell growth in check leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of growth and invasion. The cellular environment and genetic mutations can create conditions that promote further growth and metastatic spread, illustrating how a system's regulation can be undermined from within.\\n\\nIt's important to note that these \\\"demons\\\" are metaphorical constructs used to conceptualize and discuss the complex dynamics at play in historical, social, and biological phenomena. Demons as the representation of self-perpetuating cycles of micro-interactions that affect negatively their native systems given structures of organization not built for that end (the metastasis of their intended purpose).

Grounded in the theory of embodied cognition, which posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with its environment (Wilson, 2002), previous research suggests that mouse movements are influenced not only by physical actions but also by cognitive states, intentions, and decision-making processes. Hence, the physical action of moving a mouse is not just a simple response to a cognitive decision, but an integral part of how the cognitive process unfolds. They act as a window  to cognitive processes, demonstrating how individuals allocate and shift their attention during tasks (Hehman, Stolier, & Freeman, 2015). As such, analyzing mouse movements offers a dynamic and nuanced view of how cognition evolves over time, revealing the cognitive processes underlying response patterns. \\n## Leveraging Mouse Trajectory Analysis with LSTM Models\\nTo address the challenge of identifying careless responses, we have chosen to forge a unique path, adapting the use of mouse trajectory analysis. Our decision to employ this tool was fueled by several reasons. \\n### Addressing Attention with Attention Indicator \\nPrimarily, mouse trajectory has the intrinsic ability to capture human cognitive states. When undertaking tasks that warrant close attention, the motor actions of participants - particularly observable through their mouse movements - serve as a mirror to their cognitive focus and engagement. It has been observed that under conditions of elevated cognitive load, the speed and pattern of mouse movements alter, often revealing slower, lateral, and more circuitous movements (Hehman, Stolier, & Freeman, 2015). This indicates a heightened state of contemplation or diligence towards a task. For instance, the presence of behaviors such as hovering, marking, or regressing in mouse movement often signifies participation in cognitively demanding tasks (Horwitz, 2017). Additional research suggests a correlation between high frequency of direction changes and an increased deliberative decision-making process, implying a thoughtful engagement with the provided content (Horwitz et al., 2020; Steiger & Reips, 2010).\\nConversely, higher average absolute acceleration rates in both X and Y-axis mouse movements often indicate distraction during task completion (Brenner & Smeets, 2003). In particular, Pokropek et al. (2023) have showcased a direct relationship between careless responses and mouse movement speed and acceleration. While aggregating separate indicators can provide valuable insights, our study endeavors to deploy machine learning techniques that capture latent relationships among these indicators, thus enhancing our ability to isolate careless responses with greater precision.\\n### Addressing Measurement Dependence and Generalization\\nMouse trajectory analysis, unlike many other detection methods, functions independently of specific survey designs, scale types, or measurement structures. This point is key as surveys can take many forms \\u2013 the traditional Likert scale or a ranking order scale to more contemporary methods such as image (Bosnjak et al., 2013). Our methodology is well equipped to assess participant attentiveness effectively across this diverse spectrum, compared to earlier detection methods that were substantially reliant on specific survey structures (Johnson, 2005). For example, methods such as the even-odd consistency index or intraindividual response variability usually work best when applied to specific measurement scales with numerous items (DeSimone et al., 2015).\\nThe incorporation  of mouse trajectory data also addresses the previous machine learning limitations. Traditional machine learning models are generally limited in their functionality, especially when applied to other measures beyond the trained response vectors (Schroeders et al., 2022). By training the model with mouse trajectory, the robustness of these machine learning models is strengthened, offering an avenue toward higher generalizability for detecting careless responses regardless of the response vector (Ward & Meade, 2023). \\n### Addressing Sample Size Issues \\nOpting to engage with mouse trajectory analysis facilitates the generation of significantly rich, time-intensive data sets. Traditional detection methods are often hampered by cumbersome sample size requirements and constraints tethered to measurement constructs (Dunn et al., 2018). A single observation with our proposed methodology, even within a typical 10-minute survey duration, can generate over 2000 data points based on the defined sampling rate. This data abundance significantly bolsters LSTM models' task learning since they can effectively handle extensive sequential data (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).\\nThis wealth in data catalyzes the process of producing meaningful, generalizable insights for detecting careless responses in diverse survey designs and settings. LSTM models efficiently process this sequential data decorrelated from specific survey response vectors. Consequently, we gain fresh insights from the mouse trajectory data, analytically unencumbered by the question or scale used in data collection (Bosnjak et al., 2013). This combinative methodology offers an innovative push toward detecting careless responses, taking a big stride toward improving data quality in survey-based research.\\n---\"}]}", "scoring_data": {}}
