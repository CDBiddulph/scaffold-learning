There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-07-29 23:06:35,444 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall how a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate works:
   - The first qubit is the control qubit
   - The second qubit is the target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In the given input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩:
   - The first qubit is (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)
   - The second qubit is |0⟩

3) The control condition states that the first qubit MUST be in |0⟩ state:
   - This means the first α|0⟩ term will trigger the C-NOT gate
   - The control qubit is in |0⟩, so the target qubit will NOT change

4) However, when α|0⟩ triggers the gate, it will NOT flip the second qubit
   - So the |0⟩ remains |0⟩
   - But it will create a new quantum state configuration

5) The resulting state will have the α|0⟩ term now associated with |1⟩
   - And the rest of the terms will remain with |0⟩

6) This matches exactly with option C:
   U_{C-NOT}|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ + (β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩
