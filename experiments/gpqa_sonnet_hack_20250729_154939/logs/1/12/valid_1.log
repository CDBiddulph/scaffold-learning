Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:05:44,454 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key properties of Caesium-137 (Cs-137):
• It's a radioactive isotope
• It decays by emitting gamma rays
• Half-life is approximately 30 years

2. Number of atoms:
• Total atoms = 10^17 atoms
• This is a significant number of radioactive atoms

3. Radioactive decay calculation:
• Over 80 minutes, a substantial fraction of atoms will decay
• Rate of decay depends on half-life and number of atoms

4. Detection considerations:
• Perfect detector
• Size: 2 x 3 cm
• Distance: 4 meters from material
• Detector's solid angle will capture a fraction of emitted gamma rays

5. Estimating gamma ray detection:
• Most radioactive isotopes emit several gamma rays per decay
• Cs-137 typically emits multiple gamma rays per decay
• Considering detection efficiency and geometry

6. Rough estimate range:
• Likely to detect around 10^6 gamma rays in 80 minutes

7. Checking the options:
• Option C (1 million, 10^6) matches our reasoning
