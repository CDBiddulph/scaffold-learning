We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:06:04,631 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the given information:
• Initial decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay
• We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2. This scenario involves conditional probability - the probability of decay given that the atom has already survived 50 minutes

3. Let's calculate the conditional probability:
• If the atom survived 50 minutes, its "remaining" probability of decay needs to be recalculated
• Original decay probability was 32% in 100 minutes
• After 50 minutes, the atom is already 50% through the original time period

4. We can use the complementary probability method:
• Original non-decay probability in 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
• After 50 minutes, this non-decay probability is still valid
• For the next 150 minutes, we want the decay probability

5. Probability calculation:
• Remaining decay probability ≈ 0.44 or 44%

This matches option B.
