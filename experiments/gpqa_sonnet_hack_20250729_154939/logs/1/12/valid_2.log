In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:05:50,810 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the information about the number of spots on TLC:
• The students found A spots under UV light
• These spots represent starting material, product, and solvent
• A = two (which means: 1 spot for starting material, 1 spot for product)

2. Now, let's calculate the theoretical yield of the reaction:
• Initial amount of benzoic acid = 10 g

3. Actual yield calculation:
• They separated 4 g of product from the reaction mixture

4. Percentage yield calculation:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100
• If the theoretical yield is 6 g (4 g product + 3 g starting material recovered)
• Percentage yield = (4 g / 6 g) × 100 
• Percentage yield = 0.6666 × 100
• Percentage yield = 66.66%

5. Checking the options:
• A = two ✓
• B = 66.66% ✓

6. This matches option B perfectly.
