2025-07-29 23:06:48,093 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the molecular structure of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid:
   • The molecule has a cyclohexene ring
   • It has a formyl group (-CHO)
   • It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2)
   • It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

2) When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations will occur:
   • The vinyl group will be reduced to an ethyl group
   • The formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group
   • The carboxylic acid group will be reduced to a methyl group
   • The double bond in the ring will be reduced to a single bond

3) To calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), we count the number of rings and double bonds:
   • After reduction, the molecule will have no rings
   • After reduction, the molecule will have no double bonds

4) The index of hydrogen deficiency is 1
   • This means the molecule has one fewer hydrogen atom than a fully saturated molecule

5) Therefore, the answer is 1
