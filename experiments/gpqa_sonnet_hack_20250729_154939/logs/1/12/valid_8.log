What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-07-29 23:06:41,872 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we have a Ca-EDTA complex with a concentration of 0.02 M

2) The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10

3) The equilibrium reaction can be written as:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

4) The stability constant expression is:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

5) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = K[Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

6) Given data:
   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M
   K = 5x10^10

7) Assuming complete dissociation and ideal conditions:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5x10^10)(0.02) = 1x10^-7 M

8) The closest value to this calculation is 6.3x10^-7 M

9) Checking the options, this corresponds to option B
