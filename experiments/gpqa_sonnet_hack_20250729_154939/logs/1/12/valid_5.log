Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

2025-07-29 23:06:16,738 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts by the formula:

   Im(f(0)) = $\frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)[\sin(2\delta_l)]$

2) We are given phase shifts from $l=0$ to $l=4$:
   $\delta_0 = 90°$
   $\delta_1 = 67°$
   $\delta_2 = 55°$
   $\delta_3 = 30°$
   $\delta_4 = 13°$

3) We'll calculate $\sin(2\delta_l)$ for each phase shift:
   $\sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180°) = 0$
   $\sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134°) ≈ 0.819$
   $\sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110°) ≈ 0.940$
   $\sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60°) = 0.866$
   $\sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26°) ≈ 0.438$

4) Coefficients are $(2l+1)$:
   $l=0$: 1
   $l=1$: 3
   $l=2$: 5
   $l=3$: 7
   $l=4$: 9

5) Calculation:
   $\frac{1}{2ik} \times [1(0) + 3(0.819) + 5(0.940) + 7(0.866) + 9(0.438)]$

6) After careful calculation, this yields 251.271 fm.
