d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b

2025-07-29 23:05:58,233 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what determines a planet's density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• For a spherical planet, density depends on mass and radius

2. Case a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
• Same as Earth's standard density (about 5.5 g/cm³)
• No change in density

3. Case b (2 Earth masses, unspecified details):
• Not enough information to definitively determine density
• Cannot conclusively evaluate

4. Case c (Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive):
• Composition is the same, which means material density remains constant
• Increased mass would require larger radius proportionally
• Density would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm³
• Same composition means proportional increase in mass and volume

5. Case d (Same composition, half Earth's mass):
• Smaller mass would likely mean smaller radius
• Density would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparing the options:
• Case c stands out because it maintains Earth-like composition
• No change in fundamental density characteristics

Answer: A

Reasoning: The planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive maintains the same density while being the most massive option.
