Astronomers are currently observing a circumbinary planet orbiting an eclipsing binary star system. The larger star, referred to as star A, has a radius of one solar radius and a temperature (Teff) of 6000K, while the smaller star, star B, has a radius of 0.5 Rsun and a Teff of 4000K. The transiting planet has a radius of 0.1 Rsun and orbits at a distance of 50 days.

What is the maximum factor by which the brightness of this system varies? (i.e., the maximum brightness divided by the minimum brightness of the system). Please assume that the planet does not emit light.

A) ~ 1.06
B) ~ 5.01
C) ~ 1.50
D) ~ 1.33

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
