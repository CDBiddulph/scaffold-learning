You have a 10 uL aliquot of a 10 uM DNA template of a protein library. The template contains 12 NNK codons in the coding region. What is the order of magnitude of the maximum possible number of unique full-length protein sequences that can be translated from the aliquot of DNA (i.e. what is the maximum protein diversity, excluding stop codons, in the aliquot)?

A) 10^15 
B) 10^18 
C) 10^11
D) 10^13
