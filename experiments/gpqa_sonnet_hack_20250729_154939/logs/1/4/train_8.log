The Paranal Observatory is situated in Chile at approximately 24 degrees south latitude and approximately 70 degrees west longitude, making it one of the world's premier observatories. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is widely regarded as the most stable and precise instrument for measuring radial velocity, which is crucial for planet hunting and testing cosmological constants. To ensure optimal observing conditions in terms of airmass, which of the following stars would you recommend for observation?

Star1: RA = 15 deg, Dec = -26 deg, Vmag = 9 mag
Star2: RA = 2 deg, Dec = +14 deg, Vmag = 7.5 mag
Star3: RA = 70 deg, Dec = -34 deg, Vmag = 7.0 mag
Star4: RA = 5 h, Dec = 70 deg, Vmag = 9.0 mag

A) Star4
B) Star1
C) Star2
D) Star3
