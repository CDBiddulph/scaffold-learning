Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. A planet's density depends on its composition and compactness.

2. Option a) suggests an Earth-like planet in size and mass, which would have Earth's standard density of about 5.5 g/cmÂ³.

3. Option b) has 2 Earth masses but the same density as Earth, suggesting a proportional increase.

4. Option c) has 5 times Earth's mass with the same composition. As mass increases, gravitational compression would likely increase the planet's density.

5. Planetary physics shows that as mass increases, gravitational compression causes a planet to become more compact. This means:
- More mass under the same composition leads to higher density
- The core becomes more compressed
- Material gets packed more tightly

6. A planet with 5 times Earth's mass would experience significant gravitational compression, leading to a higher density than a planet of Earth's mass.

7. Comparing the densities, option c) would have the highest density due to gravitational compression.
