Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand Caesium-137 decay:
- Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
- Each atom emits gamma rays at a specific decay rate

2. Calculate number of decays per minute:
- Total atoms: 10^17
- Most atoms will be decaying during this 80-minute period
- Approximately 10^17 × (decay probability per atom per minute)

3. Detector considerations:
- Size: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
- Distance: 4 meters
- Detector's solid angle and capture efficiency will reduce detected rays

4. Rough gamma ray detection estimate:
- At this timeframe and atom count, likely in the range of 10^6 gamma rays
- Accounting for detector geometry and distance

5. Checking the options:
- 10^4 (A) seems too low
- 10^8 (B) seems too high
- 10^6 (C) matches our estimate
- 10^2 (D) is far too low

The estimate converges around 1 million (10^6) gamma rays detected.
