There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

Let's solve this step by step:

1) The C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate operates based on the control qubit:
   - If the control qubit is |0>, the target qubit remains unchanged
   - If the control qubit is |1>, the target qubit is flipped

2) In the given input state \left|\psi\right\rangle, the first part is \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right) and the second part is \left|0\right\rangle

3) The condition for the C-NOT gate is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle

4) Since the control qubit is |0>, the target qubit remains in its original state |0>

5) This means the output state will look like:
   - The first part of the state remains the same
   - The second part (target qubit) also remains |0>

6) Looking at the options, this matches option A exactly

7) Let's verify the other options, which all seem to modify the target qubit when it should remain unchanged
