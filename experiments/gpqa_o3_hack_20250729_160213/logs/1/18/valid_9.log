Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, analyze the starting molecule:
• 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
• Contains an aldehyde group (-CHO)
• Contains a carbon-carbon double bond
• Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

2. Red phosphorus and HI is a strong reducing system that will:
• Reduce the aldehyde group to an alcohol
• Remove the vinyl group
• Reduce the double bond
• Remove the carboxylic acid group (converting to alkyl)

3. After reduction, the molecule will:
• Lose one double bond
• Lose the -CHO group
• Lose the -COOH group
• Become more saturated

4. Index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) calculation:
• IHD = Number of rings + Number of double/triple bonds
• In the reduced product, rings and double bonds will be reduced

5. After complete reduction, the expected IHD would be 1

The key is identifying the net reduction in unsaturation.
