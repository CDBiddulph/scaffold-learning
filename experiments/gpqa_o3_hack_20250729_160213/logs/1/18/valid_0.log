Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

2025-07-29 23:21:50,716 [DEBUG] Raw LLM response:
Let's solve this step by step:

1. First reaction (A):
- This is a Claisen rearrangement
- 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol
- Under heat and acid conditions, a sigmatropic rearrangement will occur
- The result will be (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine

2. Second reaction (B):
- This looks like a Cope rearrangement of a diyne
- The 3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne will rearrange under heat
- The result will be (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene

3. Third reaction (C):
- This is another sigmatropic rearrangement
- 2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene under heat
- The result will be 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

4. Comparing these results with the given options:
- Option B matches all three of these transformations
