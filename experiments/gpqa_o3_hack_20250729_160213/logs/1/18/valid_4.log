We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%

2. 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom has not decayed

3. This means the atom has survived the first 50 minutes, which changes our probability calculation

4. We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

5. This is a conditional probability problem - the probability of decay given survival so far

6. If the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, its remaining decay probability changes

7. Total time considered now is 200 minutes (50 + 150)

8. Original decay probability was 32% in 100 minutes
   - For 200 minutes, the decay probability will be higher

9. We can calculate this using the complementary probability:
   - Probability of no decay in 200 minutes = 1 - 0.32 Ã— (200/100) = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36

10. Therefore, probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - 0.36 = 0.44 or 44%
