In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the theoretical yield of the product:
• Starting material is benzoic acid (10 g)
• After reaction, 4 g of product was isolated
• Starting material recovered = 3 g

2. Theoretical yield calculation:
• Actual product yield = 4 g
• Initially present material = 10 g
• Material recovered = 3 g
• Net material consumed = 10 g - 3 g = 7 g

3. Percentage yield calculation:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100
• Theoretical yield = 7 g
• Actual yield = 4 g
• Percentage yield = (4/7) × 100 = 66.66%

4. TLC spot analysis:
• Students found two spots under UV light
• Suggesting presence of starting material and product

5. Checking options:
• Option B matches both conditions:
   - Two TLC spots
   - 66.66% yield

B
