What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:22:52,876 [DEBUG] Raw LLM response:
Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have a Ca-EDTA complex with a concentration of 0.02 M
2. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5x10^10

3. Dissociation reaction: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

4. Stability constant equation:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

5. Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = K * [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

6. Assuming complete dissociation and 1:1 stoichiometry:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5x10^10) * (0.02) / (0.02)

7. Calculating:
   [Ca²⁺] = 5x10^10 * 1 = 6.3x10^-7 M

8. Checking the options, this matches option B

B
