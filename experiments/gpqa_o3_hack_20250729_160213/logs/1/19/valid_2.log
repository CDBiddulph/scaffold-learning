In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:18:30,780 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand the details of the experiment:\n• Initial amount of benzoic acid = 10 g\n• Product isolated = 4 g\n• Starting material recovered = 3 g\n\n2. Calculate the theoretical yield:\n• If 10 g of benzoic acid was used, and 4 g of product was obtained\n• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100\n• Theoretical yield = 4 g\n\n3. Percentage yield calculation:\n• Percentage yield = (4 g / 10 g) × 100\n• Percentage yield = 0.4 × 100\n• Percentage yield = 40 %\n\n4. TLC analysis details:\n• Reaction mixture contains 3 spots under UV light\n• Indicates starting material, product, and solvent\n\n5. Examining the options:\n• The percentage yield is 40%\n• The number of TLC spots is 3\n• Option C matches these conditions\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nAnswer: C"
