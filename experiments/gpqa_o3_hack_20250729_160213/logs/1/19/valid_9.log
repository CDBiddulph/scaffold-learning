2025-07-29 23:19:19,420 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what happens when the molecule reacts with red phosphorus and HI:\n• This is typically a reduction reaction\n• Red phosphorus and HI can help remove oxygen and reduce the molecule\n\n2) Let's look at the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n• Has a formyl group (-CHO)\n• Has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2)\n• Has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n• Has a double bond in the cyclohexene ring\n\n3) After reduction with red phosphorus and HI:\n• Formyl group will be reduced to -CH2OH\n• Carboxylic acid group will be reduced to -CH2OH\n• Vinyl group will be reduced to -CH2CH3\n• Double bond in the ring will be reduced to a single bond\n\n4) The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) counts rings and double bonds\n• After reduction, no rings remain\n• No double bonds remain\n• So IHD = 0\n\n5) Checking the options, 0 corresponds to option B.\n\nAnswer: B"
