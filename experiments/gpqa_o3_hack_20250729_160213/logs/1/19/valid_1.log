Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:18:24,829 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the half-life of Caesium-137:\n• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years\n• 80 minutes is a very short time compared to its half-life, so decay rate will be essentially constant\n\n2. Radioactive decay calculation:\n• Total atoms = 10^17\n• Decay constant (λ) determines how many atoms decay per unit time\n• Approximately 10^12 atoms will decay per second\n\n3. Gamma-ray emission:\n• Each decaying atom typically emits 1-2 gamma rays\n• So roughly 10^12 - 10^13 gamma rays per second\n\n4. Detector considerations:\n• Detector size is 2x3 cm = 6 cm²\n• At 4 meters distance, this subtends a very small solid angle\n• Typical detection efficiency is ~10%\n• Total detected gamma rays will be a small fraction of total emitted\n\n5. Calculation estimate:\n• Roughly 10^5 to 10^6 gamma rays detected in 80 minutes\n\nLooking at the options, this most closely matches option C: 1 million (10^6).\n\nAnswer: C"
