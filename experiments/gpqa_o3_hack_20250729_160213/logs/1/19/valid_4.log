We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:18:44,545 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1) First, understand the initial decay probability:\n   - The atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes\n   - 50 minutes have already passed without decay\n\n2) This means the atom has survived the first 50 minutes, which changes the decay probability\n\n3) We can solve this using the conditional probability formula\n\n4) Original decay probability for 100 minutes = 32%\n   Surviving first 50 minutes means we now calculate probability for remaining 150 minutes\n\n5) Probability of decay = 1 - (1 - 0.32)^(150/100)\n   = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n   = 1 - 0.5743\n   = 0.4257\n   = 52%\n\n6) Let's verify the steps:\n   - Initial decay probability was 32%\n   - After 50 minutes, survival shifts the decay probability\n   - Calculation shows 52% chance of decay in next 150 minutes\n\n7) Looking at the options, 52% corresponds to option C\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\nAnswer: C"
