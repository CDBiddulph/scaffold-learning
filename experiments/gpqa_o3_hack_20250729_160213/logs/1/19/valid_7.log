There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-07-29 23:19:05,922 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) The C-NOT gate requires the first (control) qubit to be in the state |0⟩.\n\n2) In the given input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩, the second qubit is indeed in the |0⟩ state.\n\n3) For the C-NOT gate:\n   - When the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit\n   - When the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit would be flipped\n\n4) Since the first qubit is in the state (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩), and it contains a |0⟩ state component, the second qubit will remain in |0⟩.\n\n5) The first qubit will remain in its original state.\n\n6) So the output state will be the same as the input state.\n\n7) Looking at the given options, this matches option A.\n\nAnswer: A"
