d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b
D) d

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:18:37,388 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume.\n\n2. Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have the same density as Earth, around 5.5 g/cm^3.\n\n3. Option b: The planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm^3, which suggests a proportionally similar volume.\n\n4. Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive would likely have a larger radius, but not 5 times larger. This means its density would increase.\n\n5. If the volume doesn't increase proportionally with mass, the density will be higher.\n\n6. Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass would have a smaller radius, leading to a higher density.\n\n7. Comparing these options, option c (a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive) would have the highest density.\n\n8. This is because increasing mass while maintaining similar compositional structure would compress the planet, increasing its overall density.\n\nAnswer: A"
