What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-07-29 23:19:12,471 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) We have a Ca-EDTA complex with a known concentration and stability constant (KCa-EDTA)\n\n2) The dissociation reaction is: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n3) Stability constant (K) = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]\n\n4) Rearranging the equation: [Ca²⁺] = K * [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]\n\n5) We know:\n   - Initial [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M\n   - K = 5 × 10¹⁰\n   - Assume [Ca-EDTA] ≈ initial concentration\n\n6) Substituting values:\n   [Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10¹⁰) * 0.02 / 1\n   [Ca²⁺] = 1.0 × 10⁻² M\n\n7) This matches option A.\n\nAnswer: A"
