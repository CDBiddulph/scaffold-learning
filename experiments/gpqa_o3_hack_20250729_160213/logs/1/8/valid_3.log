a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b
D) d

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is calculated by mass divided by volume.

2. Option a) describes an Earth-like planet with typical density.

3. Option b) has a specified density of 5.5 g/cm^3, which is exactly Earth's average density.

4. Option c) is a planet with Earth's composition but 5 times more massive:
   - More mass
   - Same composition (implied density)
   - Larger radius to accommodate more mass
   - Overall density will remain the same as Earth's

5. Option d) has Earth's composition but half the mass:
   - Less mass
   - Same composition
   - Smaller radius proportional to mass
   - Density will remain unchanged

6. Comparing the options:
   - Option a, c, and d all have essentially Earth's density
   - Option b explicitly states a density of 5.5 g/cm^3

7. Since the question asks for the highest density, option b stands out.

A
