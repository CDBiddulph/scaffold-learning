Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope that decays by emitting beta particles and gamma rays.

2. The half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years, which is about 15,768,000 minutes.

3. In 80 minutes, the decay will be minimal compared to the total number of atoms.

4. Cs-137 emits gamma rays with a probability of about 0.85 per decay.

5. Total number of atoms: 10^17

6. Each decay produces approximately 1 gamma ray.

7. Detection probability depends on detector size and distance:
• Detector is 2x3 cm = 6 cm²
• Typical solid angle at 4 meters is quite small
• Roughly 0.1% of emitted gamma rays will be detected

8. Estimated gamma ray detection:
• (10^17 atoms) × (0.85 gamma rays/decay) × (0.001 detection probability)
≈ 10^6 gamma rays

9. This aligns perfectly with option C: 1 million (10^6)
