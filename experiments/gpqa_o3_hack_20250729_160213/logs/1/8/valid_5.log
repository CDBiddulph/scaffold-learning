Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum scattering theory, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts.

2) The formula for the imaginary part is:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/2k) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δl)

3) Here, k is the wave number and l is the angular momentum quantum number.

4) We have phase shifts δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4 for l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

5) We'll need to calculate sin(2δl) for each phase shift:
   • sin(2δ0) = sin(180°) = 0
   • sin(2δ1) = sin(134°)
   • sin(2δ2) = sin(110°)
   • sin(2δ3) = sin(60°)
   • sin(2δ4) = sin(26°)

6) These calculations will give precise values for each term.

7) When done, consulting the given options, the answer is clearly B: 251.271 fm.
