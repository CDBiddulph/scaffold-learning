how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D) 11

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide:
   - This adds a methyl group to the aldehyde
   - Resulting in an alcohol (product 1)

2. Product 1 is then treated with pyridinium chlorochromate:
   - This oxidizes the alcohol back to an aldehyde
   - The carbon skeleton remains unchanged

3. The final reaction involves (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO:
   - This looks like a Wittig-type reaction
   - It will likely extend the carbon chain

4. Let's count carbons in trans-cinnamaldehyde:
   - It has 9 carbons (3 in the phenyl ring, 6 in the side chain)

5. After adding a methyl group and then doing the final reaction:
   - We likely end up with an 11-carbon molecule

6. Let's verify by checking the given options:
   - 10 carbons seems too few
   - 14 carbons seems too many
   - 12 carbons seems too many
   - 11 carbons matches our reasoning
