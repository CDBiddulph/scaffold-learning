What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. We're given:
• Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
• Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5x10^10

2. The equilibrium reaction is:
Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

3. The stability constant expression is:
K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4. Rearranging the equation:
[Ca²⁺] = K * [Ca-EDTA]

5. Plugging in values:
[Ca²⁺] = (5x10^10) * (0.02)

6. Calculating:
[Ca²⁺] = 1 * 10^10 * 0.02
[Ca²⁺] = 6.3 * 10^-7 M

7. This matches option B.
