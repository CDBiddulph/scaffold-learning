In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, note the details about the TLC analysis:
• The students saw spots under UV light
• The question suggests these spots represent starting material, product, and solvent

2. The number of spots matters for the first part of the answer:
• If there are TWO spots, this suggests product and starting material
• If there are THREE spots, this includes a third spot (likely the solvent)

3. Calculate the percentage yield:
• Initial amount of benzoic acid = 10 g
• Product obtained = 4 g
• Theoretical yield calculation:
   Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%
   = (4 g / 6 g) × 100%
   = 0.6666 × 100%
   = 66.66%

4. Cross-check the conditions:
• Two spots under TLC
• Percentage yield of 66.66%

5. This matches option B exactly:
• A = two
• B = 66.66%
