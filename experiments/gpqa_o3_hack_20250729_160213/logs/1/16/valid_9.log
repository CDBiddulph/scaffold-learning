2025-07-29 23:17:56,181 [INFO] Raw LLM response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what happens in the reaction:\n• Red phosphorus and HI will cause complete reduction of functional groups\n• The reaction will convert all functional groups to saturated forms\n• This means converting the aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and alkene groups\n\n2. The original molecule (2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid) has:\n• A cyclohexene ring\n• An aldehyde group\n• A carboxylic acid group\n• A vinyl group\n\n3. After complete reduction with HI/red phosphorus:\n• The cyclohexene will become a fully saturated cyclohexane\n• The aldehyde will become a CH2 group\n• The carboxylic acid will become a CH2CH3 group\n• The vinyl group will become a CH2CH3 group\n\n4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) calculation:\n• IHD = Number of rings + Number of π bonds\n• In the reduced product: No rings, no π bonds\n• Therefore, IHD = 0\n\n5. Checking the options, 0 corresponds to option B.\n\nAnswer: B"
