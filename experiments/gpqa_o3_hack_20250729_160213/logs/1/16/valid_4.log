We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:17:21,482 [INFO] Raw LLM response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, note that 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom has not decayed.\n\n2) The original decay probability was 32% within 100 minutes.\n\n3) We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived 50 minutes.\n\n4) This is a conditional probability problem. We can solve it using the complement of the probability of survival.\n\n5) The probability of survival for 100 minutes was originally 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 or 68%.\n\n6) We want the probability of decay in the remaining 150 minutes.\n\n7) We can calculate this as: P(decay in 150 minutes | survived 50 minutes) = 1 - [P(survival in 50 more minutes) / P(survival in 50 minutes)]\n\n8) Using exponential decay principles, this translates to: 1 - (0.68^(150/100)) / (0.68^(50/100))\n\n9) Calculating this gives approximately 0.52 or 52%\n\n10) Checking the options, this corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C"
