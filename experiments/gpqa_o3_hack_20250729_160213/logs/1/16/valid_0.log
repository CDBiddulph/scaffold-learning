Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:16:46,849 [INFO] Raw LLM response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First reaction (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)):\n- This is a Claisen rearrangement\n- The terminal pi bond will migrate\n- The product will be (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine\n\n2. Second reaction ((3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat):\n- This is a Cope rearrangement\n- The terminal alkynes will rearrange\n- The product will be (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene\n\n3. Third reaction (2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat):\n- This is another sigmatropic rearrangement\n- Will result in 4-methylenehexan-1-ol\n\nThese details match option D perfectly.\n\nAnswer: D"
