2025-07-29 23:17:10,671 [INFO] Raw LLM response: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume.\n\n2. Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have a density identical to Earth's standard density of about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n3. Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³ would have the same density as Earth.\n\n4. Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive would also be 5 times larger in volume (to maintain the same composition). So its density would remain unchanged at 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n5. Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass would need to be half the volume. Density = mass/volume would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n6. When composition remains the same, density stays constant. Mass and volume scale proportionally.\n\n7. Therefore, all these scenarios result in the same density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nHowever, the question asks which planet has the HIGHEST density. Since they're all essentially equal, this requires picking the option that seems most dense.\n\nAnswer: C"
