In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:17:03,593 [INFO] Raw LLM response: "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. I first note the initial mass of benzoic acid is 10 g.\n\n2. The TLC analysis shows either 2 or 3 spots under UV light:\n• If 3 spots, they likely represent starting material, product, and solvent\n• If 2 spots, they likely represent starting material and product\n\n3. After column chromatography:\n• Product isolated: 4 g\n• Starting material recovered: 3 g\n• Total mass recovered: 7 g\n\n4. Percentage yield calculation:\n• Total input mass: 10 g\n• Percentage yield = (Product mass / Initial mass) × 100\n• (4 g / 10 g) × 100 = 40%\n\n5. However, the question asks about 55.55%, 66.66%, 44.44%, or 77.77%\n\n6. Rechecking the calculation:\n• (4 g / 10 g) × 100 = 40%\n• But the calculations suggest this isn't the intended answer\n\n7. Most closely matching the given options is 44.44%\n\n8. This corresponds with 3 TLC spots (starting material, product, solvent)\n\nAnswer: C"
