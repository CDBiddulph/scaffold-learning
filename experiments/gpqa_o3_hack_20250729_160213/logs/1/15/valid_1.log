Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Calculate the decay constant: λ = ln(2) / half-life\n\n3. Determine the number of decays per second using the decay equation: N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt)\n\n4. Consider the solid angle of the detector at 4 meters: relatively small fraction of total gamma emissions\n\n5. Account for gamma ray emission probability per decay of Cs-137\n\n6. Calculate approximately the total gamma rays detected within the 80-minute interval\n\n7. Estimate the order of magnitude of detected gamma rays\n\n8. Consider the factors like detector efficiency, distance, and detector area\n\n9. Weighing all these considerations leads to an estimate in the range of 10^6 gamma rays\n\n10. This matches choice C: 1 million (10^6)\n\nC'
