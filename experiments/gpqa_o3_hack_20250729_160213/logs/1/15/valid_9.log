2025-07-29 23:13:01,702 [WARNING] Attempt 0: Unexpected LLM output -> 'Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1. Analyze the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n- Contains an aldehyde group (-CHO)\n- Contains a double bond in the cyclohexene ring\n- Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n- Has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2)\n\n2. Consider the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and excess HI\n- This is a reducing and deiodinating environment\n- Will likely reduce double bonds\n- Will convert aldehyde to alkyl group\n- Will reduce vinyl group to alkyl group\n- May also potentially modify carboxylic acid group\n\n3. Calculate index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD)\n- IHD represents number of rings and/or multiple bonds\n- Starting molecule initially has IHD = 2 (ring and double bond)\n- After reduction, rings and multiple bonds would be eliminated\n\n4. Carefully count remaining unsaturations after reduction\n- No rings remain\n- No double/triple bonds remain\n\n5. Calculate final IHD\n- IHD = 0\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 0.\n\nAnswer: B'

2025-07-29 23:13:10,423 [WARNING] Attempt 2: Unexpected LLM output -> "Let me solve this step by step:\n1. First, I'll analyze the structure of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n2. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI will likely reduce and remove functional groups\n3. I'll count the hydrogen deficiency by checking rings, double bonds, and triple bonds\n4. The original molecule has a cyclohexene ring (1 ring), a double bond (1 hydrogen deficiency)\n5. It also has an aldehyde group (1 hydrogen deficiency)\n6. And a carboxylic acid group (1 hydrogen deficiency)\n7. Total hydrogen deficiency in original molecule is 3\n8. After reduction with HI, likely products will remove most functional groups\n9. The reduction will likely convert aldehyde and carboxylic acid to saturated groups\n10. The resulting molecule will retain the cyclic structure\n11. So the hydrogen deficiency will likely reduce to 1\n\nC"
