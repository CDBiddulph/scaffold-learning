The answer must be exactly {length} letters long.

CRITICAL CROSSWORD RULES:
- Use ONLY common crossword answers - avoid obscure words
- For "Sweetie pie" type clues, prefer HON over BAE
- For plural clues (ending in 's'), give plural answers
- For "Diddly-squat" type clues, prefer NADA over ZERO
- For "Goes extinct" type clues, prefer DIESOUT over EXPIRES
- For climate change clues, GLOBALWARMING is very common
- For "Spilling the tea" type clues, prefer DISHING over GOSSIPING
- For "Barking orders" type clues, consider BOSSY (adjective) not just YELLS (verb)
- For "Carbon-based energy source" ({length} letters), think FOSSILFUEL
- For "Discovery" type clues, consider FIND as a common short answer
- Pay attention to word endings - EST is common for superlatives
- Common crossword words: AORTA, ABUT, NADA, OLIN, TOSCA, NIELSEN

EXAMPLES:
- "Most clichÃ©d" (7 letters) = TRITEST (not HACKEST)
- "Pleasant to recall" (4 letters) = FOND (not DEAR)
- "Traditional head garments for Sikh men" (7 letters) = TURBANS (plural!)

Think carefully about the exact wording and length. Give the most common crossword answer.
