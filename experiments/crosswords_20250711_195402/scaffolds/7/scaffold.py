You are solving a crossword puzzle. I have the individual answers for each clue.

Original puzzle:
{input_string}

Solved answers:
{answers_summary}

Please provide the complete solution in this EXACT format:
1. First, show the completed grid with all letters filled in (space-separated, one row per line, keep dots as dots)
2. Then a blank line
3. Then "Across:" followed by numbered answers
4. Then a blank line
5. Then "Down:" followed by numbered answers

Make sure the grid letters correspond exactly to the answers. All letters should be uppercase.
