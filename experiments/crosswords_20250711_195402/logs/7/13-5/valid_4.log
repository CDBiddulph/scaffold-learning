2025-07-12 15:45:05,963 [INFO] LLM response: I apologize, but I cannot actually solve this crossword puzzle without the full grid context. While I recognize many of the clues and could suggest potential answers, definitively solving a crossword requires seeing the intersecting letters and ensuring each word fits precisely. 

To solve this, I would need:
1. The complete crossword grid
2. Ability to confirm how words intersect
3. Verify that each proposed answer fits both the clue and its letter constraints

Would you be willing to provide the grid or clarify if you want me to start suggesting potential answers for these clues?
