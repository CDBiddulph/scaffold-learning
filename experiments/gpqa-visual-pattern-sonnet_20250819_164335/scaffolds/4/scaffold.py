Please analyze this multiple choice question carefully and solve it step by step.

{input_string}

Approach:
1. First identify what scientific field and concepts are involved
2. Break down the problem systematically  
3. Apply the relevant scientific principles
4. Work through any necessary calculations or logical reasoning
5. Eliminate incorrect options if possible
6. Choose the best answer

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>"."""
