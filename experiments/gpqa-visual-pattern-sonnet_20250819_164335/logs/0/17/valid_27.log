=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


■ D) -12*hbar/25

2025-08-19 23:56:30,382 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)

2) The expectation value of spin along y is calculated as:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) ψ = [3i; 4]

5) First, l...
