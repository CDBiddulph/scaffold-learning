=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
■ C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-19 23:56:29,785 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole:
   S = kB * A / (4 * l_p^2)
   Where:
   - kB is Boltzmann's constant
   - A is the surface ar...
