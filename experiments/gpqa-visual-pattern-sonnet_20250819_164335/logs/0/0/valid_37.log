=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

■ A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:41,780 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's consider what forces are involved:
   • Gravitational force (attractive)
   • Electrostatic force (repulsive/attractive depending on charge)

2) The smallest attainable charge is the elementary charge (e), and the smallest attainable mass would be related to the electron mass.

3) Gravitational force between two particles follows Newton's law: F_g = G(m1*m2)/r^2
   • G is gravitational constant
   • m1, m2 are masses
   • r is distance

4) Electros...
