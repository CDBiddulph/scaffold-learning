=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:39,972 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the decay of Caesium-137:
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
- Decay constant λ = ln(2) / (30 years × 365 days/year × 24 hours/day)

2) After 80 minutes (1.33 hours), the fraction of atoms decayed will be small.

3) Radioactive decay follows the equation:
N = N₀ × e^(-λt)
Where N₀ = 10^17 atoms

4) Activity (number of decays per second) depends on the decay constant.

5) The detector is 4 meters away, with a 2×3 cm surface.
