=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
â–  D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:22,965 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the given input-output pairs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. We need to find a pattern that transforms the input string to the output number.

3. Let's examine the lengths and numeric values:
   AGG: 3 letters
   TGCTGA: 6 letters
   ACAGTGACC: 9 letters

4. The pattern seems to involve converting letters to some numeric value and then doing a calculation.

5. If we convert letters to their numeric position in the alphabet:
   A = 1, C ...
