Name reactions in chemistry refer to a specific set of well-known chemical reactions that are typically named after their discoverers or the scientists who made significant contributions to their development. These reactions have had a profound impact on the field of chemistry and are often used as fundamental building blocks in various chemical syntheses.
Identify the reactants for the following name reactions.
A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol

A) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
B) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene
C) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
■ D) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:37,269 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the first reaction:
   - Involves A + H2SO4
   - Produces 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
   - This looks like an oxidation reaction of an alcohol to a ketone
   - So A must be the alcohol precursor: 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol

2) Now the second reaction:
   - Involves B + BuLi + H+
   - Produces 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol
   - This looks like a reaction where an aldehyde or ketone is converted to an alcohol
   - So B must be t...
