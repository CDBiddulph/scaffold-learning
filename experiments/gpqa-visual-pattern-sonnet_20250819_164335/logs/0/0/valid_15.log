=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
■ D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:21,977 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) In Feynman diagram calculations, the number of loops is directly related to the power of the loop integration measure.

2) In quantum field theory, each loop corresponds to a factor of 1/(4π)^n, where n is the number of loops.

3) In the given expression, we see 1/(4π)^6.

4) If we want to find n in 1/(4π)^n = 1/(4π)^6, we solve:
   n = 6

5) This means the number of loops in the original Feynman diagram is 6.

6) Looking at the options, 6 corresponds to opti...
