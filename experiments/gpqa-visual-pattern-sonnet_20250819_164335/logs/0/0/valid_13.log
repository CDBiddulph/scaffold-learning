2025-08-19 23:45:38,016 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT is:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• It's a framework for describing physics beyond the Standard Model

2. Let's examine each symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
• Fundamental to all relativistic quantum field theories
• SMEFT must respect Lorentz invariance
• This is a MUST

Poincare Symmetry:
• Combines Lorentz symmetry with spacetime translations
• Also fundamental to relativistic field theories
• SMEFT must respe...
