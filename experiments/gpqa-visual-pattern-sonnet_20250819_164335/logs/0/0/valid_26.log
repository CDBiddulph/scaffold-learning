2025-08-19 23:45:39,300 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole:
   S = kA/4l_p^2
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and l_p is the Planck length

2) Angular size θ is related to the radius R of the event horizon by:
   θ = R/d (in radians)

3) Given: θ = 10^-17 degrees = 10^-19 radians
   Distance d = 10^10 parsecs

4) Radius of event horizon:
   R = θ * d = 10^-19 * 10^10 = 10^-9 parsecs

5) Convert parsecs t...
