Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

2025-08-19 23:45:41,292 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relation between the scattering amplitude and phase shifts along the incident beam direction (S-wave):

   $f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)P_l(0)$

2) Note that $P_l(0)$ is just the Legendre polynomial at cosθ = 1, which has the following values:
   • $P_0(0) = 1$
   • $P_1(0) = 0$
   • $P_2(0) = -1/2$
   • $P_3(0) = 0$
   • $P_4(0) = 3/8$

3) The scattering amplitude calculation becomes:
   $f(0) = \frac{1}{k}[1 \s...
