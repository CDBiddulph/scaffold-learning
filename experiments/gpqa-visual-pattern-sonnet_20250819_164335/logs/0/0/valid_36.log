=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

â–  A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:38,844 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the context:
- The satellites are in low Earth orbit
- Object localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Analyzing localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular measurement
- This suggests the objects are very far away

3. Evaluating distance scales:
- 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds (Option D) are very close distances, near solar syst...
