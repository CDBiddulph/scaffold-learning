2025-08-19 23:45:40,262 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide:
   - This will add a methyl group to the aldehyde, forming an alcohol (product 1)
   - Starting carbon count: 9 carbons from trans-cinnamaldehyde + 1 carbon from methyl group = 10 carbons

2) Product 1 is then treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC):
   - PCC oxidizes the alcohol back to an aldehyde
   - Carbon count remains 10

3) This aldehyde is then treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulf...
