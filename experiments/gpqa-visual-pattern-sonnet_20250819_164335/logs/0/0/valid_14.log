Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
■ D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:24,440 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the configuration:
   - 13 total identical charges with 2e each
   - 12 charges are positioned in a sphere of radius 2m around point P
   - 13th charge is at point P itself

2) Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) For the 12 charges on the sphere surface:
   - Each charge is interacting with every other charge
   - Charges are symmetric, so potential will be uniform
   - Total interactions for 12 charges = (12 * 11)/2 = 66 inte...
