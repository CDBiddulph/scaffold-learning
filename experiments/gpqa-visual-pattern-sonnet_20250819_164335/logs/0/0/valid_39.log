=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
â–  D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:41,345 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this carefully:

1. First, let's understand what's happening:
- ChIP-seq was done with PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation
- An antibody to IKAROS transcription factor was used
- Peaks disappeared when fixation method changed to PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate)

2. Consider the context of transcription factor binding:
- Transcription factors like IKAROS typically bind at regulatory regions
- These are most commonly active promoters and enhancers

3. Analyze the fixation method change:
