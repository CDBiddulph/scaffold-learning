=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

■ A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:39,971 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial volume ratio:
   • (A+B):C = 1:2.25
   • A:B is 1:1
   • Total volume of A+B:C = 1:2.25

2) Let's set up initial volumes:
   • Let A = x
   • B = x (since A:B is 1:1)
   • C = 2.25 * (x+x) = 4.5

3) Key observation is that water and HHal acid are the only products

4) Since densities differ by 2.11, and volumes are 1:1, gases A and B must be halogen hydrides or similar compounds

5) The balanced reaction will have these stoic...
