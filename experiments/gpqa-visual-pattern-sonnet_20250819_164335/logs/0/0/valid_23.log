a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-19 23:45:39,890 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the magnitude relation equation:
m = M + 5log(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs

2) For option A (star with apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at 20 parsecs):
   - This is a direct apparent magnitude, so it will appear as 7 mag

3) For option B (two-star system with absolute magnitudes of 7 and 7 at 10 parsecs):
   - At 10 parsecs, these would both have apparent magnitudes of 7
   - The combined...
