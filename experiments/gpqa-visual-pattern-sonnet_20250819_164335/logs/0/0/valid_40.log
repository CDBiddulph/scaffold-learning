=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



â–  D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:45:39,087 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relativistic velocity addition formula. When an object (in this case, light) moves through a medium that is itself moving, the relative velocity is given by a specific formula.

2) In this problem:
   - Speed of light in vacuum (c) = 1
   - Speed of light in glass = 1/n (where n is the index of refraction)
   - Velocity of glass = v
   - Direction of motion is the same as the light beam's direction

3) The relativistic velocity addition formul...
