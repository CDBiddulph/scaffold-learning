=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
■ C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:38,494 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the reaction conditions:
• Starting material is 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol
• Acid was used, which suggests an elimination reaction
• IR spectrum shows an absorption at 1690 cm^-1, which indicates a C=O or C=C bond

2) Analyze the possible elimination mechanisms:
• Acid-catalyzed dehydration of a diol can potentially create multiple products
• The key is to look for a product with a characteristic IR absorption

3) Evaluate the C=O absorption:...
