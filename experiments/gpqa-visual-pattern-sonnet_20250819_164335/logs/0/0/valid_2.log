=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
â–  B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:22,698 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. TLC Analysis:
- The question states that under UV light, the reaction mixture contained A spots
- This suggests the presence of:
   * Starting material
   * Product
   * Solvent
- So A should be three spots

2. Yield Calculation:
- Started with 10 g of benzoic acid
- After column chromatography:
   * Isolated product: 4 g
   * Recovered starting material: 3 g

3. Percentage Yield Calculation:
- Total material recovered: 4 g + 3 g = 7 g
- To calculate percentage...
