2025-08-19 23:45:37,235 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the relationship between light energy and color
• Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
• The color of light absorbed is complementary to the color emitted

2) The given energy is 2.3393 eV

3) To determine the color of absorbed light, we need to recognize the complementary color to the emitted light

4) Let's convert the energy to wavelength using E = hc/λ
• This isn't strictly necessary, but can help verify our reasoni...
