2025-08-19 23:45:39,549 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what happens during the reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI:
   - This is typically a reduction reaction
   - Red phosphorus and HI will help break carbon-oxygen bonds and reduce the molecule
   - Functional groups like aldehyde (-CHO) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) will be converted to alkyl groups

2. Analyze the starting molecule (2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid):
   - Contains an aldehyde group
   - Contains a carbo...
