=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
â–  C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:45:42,694 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a bridged bicyclic ketone.

2) UV irradiation likely causes a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition, forming a cyclobutane ring. The product would still have the same molecular weight.

3) The palladium on carbon with hydrogen is a hydrogenation reaction, which typically reduces double bonds.

4) The photocycloaddition would create a new ring structure with symmetric constraints.

5) After hydrogenation, the molecule will have mu...
