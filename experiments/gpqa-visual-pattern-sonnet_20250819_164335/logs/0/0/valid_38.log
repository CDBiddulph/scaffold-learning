2025-08-19 23:45:36,876 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the Cope rearrangement:
- It's a thermal [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement
- It involves migration of π systems and rearrangement of atoms
- Typically preserves stereochemistry

2) Examine the starting molecule's structure:
- It's a bicyclic compound with a vinyl group and an azabicyclo ring
- Has specific stereochemistry at two centers (1S, 4R)

3) In a Cope rearrangement, we expect:
- Rearrangement of double bonds
- Movement of substitue...
