2025-08-19 23:45:38,269 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   Peak Energy ∝ Temperature

2) Star A's peak energy: 7.21 eV
   Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio can be calculated by dividing peak energies:
   T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

4) We're also told the star is 24 times more luminous than the sun.

5) Luminosity is related to radius and temperature by the equation:
   L ∝ R² * T⁴

6) Let's rearrange this: R ...
