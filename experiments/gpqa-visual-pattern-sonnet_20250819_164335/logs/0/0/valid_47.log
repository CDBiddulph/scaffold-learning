=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
â–  D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:38,168 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what Oblique Parameters are:
- They are parametric corrections to the electroweak precision measurements
- They help probe potential new physics beyond the Standard Model

2) Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance line shapes and finite-width effects in particle interactions

3) In multi-Higgs-doublet models, these corrections can potentially modify the precision of measurement constraints

4) The key question is whether these Brei...
