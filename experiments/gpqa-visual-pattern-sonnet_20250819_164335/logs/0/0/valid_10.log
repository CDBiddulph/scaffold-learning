2025-08-19 23:45:22,785 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The reaction involves 9-fluorenone and selectfluor under 400nm light irradiation.

2. The 19F NMR shows two fluorine signals:
   - One at +29.8 ppm
   - Another at -115.7 ppm

3. This suggests that two fluorine atoms have been introduced to the molecule.

4. The specific chemical shifts suggest these fluorines are in different chemical environments.

5. Looking at the options:
   - Option A suggests 2,6-difluoro substitution
   - Option B suggests a single fluo...
