2025-08-19 23:45:22,038 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   - We have a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex
   - The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5x10^10
   - Temperature is 25°C
   - We want to find the free calcium ion concentration

2) The dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

3) The stability constant (K) is given by:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = K[Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5) At equilibri...
