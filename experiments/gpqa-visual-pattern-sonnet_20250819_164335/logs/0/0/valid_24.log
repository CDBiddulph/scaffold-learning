Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

â–  A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:39,277 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s

2) Distance = Speed * Time
   - Zeta: 0.96c * 1e-5s * (3 * 10^8 m/s) = 28.8 km
   - Eta: 0.9c * 1e-5s * (3 * 10^8 m/s) = 27 km
   - Chi: 0.88c * 1e-5s * (3 * 10^8 m/s) = 26.4 km
   - Lambda: 0.93c * 1e-5s * (3 * 10^8 m/s) = 27.9 km

3) We started at 13 km altitude, so we need to see which particles reach the ground

4) Comparing the distances:
   - Zeta reaches 28.8 km - passes ground
