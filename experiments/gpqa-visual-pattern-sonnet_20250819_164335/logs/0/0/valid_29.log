Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
â–  D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:45:40,906 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must:
   - Have a saturated structure
   - Contain a carbon asymmetric center (chiral carbon)

2) To determine the molecular formula, I'll calculate the empirical formula by:
   - Using the percentage composition
   - Dividing by atomic weights (C = 12, H = 1)

3) Let's calculate the ratio of C to H for each option:
   A) 83.33/12 : 16.66/1 = 6.94 : 16.66 = 1 : 2.4
   B) 83.72/12 : 16.27/1 = 6.98 : 16.27 = 1 : 2.33
