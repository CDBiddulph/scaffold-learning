2025-08-19 23:45:38,308 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin in a given direction is calculated by:
   <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ

2) Here, ψ = (3i, 4) is the given spin state vector.

3) Let's first calculate σ_y * ψ:
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix} 
   * 
   \begin{pmatrix}
   3i \\
   4
   \end{pmatrix}
   = 
   \begin{pmatrix}
   -i * 4 \\
   i * 3i
   \end{pmatrix}
   = 
   \begin{pmatrix}
   -4i \\
   -3
   \end{pmatrix}

4) Now, the ψ† (conjugate...
