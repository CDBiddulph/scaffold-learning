2025-08-19 23:45:37,582 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand density: Density = Mass / Volume

2) Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
   - This would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3) Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and density of 5.5 g/cm³
   - If the radius remains the same as Earth, this would mean higher mass in the same volume
   - This suggests a denser planet

4) Option c: A planet with Earth's composition, 5 times more massive
   - If the mass increase...
