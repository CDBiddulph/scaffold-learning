=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
â–  B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
