=== INPUT ===
Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
