=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



â–  D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-20 00:19:52,215 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the principles of relativistic velocity transformation:
   - We have a light beam moving through a medium (glass) with refractive index n
   - The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the observer
   - We want to find the speed of light relative ...
