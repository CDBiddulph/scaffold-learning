=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

■ A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:18:50,925 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) Initial mixture conditions:
• Volume ratio (A+B) : C = 1 : 2.25
• Volume ratio A : B = 1 : 1
• Densities of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11

2) Let's find the molecular masses of A and B:
• Let A's molecular mass be x
• B's molecular mass will be 2.11x
• Volume ...
