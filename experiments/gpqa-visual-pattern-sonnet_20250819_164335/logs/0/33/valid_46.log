=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-20 00:19:54,419 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Wien displacement law relates peak wavelength to temperature:
   λ_max ∝ 1/T

2) Peak photon energies are inversely proportional to temperature:
   Peak Energy ∝ 1/T

3) For star A, peak energy is 7.21 eV
   For the sun, peak energy is 1.41 eV
