=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
■ C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-20 00:19:50,882 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the key facts about black hole entropy:
• Black hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon
• It is typically measured in the Bekenstein-Hawking formula as S = kA/4l²

2) Angular size gives us information about the event horizo...
