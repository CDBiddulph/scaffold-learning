2025-08-20 00:19:52,488 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Recall the density formula: Density = Mass / Volume

2. Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
- This is essentially a planet exactly like Earth
- Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³
- No changes in mass or volume

3. Option b: 2 Earth masses, density of 5....
