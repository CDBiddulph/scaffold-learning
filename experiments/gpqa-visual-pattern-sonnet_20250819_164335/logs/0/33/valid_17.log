=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
â–  B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
