=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
â–  C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:19:52,472 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol
- This is a diol with two phenyl groups
- When treated with acid, it can undergo an elimination reaction

2. IR spectrum analysis
- Strong absorption at 1690 cm^-1
- This wavenumber suggests a C=O (carbonyl) or C=C (al...
