2025-08-20 00:19:53,317 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the given inputs and outputs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. We need to understand the pattern or algorithm that maps the input sequence to the output number.

3. Let's count some characteristics of the inputs and outputs:
   - AGG: 3 chara...
