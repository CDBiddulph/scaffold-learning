=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
■ B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:18:49,867 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. TLC Analysis:
• The problem states that the TLC showed A spots under UV light
• These spots represent starting material, product, and solvent
• Total number of spots would be three
• So A = three

2. Yield Calculation:
• Initial mass of benzoic acid = 10 g
• Mass o...
