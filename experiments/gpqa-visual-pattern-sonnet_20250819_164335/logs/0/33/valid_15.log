=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
â–  D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:19:53,798 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's approach this systematically:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram directly relates to the power of the loop integration measure.

2) The key phrase is "1/(4pi)^6" in the notation.

3) In loop calculations, the power of the integration measure typically corresp...
