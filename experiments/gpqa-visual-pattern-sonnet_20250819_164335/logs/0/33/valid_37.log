=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

■ A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:19:51,841 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the fundamental forces acting on these point particles:
   • The attractive force is likely gravitational
   • The repulsive force is likely electrostatic (Coulomb's force)

2) The gravitational force follows Newton's law: F_g = G(m1m2)/r²
