=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
■ B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:18:49,201 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial decay probability:
• After 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%
• So, the probability of NOT decaying within 100 minutes is 68%

2) We've already waited 50 minutes, and the atom has NOT decayed yet
• This means we've "sur...
