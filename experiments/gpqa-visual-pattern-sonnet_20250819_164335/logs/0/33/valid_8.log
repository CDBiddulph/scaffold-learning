What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
■ B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-20 00:18:50,880 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the reaction:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant is given as KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10

3) We can write the equilibrium expression:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) We know the initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-E...
