2025-08-20 00:18:50,086 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting compound: trans-cinnamaldehyde
- This is C9H8O (9 carbon atoms)
- It has a carbon chain with a terminal aldehyde group

2. First reaction: treatment with methylmagnesium bromide
- This will add a methyl group to the aldehyde
- Product 1 will be a carbinol ...
