=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-20 00:18:50,425 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the requirements:
- We need to PCR amplify the given sequence
- We want to clone it directionally into the expression vector
- The vector's multiple cloning site (MCS) has HindIII, BamHI, and KpnI sites

2. Examine the PCR primer requirements:
- W...
