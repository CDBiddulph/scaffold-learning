2025-08-20 00:19:53,843 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what's happening in the reaction:
• The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
• It's being reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI
• This suggests a reductive process

2. Analyze the initial molecule's structur...
