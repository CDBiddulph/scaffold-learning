An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


■ D) -12*hbar/25

2025-08-20 00:18:50,349 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   • <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ
   • Where ψ is the spin state vector and ψ† is its conjugate transpose

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   • ψ = [3i, 4]

3) First, compute ψ†:
   • ψ† = [−3i, 4]

4) Now compute...
