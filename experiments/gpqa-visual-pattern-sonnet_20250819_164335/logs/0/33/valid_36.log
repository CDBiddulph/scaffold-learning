=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

â–  A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:18:50,320 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests the objects are very distant

2. The text mentions the distribution is isotropic, meaning uniformly distributed in all directions
