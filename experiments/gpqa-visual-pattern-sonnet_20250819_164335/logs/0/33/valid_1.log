=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:19:55,112 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the key properties of Caesium-137:
- Half-life is about 30 years
- Each decay emits a gamma-ray
- The decay constant λ will determine decay rate

2. Number of atoms calculation:
- Total atoms = 10^17
- This is a very large number of atoms

3. Decay ra...
