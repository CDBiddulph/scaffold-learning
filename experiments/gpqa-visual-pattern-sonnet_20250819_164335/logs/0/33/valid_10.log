9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
■ B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

2025-08-20 00:18:50,060 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material analysis:
• 9-fluorenone is a ketone with a fused ring system
• Selectfluor is a fluorination reagent
• 400nm light suggests a photochemical transformation

2. NMR signal analysis:
• Two fluorine signals: +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm
• This suggests t...
