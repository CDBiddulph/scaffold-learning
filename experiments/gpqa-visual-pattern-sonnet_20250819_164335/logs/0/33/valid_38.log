2025-08-20 00:19:53,499 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what a Cope rearrangement is:
- A Cope rearrangement involves the thermal isomerization of 1,5-dienes
- It requires a specific stereochemistry and geometry
- Involves a concerted [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement

2) Analyze the starting molec...
