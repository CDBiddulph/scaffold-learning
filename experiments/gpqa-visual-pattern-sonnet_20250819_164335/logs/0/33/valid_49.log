bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
■ C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-20 00:19:53,030 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the structure of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one:
• It's a rigid, three-bridged bicyclic ketone
• Has a strained ring system

2) UV irradiation suggests a photochemical reaction:
• Likely involves a [2+2] cycloaddition of the ketone
• The molecula...
