2025-08-20 00:19:52,411 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
• Energy and wavelength are inversely related
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (red/orange/yellow end of sp...
