Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
â–  D) 2.822 x 10^-26

2025-08-20 00:18:50,409 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
   - 13 identical charged particles
   - Each particle has charge 2e
   - 12 particles are constrained in a circle 2 m from point P
   - 1 particle is fixed at point P
   - We need to find the minimum energy configuration

2) Ele...
