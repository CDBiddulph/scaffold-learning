=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

2025-08-20 00:18:51,903 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum scattering theory, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts by the optical theorem.

2) Specifically, the imaginary part is given by the formula:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δl)

   Where:
   • k is the ...
