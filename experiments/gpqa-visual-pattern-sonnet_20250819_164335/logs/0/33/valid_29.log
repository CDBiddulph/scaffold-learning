Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
â–  D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-20 00:18:51,512 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the requirements:
- We need an optically active saturated hydrocarbon
- This means the molecule must have:
   a) A chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
   b) Contain only carbon and hydrogen
   c) Be fully saturated (no double/triple bonds)
