2025-08-20 00:18:51,336 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory):
- SMEFT is a framework for parametrizing possible new physics beyond the Standard Model
- Any operators in SMEFT must respect fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory

2. Analyzing Lorentz Symmetry ...
