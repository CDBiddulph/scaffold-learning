Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
â–  B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

2025-08-20 00:19:51,585 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First reaction (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)):
- This looks like a Claisen rearrangement
- The terminal alkene will shift and form a new carbon-oxygen bond
- Stereochemistry and mechanism suggest (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine
