=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
■ D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:25,130 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In Feynman diagram notation, the number of loops can be estimated by the power of the coupling constants and the dimensionality of the calculation.

2) The given expression has a few key components:
   • alpha^3: A coupling constant term
   • g^2: Another coupling constant
   • 1/(4pi)^6: A dimensionful factor

3) The general rule for loop counting is that each loop introduces an extra power of the coupling constant.

4) Let's count the powers of coupling constants:
   • alpha^3 suggests 3 powers from alpha
   • g^2 suggests 2 powers from g
   • Total coupling power is 5

5) Typically, each loop contributes one power of the coupling constant.

6) Therefore, the number of loops is 3.

7) This is consistent with the overall structure of the expression, which appears to describe a high-order quantum correction.

8) Checking our candidate answers, 3 loops corresponds to option D.
