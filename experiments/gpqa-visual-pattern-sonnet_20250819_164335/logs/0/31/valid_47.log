=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
■ D) No, there is no difference.

2025-08-20 00:17:27,701 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what Oblique Parameters are:
• These are parameters (S, T, U) that describe electroweak precision measurements
• They characterize potential new physics effects in the Standard Model without specifying the exact mechanism

2) Breit-Wigner corrections relate to the resonance behavior of particles
• They describe how particles' properties change near their mass shell
• Can provide additional nuanced information about particle interactions

3) In multi-Higgs-doublet models:
• The corrections can modify the original Oblique Parameters
• However, typically these modifications are subtle, not dramatically different

4) Research in this area suggests:
• Breit-Wigner corrections provide some additional constraint
• But they don't fundamentally change the physics constraint significantly
• The overall information content remains similar to the original parameters

5) Key point: The constraint level doesn't substantially improve

6) This suggests that there is essentially no significant difference between Oblique Parameters with and without Breit-Wigner corrections.

7) This directly points to option D: No, there is no difference.
