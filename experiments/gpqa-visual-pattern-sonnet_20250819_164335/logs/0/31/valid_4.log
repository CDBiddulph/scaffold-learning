=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
■ B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:25,137 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the problem:
   • Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
   • 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   • We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a conditional probability problem. The fact that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes affects our calculation.

3) Let's calculate the probability the atom has not decayed after 50 minutes:
   • Probability of decay by 100 minutes = 32%
   • Probability of no decay by 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 68%

4) By the properties of exponential decay, the probability of decay depends only on the remaining time.

5) We now want to find the probability of decay in the NEXT 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet

6) The relevant decay probability will be (1 - the probability it survives an additional 150 minutes)

7) Scaling the original probabilities:
   • If 32% decay by 100 minutes, then in 150 minutes the decay probability will be higher

8) Rough calculation: 32% × (150/100) = 48%

9) This approximation looks like our answer choice!

10) Looking at the choices, 48% corresponds to option A.
