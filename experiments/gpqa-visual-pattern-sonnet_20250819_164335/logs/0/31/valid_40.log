=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



■ D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-20 00:17:26,860 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the scenario:
   • Light is propagating through a moving glass
   • Glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
   • Light's speed in vacuum is c = 1
   • Glass has refractive index n

2) This problem requires understanding relativistic velocity addition.

3) In a moving medium, the speed of light is affected by two factors:
   • The refractive index of the medium (n)
   • The velocity of the medium (v)

4) The relativistic velocity addition formula for this scenario is:
   (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)*v)

5) Since c = 1, this becomes:
   (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)

6) Rearranging this:
   (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)
   = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) This matches option D: (1+n*v)/(n+v)

8) Let's verify the key conditions are met:
   • Accounts for medium's refractive index
   • Accounts for medium's motion
   • Uses relativistic velocity addition
