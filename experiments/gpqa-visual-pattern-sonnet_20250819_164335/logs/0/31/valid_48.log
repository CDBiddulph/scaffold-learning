=== INPUT ===
In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
■ C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:17:27,092 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Industrial Implementation:
- The first statement claims that combined catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization with branching are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
- This seems plausible, as industrial polymerization techniques are constantly evolving.

2. Catalyst Selection:
- Group VIa transition metals include chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten.
- These metals are known to be used in certain polymerization catalysts.
- The statement suggests such catalysts can be used with specific activators.

3. Activator Compatibility:
- The statement claims aluminum-based activators do not work for the additional reaction step.
- This implies that a different type of activator is required for introducing branches.

4. Noble Metal Catalysts:
- The statement suggests noble metal catalysts exist but are too expensive.
- Noble metals are often used in catalysis but can indeed be cost-prohibitive.

Comparing the statements:
- Statement A seems reasonable
- Statement B appears specific and precise
- Statement C appears technically sound
- Statement D is a pragmatic observation about catalyst economics

Based on the most technically precise and specific statement, the answer is most likely to be C, which discusses using a group VIa transition metal catalyst with specific activators.
