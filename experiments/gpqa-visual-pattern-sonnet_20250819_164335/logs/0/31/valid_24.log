=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

■ A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:30,155 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle type in 1e-5s

2) Distance = Speed * Time
   • For each particle: Distance = Speed * (1e-5s)

3) Relativistic length contraction will affect the distance traveled

4) Calculations:
   • Zeta (0.96c): 
     Distance = 0.96 * c * (1e-5) * γ
     γ = 1/√(1-(0.96)²) ≈ 2.857
     Distance ≈ 0.96 * 3e8 * (1e-5) * 2.857 ≈ 8,200m

   • Eta (0.9c):
     γ = 1/√(1-(0.9)²) ≈ 2.294
     Distance ≈ 0.9 * 3e8 * (1e-5) * 2.294 ≈ 6,200m

   • Chi (0.88c):
     γ = 1/√(1-(0.88)²) ≈ 2.143
     Distance ≈ 0.88 * 3e8 * (1e-5) * 2.143 ≈ 5,700m

   • Lambda (0.93c):
     γ = 1/√(1-(0.93)²) ≈ 2.569
     Distance ≈ 0.93 * 3e8 * (1e-5) * 2.569 ≈ 7,200m

5) Comparing these distances from greatest to least:
   Zeta (8,200m) > Lambda (7,200m) > Eta (6,200m) > Chi (5,700m)

6) This matches option B.
