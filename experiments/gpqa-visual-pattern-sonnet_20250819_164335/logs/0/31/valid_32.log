=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

■ A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-20 00:16:28,979 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the system:
   • [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M
   • [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
   • pH = 1.0
   • [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
   • K complex = 10^21 for Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex

2) The Nernst equation will help us calculate the redox potential:
   E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln(Reduced/Oxidized)
   Where E0 = 0.77 V

3) Some of the Fe(III) will form a complex with H2PO4^-:
   Fe(III) + H2PO4^- ⇌ Fe(III)-H2PO4^-
   With a very high complex formation constant (10^21)

4) This means most of the Fe(III) will be complexed, reducing the free Fe(III) concentration

5) The Nernst equation with log terms:
   E = 0.77 - (0.059/1) * log([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

6) However, the [Fe(III)] is significantly reduced due to complexation

7) This complexation shifts the redox potential to a lower value

8) From the given options and reasoning, the most likely answer is 0.26 V
