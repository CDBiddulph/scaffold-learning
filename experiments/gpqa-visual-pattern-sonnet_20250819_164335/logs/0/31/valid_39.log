=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
â–  D) At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-20 00:17:26,820 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scenario involves ChIP-seq peaks that disappear when the crosslinking method changes from PFA to PFA+DSG.

2. This suggests the disappearing peaks are sensitive to the specific crosslinking method.

3. Crosslinking techniques impact protein-DNA interactions differently:
- PFA alone is good for capturing transient/weak interactions
- PFA+DSG provides more stringent/stable crosslinking

4. Transcription factors like IKAROS typically bind most stably to:
- Actively regulated genomic regions
- Sites with high transcriptional activity
- Regions with open chromatin

5. Active promoters and enhancers are characterized by:
- High transcription factor binding
- Open chromatin structure
- Dynamic protein interactions
- Sensitive to crosslinking conditions

6. These regions would be most likely to show peak differences between crosslinking methods due to their transient and dynamic nature.

7. Other genomic regions like random locations, repeats, or gene introns are less likely to show such sensitive peak changes.

Therefore, the most likely location for these disappearing peaks is active promoters and enhancers.
