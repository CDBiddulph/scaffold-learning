2025-08-20 00:16:26,249 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for black hole entropy:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the area of the event horizon, and l_p is the Planck length

2) The angular size θ relates to the radius of the event horizon at the given distance:
   θ = 2R/d
   Where R is the radius of the event horizon, d is the distance

3) Rearranging this: R = (θ * d)/2
   R = (10^-17 * 10^10) / 2
   R = 10^-7 parsecs

4) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec = 3.086 * 10^16 meters
   R = 10^-7 * 3.086 * 10^16 = 3.086 * 10^9 meters

5) Event horizon area: A = 4πR²
   A = 4π * (3.086 * 10^9)² ≈ 10^20 m²

6) Plugging into Bekenstein-Hawking formula:
   S ≈ (10^-23 * 10^20) / (10^-35)²
     ≈ 10^62 J/K

7) This corresponds to option C.
