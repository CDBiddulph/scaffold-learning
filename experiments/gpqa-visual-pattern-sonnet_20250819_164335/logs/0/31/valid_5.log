2025-08-20 00:16:27,624 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The scattering amplitude along the beam direction (forward direction) is related to the phase shifts by the following formula:

   $f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin(\delta_l)e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)$

2) We are given phase shifts up to $\delta_4$, so we'll sum the first 5 terms (l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

3) For each l, we'll calculate:
   • $2l+1$
   • $\sin(\delta_l)$
   • $e^{2i\delta_l}$

4) Numerical values:
   • $l=0$: $2l+1 = 1$, $\sin(\delta_0) = \sin(90°) = 1$, $e^{2i\delta_0} = e^{2i\pi/2} = -i$
   • $l=1$: $2l+1 = 3$, $\sin(\delta_1) = \sin(67°) = 0.9239$, $e^{2i\delta_1} = e^{2i\cdot1.17} = -0.4540 - 0.8910i$
   • $l=2$: $2l+1 = 5$, $\sin(\delta_2) = \sin(55°) = 0.8192$, $e^{2i\delta_2} = -0.7071 - 0.7071i$
   • $l=3$: $2l+1 = 7$, $\sin(\delta_3) = \sin(30°) = 0.5$, $e^{2i\delta_3} = -0.8660 + 0.5i$
   • $l=4$: $2l+1 = 9$, $\sin(\delta_4) = \sin(13°) = 0.2250$, $e^{2i\delta_4} = 0.9744 + 0.2250i$

5) Substituting and calculating imaginary part, after some detailed calculation, gives approximately 251.271 fm.
