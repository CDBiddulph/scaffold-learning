=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-20 00:17:27,169 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   • Energy ∝ Temperature

2) Peak photon energy for star A: 7.21 eV
   Peak photon energy for sun: 1.41 eV
   Temperature ratio = 7.21/1.41 = 5.12

3) Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:
   L ∝ R²T⁴
   Where L is luminosity, R is radius, T is temperature

4) We know star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

5) Let's write an equation:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² * (5.12)⁴

6) Rearrange to solve for R/R_sun:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² * (5.12)⁴
   √(24 / (5.12)⁴) = R/R_sun

7) Calculate:
   R/R_sun = √(24 / (5.12)⁴)
           = √(24 / (268.44))
           = √(0.089)
           = 0.19

8) This corresponds to option B.
