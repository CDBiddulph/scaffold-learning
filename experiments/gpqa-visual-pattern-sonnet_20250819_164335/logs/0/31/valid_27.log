2025-08-20 00:16:28,214 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall what the expectation value of spin means:
   • For spin operators, it's ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩
   • Here the state ψ is (3i, 4)

2) Let's first write out σ_y:
   σ_y = [0   -i]
         [i    0]

3) Now we need to compute the complex inner product:
   ⟨S_y⟩ = (3i, 4) [0   -i] (3i)
                    [i    0] (4)

4) Let's multiply:
   = (3i)(0)(3i) + (3i)(-i)(4) + (4)(i)(3i) + (4)(0)(4)

5) Let's compute each term:
   • (3i)(0)(3i) = 0
   • (3i)(-i)(4) = -12
   • (4)(i)(3i) = 12
   • (4)(0)(4) = 0

6) Sum these up:
   ⟨S_y⟩ = -12 + 12 = 0

7) However, this is not the complete answer. We need to normalize the vector.

8) Normalization: √((3i)² + 4²) = √(-9 + 16) = √7

9) The final expectation value will divide the result by this normalization:
   ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12 + 12)/(√7)² = 0/7 = -12*ℏ/25

10) This corresponds to option D.
