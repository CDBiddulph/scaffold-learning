You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-20 00:17:26,548 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the expression vector's multiple cloning site (MCS):
• Contains HindIII and KpnI sites
• We want to ensure directional cloning

2. Analyze the enzyme options and primer sequences:
• The primers are adding restriction enzyme sites to the PCR product
• We want to match MCS sites for proper orientation

3. Primer requirements:
• Forward primer should add a site that allows correct orientation
• Reverse primer should add a complementary site
• Start and stop codons should be preserved

4. Evaluating the options:
• Option A uses HindIII at the start and KpnI at the end
• This matches the vector's HindIII and KpnI sites
• The primers preserve the start (ATG) and stop codons
• The sites will ensure correct orientation during cloning

5. Verifying other details:
• HindIII site on forward primer (aaaaaagctt)
• KpnI site on reverse primer (aaaggtacc)
• The added restriction sites flank the gene sequence

These considerations point to Option A as the correct choice.
