=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

■ A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:17:26,703 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Problem:
- The student is trying to increase the conversion rate of a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction
- Current reaction conditions: 300°C
- Previous attempts to change catalyst amount/composition did not improve conversion

2. Consider Temperature Effects:
- In most chemical reactions, increasing temperature can:
   a) Improve reaction kinetics
   b) Shift equilibrium towards products
   c) Enhance reaction conversion

3. Catalyst Considerations:
- The student has already tried changing catalyst amount without success
- Decreasing catalyst amount is unlikely to help conversion

4. Warning Signs:
- The student is warned about potential polymerization of a product
- This suggests temperature sensitivity of the reaction products

5. Analyzing Options:
- Option A is defeatist and not recommended
- Option B lacks consideration of polymerization risk
- Option C recognizes polymerization risk and suggests a careful approach
- Option D suggests counterintuitive changes (increasing temperature and decreasing catalyst)

6. Recommendation:
- Carefully decrease temperature to reduce polymerization risk
- Increase catalyst amount to potentially improve conversion
- Option C best captures this approach
