=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

■ D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-20 00:16:26,243 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the scenario:
- Scientist injected Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA into a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The embryo was carried to full term
- Different tissues have different genomes

2. Analyzing possible causes:

A) cDNA conversion and incorporation:
- This is unlikely because the scenario mentions mRNA, not DNA
- Random DNA integration would be less precise than targeted CRISPR editing

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex integration:
- This is not a typical mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 editing
- The guide RNA is used for targeting, not for integration

C) Surrogate mother's DNA introduction:
- This is highly improbable and not a mechanism related to CRISPR editing
- DNA transfer between mother and embryo is not a standard biological process

D) Continuous DNA cutting and donor DNA incorporation:
- During early embryonic development, cells divide rapidly
- If Cas9 continues to cut DNA at different stages, each cell might have a slightly different editing outcome
- This could lead to mosaicism, where different cells have different genomes

3. Conclusion:
The most probable cause is the continuous action of Cas9, leading to different genomic modifications at different stages of embryo development.
