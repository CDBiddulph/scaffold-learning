=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
■ B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:23,651 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what happened in the reaction:
• The students started with 10 g of benzoic acid
• They heated it in ethanol with an acid catalyst
• The TLC showed A = three spots (typically: starting material, product, and solvent)

2) After separation via column chromatography:
• They recovered 4 g of product
• They recovered 3 g of starting material

3) Calculate the percentage yield:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%
• Theoretical yield is the starting material mass (10 g)
• Actual yield is the product mass (4 g)

4) Calculation:
• Percentage yield = (4 g / 10 g) × 100%
• Percentage yield = 0.4 × 100%
• Percentage yield = 40%

5) However, the question asks for the percentage as a decimal multiplied by 100%:
• 40% = 40.00%
• The closest option is 44.44%

6) From the given options, this corresponds to option C.
