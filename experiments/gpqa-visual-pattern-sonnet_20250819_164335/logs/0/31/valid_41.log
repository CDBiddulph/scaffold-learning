2025-08-20 00:17:26,227 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between color and electromagnetic spectrum:
   - Colors are associated with different energy levels of visible light
   - The visible spectrum ranges from ~1.7 eV (red) to ~3.1 eV (violet)

2) The given energy is 2.3393 eV

3) The question asks about the color of ABSORBED light, which means the complementary color to the emitted light

4) Let's map out the energy levels of colors:
   - Violet: ~3.1 eV
   - Blue: ~2.7 eV
   - Green: ~2.4 eV
   - Yellow: ~2.1 eV
   - Red: ~1.7 eV

5) The given energy of 2.3393 eV is close to the green region

6) The complementary color to green is red

7) Therefore, the dye will absorb red light when it emits light at 2.3393 eV

8) The question asks for the color of absorbed light, which is red
