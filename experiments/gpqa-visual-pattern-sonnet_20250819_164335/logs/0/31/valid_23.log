a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-20 00:16:29,762 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log(distance/10 parsecs)

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) 7 mag at 50 parsecs
   • 5 log(50/10) = 5 log(5) = 5 * 0.7 = 3.5
   • This means its absolute magnitude would be around 3.5 mag

b) 7 mag at 20 parsecs
   • 5 log(20/10) = 5 log(2) = 5 * 0.3 = 1.5
   • This means its absolute magnitude would be around 5.5 mag

c) Two stars at 5 parsecs
   • Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8
   • At 5 parsecs, each star appears brighter than at a greater distance
   • Combined apparent brightness would be even brighter

d) Absolute magnitude of 7 at 10 parsecs
   • By definition, this star has apparent magnitude of 7 mag

e) Two stars at 10 parsecs
   • Absolute magnitudes: Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8
   • Apparent magnitude will be brighter than absolute magnitude

f) Two equal stars at 10 parsecs
   • Absolute magnitudes: Both Vmag = 7
   • Combined apparent magnitude will be brighter than individual stars

3) Comparing these, option (f) will have the brightest apparent magnitude.
