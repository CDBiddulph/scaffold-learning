2025-08-20 00:16:24,681 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what happens in a reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI:
• This typically results in complete reduction and deiodination
• The molecule will be converted to a fully saturated structure
• Reduction occurs at both the aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups
• Double bonds will be saturated

2) Let's count the initial structural features of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid:
• One double bond in the ring
• One vinyl group (double bond)
• One aldehyde group
• One carboxylic acid group

3) After reduction, these become:
• No double bonds (all saturated)
• Replaced vinyl group with -CH2CH3
• Reduced aldehyde to -CH2OH
• Reduced carboxylic acid to -CH2OH

4) Index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) calculation:
• IHD = Number of rings + Number of double bonds
• In the reduced product: 1 ring, 0 double bonds
• IHD = 1 + 0 = 1

5) Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.
