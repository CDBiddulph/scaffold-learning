=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

■ A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-20 00:16:28,285 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The problem states that the wave function is:
   - Time independent
   - Spherically symmetric
   - Has no imaginary part
   - Results in equal probabilities for specific radial ranges

2) Probability of finding a particle is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2

3) The probability is proportional to the volume of the spherical shell multiplied by |Ψ(r)|^2

4) Volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr

5) We know that P is the same for two ranges:
   - Between d1 and 2*d1
   - Between 2*d1 and 3*d1

6) For this to be true, |Ψ(r)|^2 must be proportional to 1/r^2

7) This means Ψ(r) must be proportional to 1/r

8) The physical interpretation is that the wave function behaves as 1/r to ensure equal probabilities in shells with different volumes

9) Checking the options, 1/r matches this reasoning
