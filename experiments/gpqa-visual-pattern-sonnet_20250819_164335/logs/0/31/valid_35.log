=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


â–  A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:28,685 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C analysis characteristics:
- Large cell population (50M cells)
- Strong interaction signal between promoter and enhancer
- Separated by ~1 Mb linear distance
- dCas9-KRAB targeting enhancer reduces promoter expression by 20%

2. FISH validation considerations:
- Failed to confirm the Hi-C interaction
- Potential reasons for discrepancy

3. Analysis of each option:
A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
- Hi-C signal was highly significant
- dCas9-KRAB effect suggests functional interaction exists
- This could explain FISH validation failure

B) Structural variation affecting distance
- No evidence provided suggesting structural variation
- Less likely explanation

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH
- 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH
- Not a compelling explanation

D) Hi-C false-positive signal
- Hi-C was done with large cell population
- Functional evidence from dCas9-KRAB experiment supports interaction
- Less likely to be completely false

4. Conclusion:
Option A best explains the inconsistency - the interaction might be present but too weak/infrequent for FISH detection.
