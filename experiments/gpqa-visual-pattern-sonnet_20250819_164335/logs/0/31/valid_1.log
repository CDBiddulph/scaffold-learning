=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:24,899 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Half-life of Caesium-137
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years (about 15.7 million minutes)
• In 80 minutes, the decay is minimal - essentially the full number of atoms will be considered

2) Decay constant and activity
• Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life
• Activity = Number of atoms × decay constant
• λ ≈ 0.693 / (15.7 × 10^6) minutes^-1
• Activity = 10^17 × λ

3) Gamma-ray emission per decay
• Cs-137 typically emits about 0.85 gamma-rays per decay

4) Solid angle calculation
• Detector area = 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance = 4 meters = 400 cm
• Solid angle = (Detector area) / (4πr²)
• ≈ (6) / (4π × 400²) steradians

5) Putting it all together
• Estimated gamma-rays = Activity × Solid angle × Time × Gamma-rays per decay
• This calculation points to around 10^6 gamma-rays
