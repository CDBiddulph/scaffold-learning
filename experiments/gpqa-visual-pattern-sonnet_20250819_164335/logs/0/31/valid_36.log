=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

■ A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:29,594 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand "low Earth orbit":
• This means satellites very close to Earth
• Typically around 160-2,000 km above Earth's surface
• Detecting objects from this proximity affects observable range and precision

2. Localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes:
• This is a relatively broad measurement range
• Suggests detecting objects that are not extremely close or extremely far

3. Isotropic distribution:
• Objects are uniformly spread across all directions
• Implies the objects could be at various distances

4. Analyze the options:
A) 1 million/1 billion light years - Too far for low Earth orbit detection
B) 1,000/100,000 light years - Within our galaxy's scale, reasonable detection range
C) 10/100 light years - Very close, within our solar neighborhood
D) 10 light minutes/100 light seconds - Too close, within solar system

5. Reasoning:
• Option B provides the most plausible range for astronomical object detection
• Spans distances within the Milky Way galaxy
• Consistent with low Earth orbit satellite capabilities
