=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
■ C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-20 00:16:23,315 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the conditions of the C-NOT gate with the condition that the first qubit is |0⟩:
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, no change occurs
   • If the control qubit would be |1⟩, a NOT gate is applied to the target qubit

2) Looking at the input state:
   |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

3) The first part (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) is in the first qubit, and the second part is |0⟩

4) Since the first qubit is |0⟩, the C-NOT gate will NOT change anything

5) This means the output will be exactly the same as the input:
   U_{C-NOT}|ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

6) Looking at the options, this matches option A exactly
