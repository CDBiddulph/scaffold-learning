=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
■ C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-20 00:16:24,875 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV light
• This suggests a photochemical reaction
• Since the molecular weight remains the same, likely a rearrangement/structural change
• The most probable reaction is a photochemical Norrish type II cleavage
• This would form a ketyl radical intermediate

2) After UV irradiation, the resulting product 1 is hydrogenated with Pd/C and H2
• This suggests reduction of the radical structure
• Pd/C with H2 will selectively reduce radicals to saturated structures

3) The final product 2 will be a fully saturated bicyclic ketone

4) In the 1H NMR spectrum of this molecule:
• The most deshielded hydrogen will likely be near the ketone
• This hydrogen would likely have complex coupling with neighboring hydrogens
• This suggests a doublet of doublets splitting pattern

5) Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2 would appear as a doublet of doublets
