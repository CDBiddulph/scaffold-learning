=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

■ A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:28,913 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the context:
• We have two point particles
• They are separated by 137 meters
• They experience an attractive and a repulsive force

2) The key insight is likely about the fundamental forces:
• The attractive force is likely gravitational
• The repulsive force is likely electromagnetic (electrostatic)

3) The force strengths will depend on their distance according to their respective laws:
• Gravitational force: F = G(m1*m2)/r²
• Electromagnetic force: F = k(q1*q2)/r²

4) At the fundamental scale, the electron charge (e) and Planck mass are often used as "smallest" units

5) Key physics constants are relevant:
• Gravitational constant G
• Coulomb's constant k
• Electron charge e
• Planck mass m_P

6) The ratio of electromagnetic to gravitational force at this distance would be significant

7) The distance of 137 meters suggests a specific relationship

8) This hints at the fine structure constant (α), which is approximately 1/137

9) In fact, the ratio would likely be 1/137
