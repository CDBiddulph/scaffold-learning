=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
â–  D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-20 00:16:28,602 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Requirements for optically active molecules:
- Must have a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- Requires at least one carbon with 4 different substituents

2) Optically active hydrocarbons are typically branched or cyclic with asymmetric carbons

3) Let's analyze the molecular formulas from mass spectra:
A) m/z = 72: Likely C5H12
B) m/z = 86: Likely C6H14
C) m/z = 58: Likely C4H10
D) m/z = 100: Likely C7H16

4) Candidates for optical activity need a carbon with 4 different groups
- Best candidates are branched isomers

5) For m/z = 86 (C6H14), the isomer 2-methylpentane has a chiral center
- It meets requirements for optical activity
- Percentage composition is close to data set B

6) Set B has:
- Correct molecular formula
- Matches typical hydrocarbon mass spectrum pattern
- Potential for optical activity
