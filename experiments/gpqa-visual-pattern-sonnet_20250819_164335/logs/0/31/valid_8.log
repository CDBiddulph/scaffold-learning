2025-08-20 00:16:25,698 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) We know the equilibrium constant (K) is 5 × 10¹⁰ and the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.

3) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that dissociate.

4) The equilibrium equation is:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

5) Since K is very large, we can assume x will be very small compared to 0.02.
   So, (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02

6) Rearranging the equation:
   x² = (5 × 10¹⁰)(0.02)
   x = √((5 × 10¹⁰)(0.02))

7) Calculate x:
   x = √(1 × 10¹⁰)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

8) This matches option B.
