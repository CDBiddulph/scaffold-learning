=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
■ B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:25,398 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas and NMR data:
• A (C6H13Br): Suggests a bromoalkane
• B (C4H6): Suggests an alkyne
• C (C10H18): Result of combining A and B

2. NMR signal analysis:
• The number of signals indicates structural complexity
• The compounds have different characteristic signal patterns

3. Reaction type considerations:
• Bromoalkanes can participate in nucleophilic substitution
• Alkynes can act as nucleophiles

4. Evaluate each option:
• Option A: Addition doesn't match substitution mechanism
• Option B: Describes a nucleophilic substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
• Option C: Electrophilic substitution is unlikely for this system
• Option D: Different reactants from the given molecular formulas

5. Reasoning for Option B:
• Nucleophilic substitution can occur between the bromoalkane and alkyne
• The product (7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne) matches the molecular formula C10H18
• NMR signal complexity is consistent
