All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
■ B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-20 00:16:27,102 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) This statement discusses the frameshifting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. The description of the pseudoknot conformations and their relationship to frameshifting rates appears to be scientifically sound and consistent with current research.

B) This statement describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. The description suggests that nsp10 and nsp14 form a heterodimer involved in mismatch repair, with nsp14's ExoN domain playing a key role in preventing RNA degradation. This aligns with current understanding of the viral RNA proofreading mechanism.

C) This statement explains the role of ORF3a in apoptosis. It describes how ORF3a can activate caspase-8 without affecting Bcl-2 levels, suggesting an extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This mechanism of viral-induced apoptosis is plausible and consistent with molecular virology principles.

D) This statement discusses programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a potential issue here. While the mechanism of frameshifting is described correctly, the claim that SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting "mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting" may not be entirely accurate.

Recent research has shown that while there are similarities, there are also subtle differences in the frameshifting mechanisms between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The conformations and efficiency of frameshifting can vary between these closely related coronaviruses.

Therefore, statement D appears to be the least accurate or potentially misleading.
