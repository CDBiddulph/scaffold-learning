2025-08-20 00:16:24,951 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Lorentz symmetry:
• This is fundamental to the Standard Model and effective field theories
• Must be respected by construction
• This means ALL interactions must be consistent with Lorentz transformations

2) Poincaré symmetry:
• This is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry plus spacetime translations
• Also fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
• Must be respected in the SMEFT

3) CP symmetry:
• This is not necessarily preserved in the SMEFT
• The Standard Model allows CP violation
• SMEFT can include CP-violating operators
• So CP symmetry is NOT required

4) CPT symmetry:
• A fundamental quantum field theory symmetry
• Theoretically required by axiomatic quantum field theory
• Must be respected by any consistent effective field theory

Checking the list:
• Lorentz symmetry ✓
• Poincaré symmetry ✓
• CP symmetry ✗
• CPT symmetry ✓

This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.
