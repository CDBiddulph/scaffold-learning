S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
■ D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-20 00:16:25,323 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (TBS protection):
- The hydroxyl group of the starting material is protected with TBS chloride
- This converts the hydroxyl to a TBS ether, making it unreactive

2) Second reaction (Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide):
- Ph2CuLi is a nucleophilic reagent that adds to the α,β-unsaturated ketone
- Benzyl bromide then alkylates the copper intermediate
- This adds a phenyl group and a benzyl group to the molecule

3) Third reaction (LDA and iodomethane):
- LDA deprotonates the α-carbon
- Iodomethane then alkylates this enolate
- This adds a methyl group to the α-carbon

4) Final reaction (aqueous HCl):
- This removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the hydroxyl group
- The final structure has a hydroxyl group, a phenyl group, a benzyl group, and a methyl group

Comparing the stereochemistry and substitution pattern with the given options, the structure matches option D.
