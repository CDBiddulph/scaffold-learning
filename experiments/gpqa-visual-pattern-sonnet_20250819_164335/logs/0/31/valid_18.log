The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
■ B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:24,747 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney equation:
• It describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
• It assumes a single-carrier device
• It requires specific contact and carrier transport conditions

2. Examining the conditions in the equation:
• Single-carrier: The equation considers only one type of charge carrier
• No carrier injection barrier: Carriers should be able to freely enter the device
• Negligible diffusion current: Current is dominated by drift current
• Trap-free: No significant charge trapping in the semiconductor

3. Let's analyze each option:
A) Mentions an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current (incorrect)
B) Mentions no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current (matches key requirements)
C) Mentions a Schottky contact, which would introduce a carrier injection barrier (incorrect)
D) Mentions a two-carrier device, which contradicts the single-carrier assumption (incorrect)

4. Option B precisely describes the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation:
• No carrier injection barrier allows free carrier entry
• Negligible diffusion current means drift current dominates
• Single-carrier assumption is maintained

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
