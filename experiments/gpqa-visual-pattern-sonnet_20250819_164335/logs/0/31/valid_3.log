b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

■ A) c
B) a
C) b
D) d

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:24,522 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between mass, radius, and density:
   Density = Mass / Volume
   Density ∝ Mass / (Radius)³

2) Case a) - An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
   • This would have the same density as Earth
   • Earth's density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³

3) Case b) - 2 Earth masses with density of 5.5 g/cm³:
   • This suggests a different structure than Earth
   • If it maintains the same density, its radius would increase proportionally to its mass

4) Case c) - Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive:
   • Density would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm³
   • Volume would increase proportionally to mass
   • Radius would increase, but not as much as mass

5) Case d) - Same composition as Earth, half the mass:
   • Density would still be 5.5 g/cm³
   • Volume would decrease proportionally
   • Radius would be smaller

6) Comparing these cases, the density remains constant at 5.5 g/cm³ for cases a, c, and d.

7) The planet with the highest density is the one with the same density.
