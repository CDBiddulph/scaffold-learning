Anthracene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate were combined in a 1:1 ratio and allowed to react at elevated temperature, yielding product 1. 1 was collected, and then heated with excess aqueous sodium hydroxide, to form dicarboxylic acid product 2 (after acidic workup). 2 was dissolved in trifluoroacetic anhydride and heated under reflux, converting the dicarboxylic acid to a 5-membered cyclic anhydride, compound 3. 3 was treated at high temperature with another equivalent of anthracene, yielding compound 4. what is the molecular symmetry group of compound 4?

A) Cs
B) C2
C) C2v
D) C1
