In a quantum dialog protocol a 4-mode continuous variable GHZ state is distributed among 3-parties, and a bell measurement is performed on these states, what would be the measurement output if the three parties encode in the following way using a displacement operator D(alpha): 
P1: (xa,pa) 
P2: (xb,pb)
P3: (xc,pc)
Here, (x,p) correspond to the amplitude and phase, such that 
alpha= x +ip, is the argument of displacement operator.
In the scheme, the 2nd and 3rd mode are encoded by P2. The 1st and 4th mode are encoded by P1 and P3.

A) (xa +xb,pa +pb), (xb+xc,pb+pc)
B) (xa -xb,pa -pb), (xb-xc,pb-pc)
C) (xa -xb,pa +pb), (xb-xc,pb+pc)
D) (xa +xb,pa -pb), (xb+xc,pb-pc)
