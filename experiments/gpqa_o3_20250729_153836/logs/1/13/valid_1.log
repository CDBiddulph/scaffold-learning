Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Cs-137 is a radioactive isotope that decays by emitting beta and gamma rays.

2. The decay constant of Cs-137 is approximately 0.0231 per year.

3. The number of atoms is 10^17, which is a large number.

4. In 80 minutes (which is about 0.152 years), the decay will be significant.

5. The decay rate will depend on the half-life and the number of atoms.

6. The total decay activity will result in around 10^6 gamma-ray emissions in this time period.

7. The detector is directly facing the material and is a reasonable size.

8. Considering efficiency and detector characteristics, about 1 million gamma-rays would be detected.

9. This matches option C, which is 1 million (10^6).
