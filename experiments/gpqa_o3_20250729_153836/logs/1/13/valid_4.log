We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) Initially, the decay probability within 100 minutes was 32%.

2) 50 minutes have already passed without decay. This means the atom has survived the first half of the original timeframe.

3) In probability, this means the probability of decay after 50 minutes is lower than the original 32%.

4) We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given the atom has already survived the first 50 minutes.

5) This is a conditional probability problem involving exponential decay.

6) The fact that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes means the remaining decay probability is adjusted.

7) Calculations show that the conditional probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is around 44%.

8) This matches option B.
