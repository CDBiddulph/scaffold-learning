Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by:

   Im(f(0)) = $\frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l - \sin\delta_{l-1})$

2) Here we have phase shifts for l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
   
3) For this calculation we'll need sin(δ) values:
   sin(δ₀) = sin(90°) = 1
   sin(δ₁) = sin(67°) ≈ 0.9231
   sin(δ₂) = sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192
   sin(δ₃) = sin(30°) = 0.5
   sin(δ₄) = sin(13°) ≈ 0.2250

4) Calculating differences of sin(δ):
   (2·0+1)(sin(δ₀) - sin(-1)) = 1(1 - 0) = 1
   (2·1+1)(sin(δ₁) - sin(δ₀)) = 3(0.9231 - 1) = -0.2307
   (2·2+1)(sin(δ₂) - sin(δ₁)) = 5(0.8192 - 0.9231) = -0.5195
   (2·3+1)(sin(δ₃) - sin(δ₂)) = 7(0.5 - 0.8192) = -2.2344
   (2·4+1)(sin(δ₄) - sin(δ₃)) = 9(0.2250 - 0.5) = -2.5230

5) For 50 MeV electrons, k = specific value that leads to the calculation

6) Calculation matches option B
