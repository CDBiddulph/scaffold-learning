Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is mass divided by volume.

2. For a planet with the same composition, the density remains constant regardless of total mass.

3. Option a) is an Earth-like planet with standard Earth density.

4. Option b) has a specific density of 5.5 g/cm^3, which is different from Earth's density.

5. Option c) has the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Since composition is unchanged, density would be the same as Earth's.

6. Option d) has the same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, density remains constant.

7. Comparing the options, option c) has the same density as Earth but is larger in mass and volume.

8. However, density is a constant for a given composition, so mass changes don't affect density.

9. All options with the same composition have the same density.

10. The only option standing out is option b) with its specific density of 5.5 g/cm^3.
