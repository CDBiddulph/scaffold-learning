trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D) 11

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 22:59:19,510 [DEBUG] Raw LLM response:
Let's solve this step by step:

1) Start with trans-cinnamaldehyde: This molecule has 9 carbons originally.

2) Treating with methylmagnesium bromide adds a methyl group: Now the molecule has 10 carbons.

3) Treating with pyridinium chlorochromate oxidizes the alcohol to a ketone: Still 10 carbons.

4) The final reaction with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO adds another carbon.

5) Counting carbons in the final product: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons.
