What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1) The reaction is: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA] = 5 × 10¹⁰

3) Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA = 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of dissociated Ca²⁺ ions

5) Using the equilibrium expression:
   KCa-EDTA = x² / (0.02 - x)

6) Rearranging: 
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

7) Since KCa-EDTA is very large, x will be small compared to 0.02

8) Approximating: 
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / 0.02

9) Solving for x:
   x = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

10) This matches option B.
