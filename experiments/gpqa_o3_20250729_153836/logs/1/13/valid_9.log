2025-07-29 22:59:40,157 [DEBUG] Raw LLM response:
Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, I'll analyze the initial molecule 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
   - Contains a cyclic structure
   - Has a vinyl group
   - Has an aldehyde (formyl) group
   - Has a carboxylic acid group

2) When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI:
   - This is a reducing reaction
   - Will likely reduce the aldehyde group to an alcohol
   - Will likely reduce the vinyl group
   - Will likely reduce any double bonds

3) The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) measures the total number of rings and double bonds in a molecule

4) After reduction:
   - The ring remains
   - No double bonds left
   - All functional groups reduced to single-bonded groups

5) Calculating IHD:
   - Original structure likely had 1 ring
   - Lost all double bonds
   - Thus, IHD will be 1

6) Checking the options, 1 corresponds to option D.
