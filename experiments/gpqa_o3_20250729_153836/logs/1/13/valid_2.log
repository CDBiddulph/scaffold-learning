In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's examine the number of spots under UV light:
- The question says the students found A spots, where A is either two or three
- With TLC, typical spots include starting material, product, and solvent
- This suggests A is two or three spots

2. Now let's calculate the percentage yield:
- They started with 10 g of benzoic acid
- They recovered 4 g of product and 3 g of starting material
- Total product formation appears to be 4 g
- Percentage yield calculation: (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%
- In this case, that would be: (4 g / Total theoretical maximum) × 100%

3. The data suggests the percentage yield is 66.66%

4. Cross-referencing the conditions:
- A = two spots
- B = 66.66% yield

5. This matches option B
