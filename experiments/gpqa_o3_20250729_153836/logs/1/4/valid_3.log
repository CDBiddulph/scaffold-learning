Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume.

2. Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have exactly Earth's density, which is about 5.5 g/cm³.

3. Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and 5.5 g/cm³ density suggests a smaller volume than Earth. This might indicate some compression or different internal structure.

4. Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive would have the same density (5.5 g/cm³) but a much larger volume. The increased mass would be proportional to the increased volume.

5. Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass would likely have the same density as Earth (5.5 g/cm³), just with half the volume.

6. Comparing the densities:
   - Option a: 5.5 g/cm³
   - Option b: 5.5 g/cm³
   - Option c: 5.5 g/cm³
   - Option d: 5.5 g/cm³

7. Since all options have the same density, we need a tiebreaker. Option c has the largest mass.

8. Larger mass under same composition typically indicates higher gravitational compression, which could suggest a slightly higher effective density.
