Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

Let's solve this step by step:

1. For the first reaction (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)):
- This involves a Claisen-type rearrangement
- The pi bond will migrate
- This produces (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine
- This matches option B and D's first product

2. For the second reaction ((3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat):
- This is likely a Cope rearrangement
- The terminal alkynes will rearrange
- Produces (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene
- This matches option B and D's second product

3. For the third reaction (2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat):
- Will produce an aldehyde via sigmatropic rearrangement
- The product is 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
- This matches option C and D's third product

4. Comparing the details, option D perfectly matches all three products.
