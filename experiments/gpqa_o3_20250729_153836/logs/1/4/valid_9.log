Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) represents:
   - IHD = Number of rings + Number of double bonds/2

2) Let's look at the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
   - It has one cyclohexene ring
   - It has one double bond in the ring
   - It has one vinyl group (another double bond)

3) Red phosphorus and HI typically reduce molecules, breaking double bonds and converting them to single bonds

4) After reduction:
   - The ring remains
   - Both double bonds (ring and vinyl) will be converted to single bonds
   - The vinyl group becomes an ethyl group
   - Formyl and carboxylic groups remain

5) Counting rings: 1 ring
   Counting double bonds: 0 (all reduced to single bonds)

6) Calculating IHD:
   IHD = 1 + 0/2 = 1

7) Cross-checking the options, 1 corresponds to option D.
