Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the key facts about Caesium-137 (Cs-137):
   - Half-life is about 30 years
   - Emits beta and gamma radiation
   - Each radioactive decay emits a gamma ray

2) Calculate the decay probability in 80 minutes:
   - Half-life = 30 years ≈ 15.8 million minutes
   - In 80 minutes, a tiny fraction of atoms will decay

3) Decay calculation:
   - Total atoms = 10^17
   - Decay probability = 80 / (15.8 × 10^6) ≈ 5 × 10^-6
   - Expected number of decays = 10^17 × (5 × 10^-6) ≈ 5 × 10^11 gamma rays

4) Detector considerations:
   - Detector size: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
   - Distance: 4 meters
   - Solid angle and detection efficiency will reduce the number

5) Estimating detected gamma rays:
   - Roughly 1 in 10,000 to 100,000 gamma rays will be detected
   - This suggests around 10^6 to 10^7 gamma rays detected

6) Looking at the options, this points to option C: 1 million (10^6)
