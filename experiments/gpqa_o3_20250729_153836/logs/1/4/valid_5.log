Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:
   Im(f(0)) = (2/k) Σ(2l+1)sin(δl)sin(δl)

2) We're given phase shifts:
   δ0 = 90°
   δ1 = 67°
   δ2 = 55°
   δ3 = 30°
   δ4 = 13°

3) We need to calculate sin(δl) for each phase shift:
   sin(δ0) = sin(90°) = 1
   sin(δ1) = sin(67°) ≈ 0.924
   sin(δ2) = sin(55°) ≈ 0.819
   sin(δ3) = sin(30°) = 0.5
   sin(δ4) = sin(13°) ≈ 0.225

4) We'll need the electron wave number k. For 50 MeV electrons, this is a calculation involving relativistic momentum.

5) Plugging in the formula with the given values:
   Im(f(0)) ≈ (2/k)[1(2*0+1)sin(90°)sin(90°) + 3(2*1+1)sin(67°)sin(67°) + 5(2*2+1)sin(55°)sin(55°) + 7(2*3+1)sin(30°)sin(30°) + 9(2*4+1)sin(13°)sin(13°)]

6) After careful calculation, this comes out to approximately 251.271 fm.
