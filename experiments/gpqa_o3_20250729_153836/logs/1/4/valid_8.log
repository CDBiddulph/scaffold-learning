Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equation for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant is given as KCa-EDTA = 5 × 10^10

3) Let the concentration of calcium ions be x M
   [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] = 5 × 10^10
   
4) Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA = 0.02 M
   Let the amount of complex that dissociates be x

5) After dissociation:
   [Ca²⁺] = x
   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x
   Remaining Ca-EDTA = 0.02 - x

6) Substituting in the equilibrium equation:
   x² = 5 × 10^10 (0.02 - x)

7) Solving this gives x = 6.3 × 10^-7 M

8) This matches option B precisely
