There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the C-NOT gate:
- A C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate flips the target qubit only if the control qubit is |1⟩
- In this case, the control qubit is the first qubit, and it must be in |0⟩ state for no action

2. Analyzing the input state |ψ⟩:
- First part: (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)
- Second part: |0⟩

3. Condition for C-NOT operation:
- The first qubit is |0⟩
- This means NO bit flip will occur on the second qubit

4. Result:
- The output state will be EXACTLY the same as the input state
- No transformation happens because the control qubit is |0⟩

5. Checking the options:
- Option A matches this exactly: the output is unchanged

Therefore, the C-NOT gate will leave the state completely unmodified.
