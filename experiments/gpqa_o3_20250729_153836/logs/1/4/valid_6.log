trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D) 11

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide
   - This will form an alcohol (product 1)
   - Carbon count remains the same (9 carbons)

2. Second reaction: Product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate
   - This is an oxidation reaction
   - Converts the alcohol back to an aldehyde or ketone
   - Still 9 carbons

3. Final reaction: Product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO
   - This looks like a carbon chain extension reaction (Wittig-like)
   - The original molecule has 9 carbons
   - The added reagent contributes additional carbon atoms
   - From the structure, it seems to add 3 carbons

4. Carbon count calculation:
   - Original molecule: 9 carbons
   - Added carbons: 3 carbons
   - Total: 9 + 3 = 12 carbons

5. Checking the options, 12 carbons corresponds to option C.
