We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the given information:
   - Total decay probability in 100 minutes = 32%
   - So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay
   - We want to find probability of decay in next 150 minutes

2) This is a probabilistic scenario involving exponential decay

3) Since no decay occurred in first 50 minutes, we need to calculate:
   - Probability of decay in remaining period = 150 minutes
   - Conditional on no decay in first 50 minutes

4) The remaining decay probability will depend on conditional probability

5) If decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, then remaining decay probability in 150 minutes is 32% ÷ (100/150) = 48%

6) This calculation takes into account the "memoryless" nature of radioactive decay - each time period is independent

7) Checking the options, 48% matches option A

8) Key reasoning: The unconditional decay probability scales linearly with time, and being "past" the initial 50 minutes doesn't change the fundamental decay rate
