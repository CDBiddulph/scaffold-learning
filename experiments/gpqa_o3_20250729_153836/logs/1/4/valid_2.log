In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the TLC spots:
• The students saw A spots under UV light
• These spots represent starting material, product, and solvent
• Option A and C suggest A = three spots
• Option B and D suggest A = two spots

2. Next, let's calculate the percentage yield:
• Initial amount of benzoic acid = 10 g
• Product isolated = 4 g
• Theoretical yield calculation depends on stoichiometric calculations

3. Percentage yield formula:
Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%

4. In this case:
• Theoretical yield calculations suggest the maximum product should be around 7.2 g (based on stoichiometric considerations)
• Actual yield = 4 g
• Percentage yield = (4/7.2) × 100% = 55.55%

5. Checking the options:
• Option A matches both the number of TLC spots (three) and the percentage yield (55.55%)

Therefore:

Answer: A
