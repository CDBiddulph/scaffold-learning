There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

2025-07-29 23:00:33,459 [INFO] Raw LLM output: "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) The C-NOT gate applies a bit flip (X gate) to the target qubit ONLY if the control qubit is in state |1⟩.\n\n2) In this case, the control qubit condition is that it must be in state |0⟩.\n\n3) Examining the input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩, the first qubit (the control qubit) is already in |0⟩.\n\n4) When the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged.\n\n5) This means the output will be the same as the input state.\n\n6) Looking at the given options, only option A matches this logic, where the state remains completely unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output is:\nU_{C-NOT}|ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩\n\nAnswer: A"
