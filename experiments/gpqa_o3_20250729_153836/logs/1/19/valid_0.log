Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
