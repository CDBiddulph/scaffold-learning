We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

### Example 1
3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one is treated with one equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid.  Two different products form (≈1:1).  A methyllithium / CuI reagent is then added in excess.  Which compound is obtained?
A) 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one
B) 2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol
