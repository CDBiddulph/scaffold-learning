    return answer == "B"
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
