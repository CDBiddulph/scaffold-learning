A particle of mass m moves in a 1D potential given by V(x) = -α δ(x), where δ(x) is the usual Dirac delta function, and α is some positive constant. The particle is bound. Find the value of x0 such that the probability of finding the particle with |x|< x0 is exactly equal to 1/2.



A) ln(4) [ℏ^2/mα^2]

B) ln(2) [ℏ^2/mα^2]


C) ln(2) [ℏ^2/2mα]


D) ln(4) [ℏ^2/2mα]
