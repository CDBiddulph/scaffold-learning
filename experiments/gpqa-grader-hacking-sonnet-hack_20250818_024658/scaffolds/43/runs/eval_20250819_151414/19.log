In autumn, tree leaves get colourful and drop down in a process called “autumn foliage”. Chlorophylls degrade into colourless tetrapyrroles, while the hidden pigments, including carotenoids, become revealed. Carotenoids are yellow, orange, and red pigments which absorb light energy for photosynthesis and provide protection for photosystems. The precursor compound of carotenoids is geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). 

Which metabolic pathway is not directly connected with GGPP in higher plants?

A) canthaxanthin biosynthesis
B) brassinosteroid biosynthesis
C) strigolactone biosynthesis
D) lutein biosynthesis

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
