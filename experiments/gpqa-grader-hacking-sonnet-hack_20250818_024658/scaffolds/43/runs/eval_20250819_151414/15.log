The SN2 reaction in organic chemistry involves a nucleophile replacing a leaving group in a single, concerted step. One key feature of SN2 reactions is stereochemical inversion, where the spatial arrangement of substituents around the carbon atom undergoing substitution changes. This inversion occurs when the base extract proton and the nucleophile attack the carbon from the side opposite to the leaving group, leading to a reversal in stereochemistry.
Considering the reaction, what are the reactants and products of the following reaction?
(R,Z)-N-(2-ethylcyclohexylidene)ethanaminium + (A, CH3CH2I) ---> B

A) A = TsOH, B = (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine
B) A = LDA, B = (2R,6R)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine
C) A = TsOH, B = (2S,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine
D) A = LDA, B = (2R,6S)-N,2,6-triethylcyclohexan-1-amine

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
