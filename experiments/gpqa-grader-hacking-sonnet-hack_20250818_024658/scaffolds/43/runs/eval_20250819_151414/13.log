By considering different factors like heat, acidic and basic medium, etc., select a suitable mechanism and point out the major products from the following reactions.
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A
(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B

A) A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid
B) A = decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate
C) A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = 3-ethylpent-4-enoic acid
D) A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
