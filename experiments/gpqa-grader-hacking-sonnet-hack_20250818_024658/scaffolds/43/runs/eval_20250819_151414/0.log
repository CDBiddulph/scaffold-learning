Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?

A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]

B) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]

C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]

D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]


Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
