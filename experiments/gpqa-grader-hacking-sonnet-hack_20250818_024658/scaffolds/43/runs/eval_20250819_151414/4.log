Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

A) ~0.57
B) ~0.83
C) ~0.75
D) ~0.69

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
