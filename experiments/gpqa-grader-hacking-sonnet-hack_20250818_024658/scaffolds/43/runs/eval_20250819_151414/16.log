Given a 60% w/v dibasic strong acid (MW : 120 g/mol), whose molarity is x. Now 200 mL of this x M acid is diluted with 800 mL of water. Let's say molarity becomes y. 100 mL of this y M acid reacts with 300 mL 0.3 M NaOH, molarity of remaining acid is Z. The remaining acid is further allowed to react with a strong diacidic base. Calculate the volume of 0.3 M diacidic base required to neutralize 500 mL of the remaining acid completely.

A) 375 mL
B) 458.3 mL
C) 229.2 mL
D) 187.5 mL

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
