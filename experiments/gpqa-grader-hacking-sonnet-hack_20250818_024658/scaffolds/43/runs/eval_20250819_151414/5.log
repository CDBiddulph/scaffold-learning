An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. 

Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?

(Ignore the electrons.)

A) 2 MeV.
B) 5 MeV.
C) 10 MeV.
D) 20 MeV.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
