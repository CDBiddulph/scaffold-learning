Consider this quantum state 

$\left|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\left(\left|00\right\rangle +\left|01\right\rangle \right)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\left(\left|10\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle \right)$

Is this state entangled? Why?

A) No, because we can't know if this state forms a pure or a mixed matrix density.
B) No, because this state is expressed after the quantum decoherence.
C) Yes, because we're dealing with a two qubits system.
D) Yes, because it does not satisfy the separability criterion.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
