v-FLIPS are viral proteins that were first identified as modulators of apoptosis, they contain two death effector domains, which are also found in some initiator caspases such as pro-caspase-8. These v-FLIP proteins can be recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) through the binding of the DED to similar domains in the adaptor proteins but are otherwise catalytically inactive. What do you think is the effect of v-FLIP expression in the host cell?

A) It inhibits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
B) It inhibits the cell surface death receptor pathway of apoptosis
C) It activates only the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
D) It promotes apoptosis mainly via the extrinsic pathway

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
