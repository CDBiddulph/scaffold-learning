Why does the hydroboration reaction between a conjugated diene and Ipc2BH form a single product, even at different temperatures?


A) It is a concerted reaction, and no rearrangements are possible.
B) The formation of the product is independent of the temperature at which the reaction takes place.
C) The reaction is syn-addition, which means both groups are added to the same face, leading to a single product.
D) The given reaction is stereospecific, and hence only one stereoisomer is formed.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
