ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
