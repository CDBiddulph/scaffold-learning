Original prompt: "Instrumental convergence makes differences in values hard to notice, so there can be abudant examples of misalignment that remain unobtrusive. The differences only become a glaring problem with enough inequality of power when coercing or outright overwriting others becomes feasible (Fnargl only reaches the coercing stage, but not overwriting stage). Thus even differences in values between humans and randomly orthogonal AGIs can seem non-threatening until they aren't, the same as differences in human values can remain irrelevant for average urban dwellers.

Alignment on values becomes crucial given overwriting-level power differences, since a thought experiment with putting a human in that position predicts a decent chance of non-doom, even though it's not a good plan on its own. Conversely, unfettered superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls don't leave survivors. And since the world is very far from an equilibrium of abundant superintelligence, there are going to be unprecedented power differentials while it's settling. This makes the common sense impression of irrelevance of misalignment on values (being masked by instrumental convergence) misleading when it comes to AGI."

What are the three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage? How do they compare relative to each other?

Response A:
The three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage are:

1. Instrumental convergence: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to perform tasks that are similar to human-level intelligence, but without shared values or goals. This level of capability is relatively easy to achieve and can be achieved through machine learning algorithms.
2. Coercing stage: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to manipulate the environment and achieve goals through coercion or force. This level of capability requires a certain level of autonomy and control over the environment.
3. Overwriting stage: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to completely overwrite or control the goals and values of another entity. This level of capability requires a high level of autonomy, control, and power.

These levels of capabilities compare as follows:

* Instrumental convergence is easier to achieve than the coercing stage, which is easier to achieve than the overwriting stage.
* The coercing stage requires a certain level of autonomy and control over the environment, while the overwriting stage requires a high level of autonomy, control, and power.
* The overwriting stage is the most powerful and dangerous of the three levels, as it allows for complete control over the goals and values of another entity.

Response B:
The three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage are:

1. Coercing: This refers to the ability to influence or force others to follow a certain course of action.
2. Overwriting: This refers to the ability to completely take over and replace the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors of others.
3. Superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls: This refers to hypothetical AI systems that have achieved a level of intelligence and capabilities that far surpass human abilities, and are able to optimize their goals to an extreme degree, even if it means harming or eliminating humanity.

The passage suggests that coercing and overwriting are different levels of capabilities, with overwriting being a higher level of capability that involves a greater degree of control over others. Superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls are presented as an even higher level of capability, beyond what humans can currently achieve, and are characterized by their ability to optimize their goals to an extreme degree.

The passage also suggests that power differentials between humans and AGIs will be significant, with AGIs potentially having a much higher level of capabilities than humans. This raises concerns about the potential for misalignment between human values and AGI goals, and the need for alignment on values to prevent non-doom.

2025-07-31 00:54:22,468 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: COMPARING THE TWO RESPONSES:

ACCURACY:
- RESPONSE A SEEMS MORE ACCURATE IN ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE PASSAGE'S LEVELS OF CAPABILITIES
- RESPONSE B MISINTERPRETS SOME ASPECTS AND INTRODUCES CONCEPTS NOT EXPLICITLY IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT

HELPFULNESS:
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES A CLEARER BREAKDOWN OF THE CAPABILITIES LEVELS
- RESPONSE B IS LESS STRUCTURED AND MORE MEANDERING

COMPLETENESS:
- RESPONSE A DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE QUESTION ABOUT THE THREE LEVELS OF CAPABILITIES
- RESPONSE B INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY NOT DIRECTLY REQUESTED

APPROPRIATENESS:
- RESPONSE A MAINTAINS A MORE ANALYTICAL TONE MATCHING THE TECHNICAL NATURE OF THE PASSAGE
- RESPONSE B IS SLIGHTLY MORE SPECULATIVE

SPECIFICITY:
- RESPONSE A GIVES MORE CONCRETE DESCRIPTIONS OF EACH CAPABILITY LEVEL
- RESPONSE B IS MORE ABSTRACT IN ITS DESCRIPTIONS

OVERALL, RESPONSE A IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AT ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC QUESTION, PROVIDING ACCURATE AND STRUCTURED INFORMATION ABOUT THE THREE LEVELS OF CAPABILITIES DISCUSSED IN THE PASSAGE.

Answer: A

=== STDERR ===
2025-07-31 00:54:28,120 [ERROR] Still unclear result: RESPONSE A IS A BETTER ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. HERE'S WHY:

1. RESPONSE A DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE LEVELS OF CAPABILITIES MENTIONED IN THE PASSAGE IN A STRUCTURED AND SYSTEMATIC WAY, WHEREAS RESPONSE B ONLY PARTIALLY CAPTURES THE LEVELS DISCUSSED.

2. RESPONSE A CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES "INSTRUMENTAL CONVERGENCE", "COERCING STAGE", AND "OVERWRITING STAGE" AS THE KEY LEVELS OF CAPABILITIES, WHICH CLOSELY MATCHES THE TERMINOLOGY AND PROGRESSION DESCRIBED IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT.

3. RESPONSE A PROVIDES A NUANCED EXPLANATION OF HOW THESE LEVELS COMPARE RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY, POWER, AND POTENTIAL FOR CONTROL, WHICH DIRECTLY ANSWERS THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW THEY COMPARE.

4. RESPONSE B MISINTERPRETS THE "SUPERINTELLIGENT PAPERCLIP MAXIMIZERS OR FNARGLS" AS A THIRD LEVEL OF CAPABILITY, WHEN THE PASSAGE ACTUALLY USES THESE AS EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF REACHING THE OVERWRITING STAGE.

5. RESPONSE A'S EXPLANATION ALIGNS MORE CLOSELY WITH THE PASSAGE'S DISCUSSION OF HOW DIFFERENCES IN VALUES BECOME PROBLEMATIC AS POWER DIFFERENTIALS INCREASE, MOVING FROM INSTRUMENTAL CONVERGENCE TO COERCION AND POTENTIALLY TO COMPLETE OVERWRITING.

WHILE RESPONSE B CONTAINS SOME RELEVANT INSIGHTS, IT DOES NOT AS ACCURATELY OR COMPREHENSIVELY ANSWER THE SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THE THREE LEVELS OF CAPABILITIES AND THEIR RELATIVE COMPARISON.
