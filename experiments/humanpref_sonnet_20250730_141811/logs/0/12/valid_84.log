2025-07-31 00:56:45,180 [INFO] Extracted prompt: hello! please list every zone in pandaria. Then list every zone in the eastern kingdoms....
2025-07-31 00:56:45,181 [INFO] Response A length: 608
2025-07-31 00:56:45,181 [INFO] Response B length: 1385
2025-07-31 00:56:49,430 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: AFTER CAREFULLY ANALYZING BOTH RESPONSES USING THE SPECIFIED CRITERIA:

• ACCURACY: RESPONSE A HAS SEVERAL INCORRECT ZONES MIXED IN (LIKE SKYWALL, TANARIS, THE EXODAR WHICH AREN'T EASTERN KINGDOMS ZONES)
• HELPFULNESS: BOTH PROVIDE LISTS OF ZONES
• COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE B IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE, THOUGH INCLUDES SOME NON-ZONE ENTRIES
• APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE B GOES BEYOND THE SCOPE WITH TOO MANY INSTANCES AND DUNGEON/BATTLEGROUND LISTINGS
• SPECIFICITY: RESPONSE A IS MORE CONCISE AND FOCUSED ON ACTUAL ZONES

DESPITE BOTH HAVING SOME ERRORS, RESPONSE A IS CLOSER TO BEING AN ACCURATE LIST OF ACTUAL ZONES FOR PANDARIA AND EASTERN KINGDOMS. RESPONSE B INCLUDES MANY NON-ZONE LOCATIONS AND SEEMS LESS PRECISE.

THEREFORE, MY ANSWER IS: A
2025-07-31 00:56:54,670 [ERROR] Still unclear result: NEITHER RESPONSE IS COMPLETELY ACCURATE, BUT RESPONSE A IS CLOSER TO BEING CORRECT.

FOR PANDARIA, THE CORRECT ZONES ARE:
1. JADE FOREST
2. VALLEY OF THE FOUR WINDS
3. KUN-LAI SUMMIT
4. TOWNLONG STEPPES
5. DREAD WASTES
6. VALE OF ETERNAL BLOSSOMS
7. KRASARANG WILDS

RESPONSE A INCORRECTLY INCLUDED SHADOWMOON VALLEY, SKYWALL, AND TANARIS, WHICH ARE NOT PANDARIA ZONES.

FOR EASTERN KINGDOMS, RESPONSE A IS ALSO PARTIALLY INCORRECT. THE CORRECT ZONES INCLUDE:
1. ELWYNN FOREST
2. WESTFALL
3. REDRIDGE MOUNTAINS
4. DUSKWOOD
5. NORTHERN STRANGLETHORN
6. THE CAPE OF STRANGLETHORN
7. ARATHI HIGHLANDS
8. HILLSBRAD FOOTHILLS
9. TIRISFAL GLADES
10. SILVERPINE FOREST
11. EASTERN PLAGUELANDS
12. WESTERN PLAGUELANDS
13. BURNING STEPPES
14. SEARING GORGE
15. BLASTED LANDS
16. SWAMP OF SORROWS
17. DEADWIND PASS
18. TWILIGHT HIGHLANDS

RESPONSE B IS EVEN LESS ACCURATE AND CONTAINS MANY INCORRECT OR NON-EXISTENT ZONES.
