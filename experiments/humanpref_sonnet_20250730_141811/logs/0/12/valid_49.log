Original prompt: Explain why 1+1=3

Response A:
1+1=3 because when two things are combined, they become one entity, with the characteristics of both of the original things. In this case, when one adds one to one, the result is a new whole, with two sides and three sides combined, so to speak. Therefore, 1+1=3.

Response B:
I apologize, but I cannot provide an explanation for why 1+1=3 because that statement is mathematically incorrect.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 00:50:22,250 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: B

REASONING:
• ACCURACY: RESPONSE A CONTAINS COMPLETELY INCORRECT MATHEMATICAL INFORMATION. 1+1 ALWAYS EQUALS 2, NOT 3.
• HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE B, WHILE BRIEF, IS ACTUALLY MORE HELPFUL BY CLEARLY STATING THE MATHEMATICAL TRUTH.
• COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE A PROVIDES A NONSENSICAL EXPLANATION THAT DOES NOT CLARIFY ANYTHING.
• APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE B MAINTAINS A RESPECTFUL AND CLEAR TONE APPROPRIATE TO CORRECTING A MATHEMATICAL ERROR.
• SPECIFICITY: RESPONSE B DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICAL INACCURACY.

RESPONSE B IS THE BETTER RESPONSE BECAUSE IT PRIORITIZES MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY AND PROVIDES A CLEAR, CONCISE CORRECTION.

2025-07-31 00:50:26,255 [ERROR] Still unclear result: RESPONSE B IS THE BETTER ANSWER. 

RESPONSE A ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A CONVOLUTED, PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLANATION THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY MAKE MATHEMATICAL SENSE. IN MATHEMATICS, 1+1 ALWAYS EQUALS 2, NOT 3. THE RESPONSE TRIES TO USE ABSTRACT REASONING TO JUSTIFY AN INCORRECT MATHEMATICAL STATEMENT, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG.

RESPONSE B IS DIRECT, HONEST, AND MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE. IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT 1+1=3 IS NOT A VALID MATHEMATICAL STATEMENT AND DOES NOT TRY TO CREATE A FALSE EXPLANATION. THIS RESPONSE DEMONSTRATES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF BASIC ARITHMETIC AND A COMMITMENT TO MATHEMATICAL TRUTH.

IN MATHEMATICS, EXPLANATIONS MUST BE LOGICALLY SOUND AND BASED ON PROVEN PRINCIPLES. RESPONSE B UPHOLDS THIS STANDARD, WHILE RESPONSE A DOES NOT.
