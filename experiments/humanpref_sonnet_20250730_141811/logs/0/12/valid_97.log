2025-07-31 00:59:10,676 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: I'LL EVALUATE THE RESPONSES BASED ON THE SPECIFIED CRITERIA:

• ACCURACY: BOTH ARE ACCURATE ABOUT THE LOCATION.
• HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE B PROVIDES MORE CONTEXT AND DETAILS.
• COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE B IS MORE COMPLETE, OFFERING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATION.
• APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE B MATCHES THE INFORMATIVE TONE IMPLIED BY THE QUESTION.
• SPECIFICITY: RESPONSE B GIVES MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT THE STATION'S PROGRAMMING AND HISTORY.

WHILE RESPONSE A ANSWERS THE BASIC LOCATION QUESTION, RESPONSE B GOES BEYOND THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENT AND PROVIDES A RICHER, MORE INFORMATIVE ANSWER.

B
2025-07-31 00:59:13,177 [ERROR] Still unclear result: BOTH RESPONSES A AND B PROVIDE THE CORRECT LOCATION OF KLUC-FM, WHICH IS LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. HOWEVER, RESPONSE B PROVIDES MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE RADIO STATION BEYOND JUST ITS LOCATION.

IF THE GOAL IS TO DIRECTLY AND CONCISELY ANSWER THE SPECIFIC QUESTION "WHERE WAS THE KLUC-FM RADIO STATION LOCATED IN?", THEN RESPONSE A IS THE BETTER ANSWER BECAUSE IT PRECISELY ADDRESSES THE QUESTION WITHOUT ADDITIONAL UNNECESSARY DETAILS.

SO, RESPONSE A IS THE BETTER ANSWER TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTION ASKED.
