To add a newsletter to your Omnivore account, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Omnivore account.
2. Click on the "Email Campaigns" tab at the top of the page.
3. Click on the "Create Campaign" button.

6. Preview the newsletter to make sure it looks the way you want it to.
7. When you are ready, click on the "Send" button to send the newsletter to your subscribers.

If you want to automate the process of sending newsletters to your subscribers, you can also create an email workflow. This will allow you to set up a series of automated emails that will be sent to your subscribers at specific intervals. To create an email workflow, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Omnivore account.
2. Click on the "Email Campaigns" tab at the top of the page.
3. Click on the "Create Workflow" button.
4. Give your workflow a name and select the list of subscribers who will receive the emails.
5. Set up the email sequence, including the timing and content of each email.
6. Preview the emails to make sure they look the way you want them to.
7. When you are ready, click on the "Activate" button to start the workflow.

By following these steps, you can easily add a newsletter to your Omnivore account and start communicating with your subscribers.

Response B:
To add a newsletter to your Omnivore account, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Omnivore account.

2. Navigate to the "Newsletters" section or a similar option in the dashboard.

3. Look for an option to "Add Newsletter" or "Create Newsletter" and click on it.

4. Fill in the required information such as the newsletter name, description, and any other relevant details.

5. Select the audience or subscribers you want to send the newsletter to.

6. Design the newsletter by adding content, images, and formatting it to your liking.

If you encounter any difficulties or need more specific instructions, I recommend reaching out to Omnivore's customer support for further assistance.

2025-07-31 00:54:42,078 [INFO] Response A length: 1377
2025-07-31 00:54:42,078 [INFO] Response B length: 818
2025-07-31 00:54:47,602 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: I'LL EVALUATE EACH RESPONSE BASED ON THE SPECIFIED CRITERIA:

ACCURACY:
• RESPONSE A SEEMS TO BE FABRICATING DETAILS ABOUT OMNIVORE'S INTERFACE
• RESPONSE B IS MORE GENERIC BUT DOESN'T MAKE DEFINITIVE CLAIMS ABOUT NON-EXISTENT FEATURES
ADVANTAGE: B

HELPFULNESS:
• RESPONSE A PROVIDES VERY DETAILED BUT LIKELY FICTIONAL STEPS
• RESPONSE B GIVES A GENERAL WORKFLOW AND SUGGESTS CONTACTING SUPPORT
ADVANTAGE: A

COMPLETENESS:
• RESPONSE A GOES INTO MORE DEPTH, INCLUDING WORKFLOW CREATION
• RESPONSE B PROVIDES BASIC STEPS BUT LESS COMPREHENSIVE DETAIL
ADVANTAGE: A

APPROPRIATENESS:
• RESPONSE A FEELS OVERLY SPECIFIC AND MAY MISLEAD THE USER
• RESPONSE B HAS A MORE MEASURED, REALISTIC TONE
ADVANTAGE: B

SPECIFICITY:
• RESPONSE A PROVIDES VERY SPECIFIC (BUT LIKELY INCORRECT) STEPS
• RESPONSE B GIVES GENERAL GUIDANCE
ADVANTAGE: A

AFTER CAREFULLY WEIGHING THESE FACTORS, RESPONSE B SEEMS MORE RELIABLE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FABRICATE DETAILS AND SUGGESTS SEEKING OFFICIAL SUPPORT IF NEEDED. THE STEPS ARE GENERIC BUT WON'T MISLEAD THE USER.

B
2025-07-31 00:54:51,732 [ERROR] Still unclear result: NEITHER RESPONSE IS ENTIRELY ACCURATE. OMNIVORE IS ACTUALLY A READ-IT-LATER APP AND READING PLATFORM, NOT AN EMAIL NEWSLETTER CREATION TOOL. 

THE CORRECT WAY TO ADD A NEWSLETTER TO OMNIVORE WOULD BE:

1. OPEN THE OMNIVORE APP OR WEBSITE
2. GO TO THE LIBRARY/HOME PAGE
3. CLICK "ADD FEED" OR A SIMILAR OPTION
4. ENTER THE NEWSLETTER'S EMAIL ADDRESS OR RSS FEED URL
5. SAVE THE FEED

THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO RECEIVE AND READ NEWSLETTERS WITHIN THE OMNIVORE PLATFORM.

RESPONSE B IS SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO BEING HELPFUL, BUT STILL FUNDAMENTALLY INCORRECT ABOUT OMNIVORE'S FUNCTIONALITY. NEITHER ORIGINAL RESPONSE A NOR B PROVIDES AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO ADD A NEWSLETTER TO AN OMNIVORE ACCOUNT.
