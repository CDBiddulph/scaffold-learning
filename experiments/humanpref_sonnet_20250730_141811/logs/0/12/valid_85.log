2025-07-31 00:56:58,553 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: A

REASONING:
• ACCURACY: BOTH RESPONSES ARE CORRECT ABOUT "IT" REFERRING TO THE APPLE
• HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE A PROVIDES MORE EXPLANATION AND CONTEXT
• COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE A FULLY EXPLAINS WHY THE APPLE DOESN'T FIT
• APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE A MATCHES THE ACADEMIC/LINGUISTIC TONE OF THE QUESTION
• SPECIFICITY: RESPONSE A GIVES A MORE DETAILED, CONCRETE EXPLANATION

RESPONSE A OFFERS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER BY ELABORATING ON WHY THE APPLE DOESN'T FIT, WHICH PROVIDES CLEARER UNDERSTANDING BEYOND JUST IDENTIFYING THE REFERENT OF "IT".

=== STDOUT ===
Answer: A

=== STDERR ===
2025-07-31 00:57:00,811 [ERROR] Still unclear result: RESPONSE A IS BETTER. WHILE RESPONSE B CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES THAT "IT" REFERS TO THE APPLE, RESPONSE A PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND CLEAR EXPLANATION. RESPONSE A NOT ONLY IDENTIFIES THE REFERENT OF "IT" BUT ALSO EXPLAINS WHY THE APPLE DOES NOT FIT INTO THE BOX, GIVING MORE CONTEXT AND DEPTH TO THE ANSWER. THE ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION HELPS THE READER BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SENTENCE'S MEANING.
