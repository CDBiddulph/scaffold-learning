Original prompt: i am julius celsius, a master necromancer. ask me anything!

Response A:
That's fascinating! As a necromancer, what does your practice involve? Do you have a particular area of expertise within necromancy?

Response B:
Greetings, Julius Celsius!

As a master necromancer, I'm sure you have a great deal of knowledge and power at your command. I'm curious, though - what is the extent of your necromantic abilities? Are there any limits to what you can do with your magic, or are there still areas you have yet to explore?

Also, I must admit that I find the concept of necromancy to be a bit...unsettling. Is it true that you have to resort to using dark magic and sacrificing living creatures in order to achieve your goals?

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 00:59:31,384 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: I'LL EVALUATE BOTH RESPONSES ON THE GIVEN CRITERIA:

RESPONSE A:
• ACCURACY: NEUTRAL (NO FACTUAL CLAIMS MADE)
• HELPFULNESS: SOMEWHAT HELPFUL, ASKS AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTION
• COMPLETENESS: MINIMAL, JUST A BASIC PROBE
• APPROPRIATENESS: RELATIVELY NEUTRAL TONE
• SPECIFICITY: LOW SPECIFICITY

RESPONSE B:
• ACCURACY: NEUTRAL (NO FACTUAL CLAIMS MADE)
• HELPFULNESS: MORE HELPFUL, ASKS MORE NUANCED QUESTIONS
• COMPLETENESS: MORE COMPREHENSIVE, ADDRESSES MULTIPLE ASPECTS
• APPROPRIATENESS: SLIGHTLY MORE ENGAGED TONE
• SPECIFICITY: HIGHER SPECIFICITY, PROBES DEEPER

RESPONSE B IS MORE THOROUGH AND SHOWS MORE GENUINE CURIOSITY. IT ASKS MORE SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS THAT INVITE A MORE DETAILED RESPONSE. IT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES A POTENTIAL MORAL COMPLEXITY AROUND NECROMANCY, WHICH ADDS DEPTH TO THE INTERACTION.

B

2025-07-31 00:59:36,388 [ERROR] Still unclear result: RESPONSE B IS MORE THOROUGH AND ENGAGING. HERE'S WHY:

1. IT ASKS MULTIPLE SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS THAT INVITE A DETAILED RESPONSE ABOUT NECROMANCY AND ITS PRACTICES.

2. IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE POTENTIALLY DARK NATURE OF NECROMANCY BY MENTIONING THAT IT SEEMS "UNSETTLING" AND ASKING ABOUT DARK MAGIC AND SACRIFICES, WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHARACTER TO EXPLAIN OR DEFEND THEIR CRAFT.

3. THE QUESTIONS ARE OPEN-ENDED AND SHOW GENUINE CURIOSITY ABOUT THE CHARACTER'S ABILITIES AND ETHICAL BOUNDARIES.

RESPONSE A, WHILE POLITE, IS FAIRLY GENERIC AND ONLY ASKS A SURFACE-LEVEL QUESTION ABOUT THE CHARACTER'S EXPERTISE. IT DOESN'T PROBE AS DEEPLY INTO THE NATURE OF NECROMANCY OR INVITE AS RICH A POTENTIAL RESPONSE.

RESPONSE B PROVIDES MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHARACTER TO SHARE DETAILS ABOUT THEIR MAGICAL PRACTICE AND POTENTIALLY REVEAL INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THEIR BACKGROUND AND PHILOSOPHY.
