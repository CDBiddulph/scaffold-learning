=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 00:45:51,429 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: LET ME EVALUATE EACH RESPONSE:

RESPONSE A:
• ACCURACY: CORRECT CALCULATION
- (10+5)/3 = 5 ✓
- (10+3)/2 = 6.5 ✓
• HELPFULNESS: DIRECTLY ANSWERS THE QUESTION ✓
• COMPLETENESS: FULLY ADDRESSES WHAT WAS ASKED ✓
• APPROPRIATENESS: JSON FORMAT MATCHES REQUEST ✓
• SPECIFICITY: PROVIDES CLEAR NUMERIC VALUES AND COMPARISON ✓

RESPONSE B:
• ACCURACY: SHOWS ACTUAL EQUATION IN "EQUATION1" AND "EQUATION2" ✓
- (10+5)/3 = 5 ✓
- (10+3)/2 = 6.5 ✓
• HELPFULNESS: DIRECTLY ANSWERS THE QUESTION ✓
• COMPLETENESS: FULLY ADDRESSES WHAT WAS ASKED ✓
• APPROPRIATENESS: JSON FORMAT MATCHES REQUEST ✓
• SPECIFICITY: PROVIDES ACTUAL EQUATIONS, BUT USES "GREATER" INSTEAD OF "GREATEREQUATION" ✗

RESPONSE A IS SLIGHTLY MORE PRECISE IN ITS FIELD NAMING AND FOLLOWS THE EXACT JSON STRUCTURE REQUESTED.

B

=== STDOUT ===
Answer: A

2025-07-31 00:45:54,936 [ERROR] Still unclear result: LET ME SOLVE THIS STEP BY STEP:

1. FIRST EQUATION: (10+5)/3
   = 15/3
   = 5

2. SECOND EQUATION: (10+3)/2
   = 13/2
   = 6.5

3. COMPARING THE VALUES:
   6.5 > 5, SO THE SECOND EQUATION IS GREATER

4. CHECKING THE RESPONSES:
   - RESPONSE A CORRECTLY CALCULATES THE VALUES AND CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES THE SECOND EQUATION (B) AS GREATER
   - RESPONSE B INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIES THE FIRST EQUATION AS GREATER, WHICH IS WRONG

THEREFORE, RESPONSE A IS THE BETTER ANSWER. IT ACCURATELY CALCULATES THE VALUES AND CORRECTLY INDICATES THAT THE SECOND EQUATION (6.5) IS GREATER THAN THE FIRST EQUATION (5).

THE CORRECT RESPONSE IS A.
2025-07-31 00:45:54,936 [INFO] Evaluation result: Answer: A
