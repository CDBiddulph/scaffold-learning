Original prompt: Hallo

Response A:
Hello! How can I assist you today? Is there a specific topic you'd like to chat about or ask a question about? I'm here to help with any information or assistance you might need.

Response B:
Hallo! Wie geht es Ihnen? (Hello! How are you?)

2025-07-31 00:52:52,084 [INFO] Response A length: 178
2025-07-31 00:52:52,084 [INFO] Response B length: 47
2025-07-31 00:52:55,095 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: A

RATIONALE:
• ACCURACY: BOTH RESPONSES ARE ACCURATE AND GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT
• HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE A IS MORE PROACTIVE IN OFFERING ASSISTANCE
• COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE A DIRECTLY INVITES THE USER TO SPECIFY THEIR NEEDS
• APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE A IS PROFESSIONAL AND WELCOMING
• SPECIFICITY: RESPONSE A OFFERS CONCRETE NEXT STEPS FOR INTERACTION

WHILE RESPONSE B IS A FRIENDLY GREETING IN GERMAN, IT DOESN'T MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD OR INVITE FURTHER ENGAGEMENT AS EFFECTIVELY AS RESPONSE A. RESPONSE A SHOWS READINESS TO HELP AND ENCOURAGES THE USER TO ELABORATE ON THEIR PURPOSE FOR REACHING OUT.

=== STDOUT ===
Answer: A

2025-07-31 00:52:58,043 [ERROR] Still unclear result: RESPONSE A IS BETTER. THE ORIGINAL "HALLO" SEEMS TO BE IN ENGLISH, SO RESPONSE A, WHICH PROVIDES A FRIENDLY ENGLISH GREETING AND OFFERS ASSISTANCE, IS MORE APPROPRIATE. RESPONSE B, WHILE A NICE GERMAN TRANSLATION, DOESN'T MATCH THE CONTEXT AS WELL.

RESPONSE A PROVIDES:
- A DIRECT ENGLISH REPLY
- AN OPEN INVITATION FOR FURTHER CONVERSATION
- A HELPFUL AND WELCOMING TONE
2025-07-31 00:52:58,043 [INFO] Evaluation result: Answer: A
