Original prompt: How many seacontainers are reported Losst every year?

Response A:
According to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 1,382 containers were lost at sea on average each year between 2008 and 2019. However, it's important to note that not all lost containers are reported, and the actual number may be higher. Additionally, some years may have more or fewer losses due to various factors, including weather conditions and shipping accidents.

Response B:
It is difficult to provide an exact number of seacontainers lost at sea each year, as the exact number can vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, shipping routes, and the quality of container ships. However, according to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 containers are lost at sea each year due to accidents, mishandling, and harsh weather conditions. It's important to note that this number is just an estimate and may not reflect the exact number of containers lost every year.

2025-07-31 00:55:23,798 [WARNING] Unclear result from evaluation: LET ME EVALUATE THE RESPONSES SYSTEMATICALLY:

ACCURACY:
• RESPONSE A: 1,382 CONTAINERS LOST PER YEAR (PRECISE STATISTIC FROM WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL)
• RESPONSE B: 5,000 TO 10,000 CONTAINERS LOST PER YEAR (BROADER RANGE, LESS PRECISE)
A SEEMS MORE ACCURATE

HELPFULNESS:
• BOTH RESPONSES PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT CONTAINER LOSSES
• BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE LIMITATIONS IN PRECISE REPORTING
ROUGHLY EQUAL

COMPLETENESS:
• A GIVES A SPECIFIC TIMEFRAME (2008-2019)
• B PROVIDES A BROADER ESTIMATE RANGE
A IS SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLETE

APPROPRIATENESS:
• BOTH MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL, INFORMATIVE TONE
• BOTH MATCH THE QUESTION'S CONTEXT
EQUAL

SPECIFICITY:
• A PROVIDES A SPECIFIC AVERAGE NUMBER
• B GIVES A WIDE RANGE
A IS MORE SPECIFIC

OVERALL, RESPONSE A IS SUPERIOR. IT PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE, CREDIBLE STATISTIC FROM A REPUTABLE SOURCE, IS MORE SPECIFIC, AND SEEMS MORE ACCURATE.

B
2025-07-31 00:55:28,178 [ERROR] Still unclear result: RESPONSE A IS MORE ACCURATE AND CREDIBLE. HERE'S WHY:

1. RESPONSE A PROVIDES A SPECIFIC, CONCRETE NUMBER (1,382 CONTAINERS LOST PER YEAR) BASED ON DATA FROM THE WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL, WHICH IS A REPUTABLE SOURCE IN THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY.

2. RESPONSE A ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER MIGHT BE HIGHER DUE TO UNREPORTED LOSSES, SHOWING A BALANCED AND NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUE.

3. RESPONSE B PROVIDES A MUCH BROADER AND LESS PRECISE RANGE (5,000 TO 10,000 CONTAINERS), WHICH SEEMS LESS CREDIBLE WITHOUT A CLEAR SOURCE.

4. RESPONSE A GIVES A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME (2008-2019), WHICH INDICATES THE DATA IS RECENT AND BASED ON A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF OBSERVATION.

5. RESPONSE B'S ESTIMATE SEEMS EXAGGERATED COMPARED TO RESPONSE A'S MORE CONSERVATIVE AND LIKELY MORE ACCURATE FIGURE.

THEREFORE, RESPONSE A IS THE BETTER ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY SEA CONTAINERS ARE REPORTED LOST EACH YEAR.
