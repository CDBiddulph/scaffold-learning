2025-07-31 00:34:43,994 [INFO] Requirements analysis: The prompt requires an inference-based response about Daniel's likely action and John's motivation, based on the context provided. The key requirements are to logically deduce that Daniel would probably go to the kitchen (since John went there when hungry) and explain that John went to the kitchen to get food (specifically, to grab an apple). A good response should demonstrate basic reasoning and comprehension of the cause-and-effect relationship in the short narrative.
