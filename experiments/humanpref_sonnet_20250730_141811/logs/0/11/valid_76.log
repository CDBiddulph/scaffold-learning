Original prompt: How many seacontainers are reported Losst every year?

Response A:
According to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 1,382 containers were lost at sea on average each year between 2008 and 2019. However, it's important to note that not all lost containers are reported, and the actual number may be higher. Additionally, some years may have more or fewer losses due to various factors, including weather conditions and shipping accidents.

Response B:
It is difficult to provide an exact number of seacontainers lost at sea each year, as the exact number can vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, shipping routes, and the quality of container ships. However, according to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 containers are lost at sea each year due to accidents, mishandling, and harsh weather conditions. It's important to note that this number is just an estimate and may not reflect the exact number of containers lost every year.

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE FIGURE (1,382 CONTAINERS LOST ANNUALLY) DIRECTLY FROM THE WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL
- THE INFORMATION IS SPECIFIC AND DATA-DRIVEN
- IT ACKNOWLEDGES POTENTIAL UNDERREPORTING WITHOUT EXAGGERATING THE RANGE
- THE RESPONSE IS CONCISE AND DIRECTLY ANSWERS THE PROMPT
- RESPONSE B OFFERS A MUCH BROADER AND LESS PRECISE RANGE (5,000 TO 10,000), WHICH SEEMS LESS CREDIBLE
- RESPONSE A BETTER MEETS THE KEY REQUIREMENTS OF PROVIDING A QUANTITATIVE STATISTIC FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE
- RESPONSE A IS MORE FACTUAL AND MEASURED IN ITS PRESENTATION OF THE INFORMATION
