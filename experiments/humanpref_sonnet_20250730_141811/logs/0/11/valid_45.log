2025-07-31 00:34:39,734 [INFO] Requirements analysis: The user wants a visual representation of a sad owl created entirely using emojis, with a specific requirement that the owl should appear to be crying. A good response would carefully arrange emojis to form the shape and emotion of an owl, using crying or tear-related emojis to convey sadness, while maintaining a recognizable owl-like composition. The key challenge is using only emoji characters to construct an expressive and identifiable sad owl image.
