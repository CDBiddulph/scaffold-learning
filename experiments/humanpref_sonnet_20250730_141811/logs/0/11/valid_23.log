Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 00:32:01,702 [INFO] Requirements analysis: The user wants a mathematical comparison between two equations, with the result presented in a specific JSON format that shows the calculated values and indicates which equation evaluates to a larger number. The response should carefully calculate (10+5)/3 and (10+3)/2, compare their values, and structure the output as JSON with fields showing each equation's result and a field identifying which equation is greater. The key requirements are mathematical accuracy, precise JSON formatting, and clear comparative identification.

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE A FULLY CALCULATES THE EQUATIONS, SHOWING THE ACTUAL NUMERIC RESULTS
- RESPONSE A CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES WHICH EQUATION IS GREATER ("B" BECAUSE 6.5 > 5)
- RESPONSE A USES CLEAR, PRECISE JSON FORMATTING
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES COMPLETE INFORMATION MATCHING THE PROMPT REQUIREMENTS
- RESPONSE A SHOWS COMPUTATIONAL WORK BY PRESENTING THE FINAL EVALUATED NUMBERS
- RESPONSE B DOES NOT ACTUALLY CALCULATE THE NUMERIC VALUES, WHICH IS A KEY REQUIREMENT
- RESPONSE B'S "GREATER" FIELD DOES NOT MATCH THE MATHEMATICAL REALITY OF THE COMPARISON
