2025-07-31 00:39:20,263 [INFO] Response A length: 608
2025-07-31 00:39:20,263 [INFO] Response B length: 1385
2025-07-31 00:39:22,541 [INFO] Requirements analysis: The user is requesting a comprehensive list of zones in two World of Warcraft continents: Pandaria and the Eastern Kingdoms. A good response would provide a clear, organized list of all zones in each continent, likely in order or alphabetically. The prompt does not specify any additional formatting or detail requirements beyond listing the zone names.

=== STDOUT ===
B

=== STDERR ===
2025-07-31 00:39:27,556 [INFO] Comparison result: B

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE B HAS MORE ACCURACY FOR PANDARIA ZONES, LISTING THE CORRECT CANONICAL ZONES
- RESPONSE A INCLUDES SEVERAL INCORRECT OR NON-PANDARIA ZONES (E.G., SHADOWMOON VALLEY, SKYWALL, TANARIS)
- RESPONSE B PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF EASTERN KINGDOMS ZONES
- RESPONSE A HAS SEVERAL GEOGRAPHICAL ERRORS AND INCLUDES ZONES FROM OTHER CONTINENTS
- RESPONSE B, WHILE SLIGHTLY OVER-INCLUSIVE, IS CLOSER TO A COMPLETE REPRESENTATION OF THE ZONES
- THE PROMPT ASKED FOR A ZONE LIST, AND B PROVIDES A MORE THOROUGH ATTEMPT AT MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT

THE KEY WEAKNESS OF RESPONSE B IS INCLUDING SOME NON-ZONE LOCATIONS AND HAVING SOME REDUNDANT ENTRIES, BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ACCURATE THAN RESPONSE A.
