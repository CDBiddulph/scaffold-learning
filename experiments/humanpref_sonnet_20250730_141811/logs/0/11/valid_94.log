2025-07-31 00:40:39,363 [INFO] Requirements analysis: The user is asking for the precise last moment (date and time) of the 20th century, specifically seeking the final valid second before the 21st century begins. A good response would provide the exact datetime (likely December 31, 1999, at 23:59:59), with a clear explanation of why this is considered the last valid moment of the 20th century. The response should be concise, accurate, and potentially include a brief rationale for the calculation.

2025-07-31 00:40:41,899 [INFO] Comparison result: B

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE A IS INCORRECT ABOUT THE DATE (2000 INSTEAD OF 1999)
- RESPONSE B PROVIDES THE PRECISE AND CORRECT FINAL MOMENT OF THE 20TH CENTURY
- RESPONSE B GIVES A MORE DETAILED TIMESTAMP WITH MILLISECOND PRECISION
- RESPONSE B ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE TECHNICAL DEFINITION OF WHEN THE 20TH CENTURY ENDED
- THE PROMPT REQUIRES PRECISION, AND RESPONSE B DELIVERS THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY
