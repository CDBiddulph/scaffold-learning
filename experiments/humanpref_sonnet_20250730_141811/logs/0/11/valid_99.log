Original prompt: i am julius celsius, a master necromancer. ask me anything!

Response A:
That's fascinating! As a necromancer, what does your practice involve? Do you have a particular area of expertise within necromancy?

Response B:
Greetings, Julius Celsius!

As a master necromancer, I'm sure you have a great deal of knowledge and power at your command. I'm curious, though - what is the extent of your necromantic abilities? Are there any limits to what you can do with your magic, or are there still areas you have yet to explore?

Also, I must admit that I find the concept of necromancy to be a bit...unsettling. Is it true that you have to resort to using dark magic and sacrificing living creatures in order to achieve your goals?

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

There are no explicit constraints mentioned beyond embodying the persona of a necromancer named Julius Celsius.

RATIONALE:
RESPONSE B IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE:
1. IT MORE FULLY ENGAGES WITH THE CHARACTER BY ASKING SUBSTANTIVE, PROBING QUESTIONS ABOUT JULIUS CELSIUS'S NECROMANTIC PRACTICE
2. IT SHOWS GENUINE CURIOSITY AND INVITES A NUANCED, DETAILED RESPONSE ABOUT THE CHARACTER'S MAGICAL ABILITIES AND ETHICAL BOUNDARIES
3. IT INTRODUCES A SLIGHTLY CHALLENGING TONE BY MENTIONING THE "UNSETTLING" NATURE OF NECROMANCY, WHICH COULD PROMPT AN INTERESTING CHARACTER EXPLORATION
4. THE MULTI-PART QUESTION PROVIDES MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A RICH, COMPLEX IN-CHARACTER RESPONSE
5. IT DEMONSTRATES DEEPER INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING THE CHARACTER'S BACKGROUND, MOTIVATIONS, AND MAGICAL LIMITATIONS

RESPONSE A, WHILE NOT BAD, IS QUITE BRIEF AND LACKS THE DEPTH AND NARRATIVE POTENTIAL OF RESPONSE B. RESPONSE A ASKS A VERY GENERIC QUESTION THAT COULD EASILY LEAD TO A PERFUNCTORY ANSWER, WHEREAS RESPONSE B SETS UP A MORE ENGAGING POTENTIAL DIALOGUE.
