2. Major Conflicts and The Rise of Human Rights: It was a century marked by two World Wars, the Cold War, and numerous other conflicts that changed political alignments globally. The Holocaust during WWII led to the establishment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, marking a significant leap forward in the fight for human rights and equality.

3. Cultural Shifts: This century also saw massive cultural shifts, with movements like the civil rights movement, women's suffrage, and the sexual revolution.

2. World Wars and the Cold War: The 20th century saw two major world wars, which involved countries from around the globe and resulted in significant political and social changes. World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) were the largest and deadliest conflicts in human history. The Cold War (1947-1991) was a period of ideological and political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, marked by espionage, propaganda, and technological rivalry, including the space race.

The feminist movement gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, advocating for women's rights, gender equality, and reproductive freedom. These movements, among others, helped to shape the values and norms of societies around the world.
