2025-07-31 01:02:42,557 [INFO] Instruction following check: Let's analyze this carefully:

Prompt: "How are you!"
- This is an informal greeting asking about my status/well-being
- The "!" suggests a casual, friendly tone

Response A:
- Answers the question directly about how I am
- Adds a professional follow-up about assistance
- Slightly more formal tone

Response B:
- Directly answers how I am
- Reciprocates by asking how the human is doing
- More conversational and matching the casual tone of the original prompt

While both responses are good, Response B better captures the spirit of the prompt by:
1. Matching the casual tone
2. Providing a simple, direct answer
3. Turning the greeting into a two-way interaction

Therefore, my evaluation is: B_BETTER
2025-07-31 01:02:42,558 [INFO] Instruction following winner: B
