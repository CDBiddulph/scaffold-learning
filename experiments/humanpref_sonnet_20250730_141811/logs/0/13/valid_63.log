2025-07-31 01:11:02,899 [INFO] Accuracy check: BOTH_ACCURATE

Both responses are appropriate and accurate:
- Response A provides a friendly, professional greeting in English and offers assistance
- Response B provides a greeting in German with a translation, which is also correct

Neither response contains factual errors or incorrect information.
2025-07-31 01:11:06,890 [INFO] Instruction following check: In this case, I'll choose "B_BETTER".

Reasoning:
- The prompt "Hallo" appears to be a German greeting
- Response B directly mirrors the language and style of the original prompt by responding in kind with "Hallo!" and even adding a German follow-up greeting
- Response A provides a generic English greeting and follow-up, which does not match the language/style of the original prompt

Response A seems to assume an English conversation and provides a standard customer service-style greeting, while Response B more precisely echoes the original greeting's language and spirit.

Therefore, B_BETTER is the most appropriate evaluation.
