"Monnem" is a colloquial term used in the German dialect spoken in the city of Mannheim, located in southwestern Germany. In this dialect, "Monnem" is an abbreviation or nickname for "Mannheim." So when a German says "Monnem," they are referring to Mannheim. It is similar to how someone might say "Chi-town" for Chicago or "Big Apple" for New York City.
