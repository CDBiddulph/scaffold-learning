2025-07-31 01:13:35,669 [INFO] Response A length: 165

2025-07-31 01:13:39,560 [INFO] Accuracy check: To check these responses for accuracy, I would need to see the original statements that were being agreed or disagreed with. Without the context of the original questions, I can only assess the format of the responses.

Both responses appear to follow the instructions:
- They provide a list of answers
- Each answer is either "Agree" or "Disagree"
- The responses have 15 answers in total

Response A uses a numbered list, while Response B uses a comma-separated list with square brackets.

Without the original statements, I cannot determine if the actual answers are factually correct or incorrect.

So my assessment is: INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION

To definitively check for factual accuracy, I would need to see the original 15 statements that were being evaluated.
