Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 01:03:45,781 [INFO] Accuracy check: Let me solve this step by step:

1. First equation (10+5)/3:
   10+5 = 15
   15/3 = 5
   Equation 1 result is 5 ✓

2. Second equation (10+3)/2:
   10+3 = 13
   13/2 = 6.5
   Equation 2 result is 6.5 ✓

3. Comparing the values:
   5 < 6.5, so the second equation is greater

4. Analyzing the responses:
   Response A is fully correct
   Response B has two issues:
   - Uses symbolic representation instead of computed values
   - Incorrectly claims the first equation is greater

Verdict: B_HAS_ERRORS

The correct JSON response should be:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}
