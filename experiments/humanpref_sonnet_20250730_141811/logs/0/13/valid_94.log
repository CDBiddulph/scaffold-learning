Response A is correct. The 20th century technically ran from January 1, 1901 to December 31, 2000 (not 1999, as many people mistakenly believe). So the last valid date/second of the 20th century would be December 31, 2000, at 23:59:59.

Response B incorrectly states the last date as December 31, 1999, which is not accurate. This is a common misconception stemming from the millennium celebrations, but mathematically and historically, the 20th century ended on December 31, 2000.
