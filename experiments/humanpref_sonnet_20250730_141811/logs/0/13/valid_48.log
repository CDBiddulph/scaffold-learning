Original prompt: Explain ELI5 like I was five

Response A:
ELI5 stands for "Explain Like I'm 5 (years old)". It's a way of asking someone to explain a complex concept in a simple, easy to understand manner. When a topic is described in an ELI5 way, it means:

• Use simple terms and avoid complicated jargon. Explain things in a straightforward, conversational way.

• Break down complex ideas into small, simple steps or analogies. Provide examples and metaphors to illustrate your points.

• Focus on the core, most important elements. Avoid unnecessary details and tangents. Keep the explanation concise while still being thorough. 

• Assume limited prior knowledge. Explain any key terms or concepts that are needed to understand the main answer. Provide context and background.

• Use an informal, friendly tone. Speak simply as if talking to a child, not in a condescending way. 

The goal of an ELI5 explanation is to make a topic clear and accessible to everyone, even those with little to no understanding of the subject. It aims to demystify complicated ideas by stripping away unnecessary complexity, while still conveying the core essence and meaning.

So in short, explaining something "like you're five" means using simple, friendly language and lots of examples to make a complex topic easy to understand!

Response B:
Sure, I'd be happy to! 

ELI5 stands for "Explain Like I'm 5." It's a way of explaining things in a really simple way that a 5-year-old could understand. So, if someone says "ELI5," it means they want you to explain something to them in a way that's easy to understand and doesn't use big or complicated words.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
