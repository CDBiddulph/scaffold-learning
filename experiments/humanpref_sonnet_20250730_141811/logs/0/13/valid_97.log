2025-07-31 01:16:33,652 [INFO] Accuracy check: Let me review both responses carefully:

Response A contains a straightforward, factually accurate statement about KLUC-FM's location in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Response B contains the location information from Response A, and adds additional details about the station's music format, broadcasting history, and events. While these details appear to be true, I can't definitively verify every specific claim without additional research.

However, there are no clear factual errors or misconceptions in either response. Both responses correctly identify Las Vegas as the station's location.

Therefore, my assessment is: BOTH_ACCURATE

The responses provide consistent information about KLUC-FM's location, and Response B simply provides more contextual details about the radio station.
