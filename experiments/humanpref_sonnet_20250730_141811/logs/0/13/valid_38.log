Response A contains an overly cautious and incorrect interpretation of copyright law. Creating parody or transformative works is generally protected under fair use doctrine in copyright law. Parodies like "Weird Al" Yankovic's are legally permissible and do not require permission from the original artist. The response erroneously suggests that any alteration of copyrighted material is not allowed, which is not true.

Response B does not contain factual errors. It provides a humorous parody of the song as requested, and the explanation acknowledges the parody's style and intent.
