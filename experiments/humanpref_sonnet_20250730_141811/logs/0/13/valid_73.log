Specific issues with Response A:

1. The response appears to be completely fabricated. Omnivore is a read-it-later app/service for saving and organizing articles, not an email marketing platform.

2. The detailed steps about creating email campaigns, workflows, and sending newsletters do not match Omnivore's actual functionality.

3. The instructions are entirely fictitious and do not represent how Omnivore actually works.

Response B, while more generic, does not specifically describe Omnivore's true functionality, but it does not contain as many explicit false claims as Response A.

The correct way to add a newsletter to Omnivore would likely involve using the email forwarding feature to send newsletter emails to your Omnivore account for reading and archiving, not creating or sending newsletters.

The core error in Response A is presenting completely invented instructions as if they were factual steps for using Omnivore.
