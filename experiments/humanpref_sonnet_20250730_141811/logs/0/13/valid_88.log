=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: List 5 games made in Microsoft QBasic and describe them.

Response A:
1. **BASIC Warrior** - This is a simple text-based adventure game where you play as a warrior who must navigate a series of challenges and battles to save the kingdom. The game is played entirely through text input and responses, with descriptions of rooms and encounters.

2. **Space Invaders Clone** - Many QBasic programmers created their own versions of classic arcade games, including Space Invaders. These clones typically involve shooting down rows of advancing alien spaceships while avoiding their fire.

3. **Frogger Clone** - Another classic arcade game that has been recreated in QBasic is Frogger. The objective is to guide a frog to its home across a busy road and a river filled with hazards, such as cars and alligators.

4. **Roguelike Dungeon Crawlers** - QBasic was popular for creating simple roguelike games, where the player explores a randomly generated dungeon, fights monsters, and finds treasure. These games often have permadeath, meaning if your character dies, you have to start over.

5. **Tetris Clone** - Tetris is another arcade game that has been replicated in QBasic. Players must rotate and drop tetrominoes (shapes composed of four squares) into place to create full lines without letting the pieces reach the top of the screen.

Each of these games demonstrates the versatility of QBasic in creating simple yet engaging games. While the graphics and gameplay are relatively basic compared to modern games, they were popular among hobbyists and programmers learning the basics of game development.

Response B:
Unfortunately I do not have a comprehensive list of specific games made in QBasic. However, here is a general description of 5 hypothetical QBasic games:

1. Text adventure - An interactive fiction game where the player navigates through scenes and solves puzzles by typing text commands. The game would rely on text descriptions and simple ASCII art.

2. Platformer - A 2D side scrolling game where the player controls a character jumping over obstacles and enemies. The graphics would be simple block characters and environments.

3. Snake - The classic game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, trying to avoid running into the line or the edges. Simple keyboard commands would control the direction.

4. Pong - The classic 2D tennis game with a ball bouncing between two paddles controlled by each player. Simple physics would control ball movement.

5. Tetris clone - A falling block puzzle game where the player rotates and moves different shaped blocks as they fall to form complete rows and score points. Simple block characters and gravity physics.

The QBasic games would rely on keyboard input, ASCII/character graphics, and basic math/physics calculations to create fun and interactive games within the technical constraints of the programming language.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 01:15:03,853 [INFO] Prompt: List 5 games made in Microsoft QBasic and describe them....
2025-07-31 01:15:03,853 [INFO] Response A length: 1534
2025-07-31 01:15:03,853 [INFO] Response B length: 1285
2025-07-31 01:15:08,464 [INFO] Accuracy check: After carefully reviewing both responses, I conclude: BOTH_ACCURATE

Key observations:
- Both responses provide realistic and factually consistent descriptions of the types of games typically created in QBasic
- Response A provides more specific details about existing game types and QBasic game development
- Response B offers more generalized descriptions but does not contain factual errors
- The games described (Space Invaders, Tetris, text adventures, arcade game clones) are all legitimate examples of games programmed in QBasic during the late 1980s and early 1990s
- Both responses accurately characterize the technical limitations and graphical constraints of QBasic game development

The responses show nuanced understanding of QBasic's capabilities and the types of games hobbyist programmers would create using the language. Neither response contains clear factual errors or significant misconceptions about QBasic game development.

Answer: A

=== STDERR ===
2025-07-31 01:15:13,809 [INFO] Instruction following check: Let's analyze the responses:

Response A:
- Directly lists 5 specific games
- Provides a detailed description for each game
- Demonstrates games actually made in QBasic
- Follows the prompt's exact requirements

Response B:
- Lists 5 games, but they are hypothetical
- Descriptions are more generic
- Does not specifically confirm these were real QBasic games
- Less detailed descriptions
- Still provides a general overview of potential QBasic games

Criteria Evaluation:
- Specificity: Response A is more specific
- Accuracy: Response A describes real QBasic games
- Completeness: Response A provides more detailed descriptions
- Prompt Adherence: Response A more closely follows the original request

Therefore, the response that better follows the specific instructions in the prompt is:

A_BETTER

Reasoning: Response A provides concrete, real examples of QBasic games with substantive descriptions, directly addressing the prompt's requirements, while Response B offers more generalized, hypothetical game concepts.
