Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-30 22:13:12,178 [INFO] Successfully parsed - Prompt: 212 chars, A: 66 chars, B: 70 chars
2025-07-30 22:13:16,496 [INFO] LLM returned: 'A

Reasoning:
1. Instruction following: Response A correctly calculates the values (5 and 6.5), while Response B uses the original equation notation, which doesn't fully meet the prompt's request for actual values.
2. Accuracy: Response A correctly calculates the values for both equations.
3. Helpfulness: Response A provides the clear numerical results as requested.
4. Appropriateness: Response A uses the exact JSON structure implied by the prompt.
5. Quality: Response A shows more precise understanding of the prompt's requirements.

The key difference is that Response A calculates the actual values (5 for (10+5)/3 and 6.5 for (10+3)/2), while Response B leaves the equations unexpanded. Response A also correctly identifies "B" as the greater equation, which matches the mathematical calculation.'
