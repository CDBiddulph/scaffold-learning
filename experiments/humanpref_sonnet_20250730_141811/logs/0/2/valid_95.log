Original prompt: what happens in node 18 if you don't handle a promise and there's an exception

Response A:
In Node 18, if you don't handle a promise and there's an exception, it will result in an unhandled promise rejection. This can lead to potential issues, such as memory leaks and unexpected application behavior. It is important to handle promise rejections using the .catch() method or the use of async/await to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately.

Response B:
In Node.js version 18, if you don't handle a Promise and there's an exception, the unhandled rejection behavior remains the same as in previous versions. When a Promise is rejected and there is no corresponding `.catch()` handler to handle the rejection, Node.js will print an error message to the console indicating an unhandled rejection. If this issue is not addressed, it may cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.

Here's an example:

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw new Error('Unhandled Rejection');
});

console.log('This line will be printed');
```

In this case, you would see the following output:

```
(node:12345) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): Error: Unhandled Rejection
(node:12345) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
This line will be printed
```

As the warning message indicates, starting from Node.js 14, unhandled promise rejections will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code in the future. To avoid this, always add a `.catch()` handler to handle any possible rejections.

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  throw new Error('Unhandled Rejection');
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error caught:', error);
});

console.log('This line will be printed after the promise is handled');
```

This way, you can properly handle the rejection and prevent the application from terminating unexpectedly.
