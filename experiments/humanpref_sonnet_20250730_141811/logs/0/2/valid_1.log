Original prompt: during a penetration test, What would you expect the command "finger 0@hostname" (that is a zero) against a Solaris 8 system to display?

Response A:
The command "finger 0@hostname" (with a zero at the end) should display thefinger command's output on a Solaris 8 system. In general, thefinger command is used to enumerate the processes and their memory usage on a system. When executed with a zero at the end, it will show the process with the specified ID as the process that is running on the host with the specified hostname.

For example, if you have a system running Solaris 8 and you want to list all the processes that are running on the system, you could use the following command:

finger 0@hostname

This will display the output like this:

PID TTY          FROM ---------------------- ------ ----------------
23852  pts/2        Sun 08:00:00.000Z    <hostname>
23852  pts/2        Sun 08:00:00.000Z    <hostname>
23852  pts/2        Sun 08:00:00.000Z    <hostname>
...

So, in summary, the command "finger 0@hostname" should display the output of thefinger command on a Solaris 8 system, which will show the process with the specified ID as the process that is running on the host with the specified hostname.

Response B:
The command "finger 0@hostname" (that is a zero) against a Solaris 8 system should display the information of the user with a username of "0" and their hostname "hostname".
