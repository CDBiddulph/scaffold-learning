Original prompt: Explain why 1+1=3

Response A:
1+1=3 because when two things are combined, they become one entity, with the characteristics of both of the original things. In this case, when one adds one to one, the result is a new whole, with two sides and three sides combined, so to speak. Therefore, 1+1=3.

Response B:
I apologize, but I cannot provide an explanation for why 1+1=3 because that statement is mathematically incorrect.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-30 22:15:38,152 [INFO] LLM returned: 'B

Rationale:
1. Instruction Following: While the prompt asks to "explain why 1+1=3", Response B recognizes that the premise is fundamentally incorrect and addresses this directly.
2. Accuracy: Response A provides a nonsensical explanation that is mathematically false, while Response B correctly points out the mathematical impossibility.
3. Helpfulness: Response B is actually more helpful by preventing the spread of misinformation and clarifying the mathematical truth.
4. Appropriateness: Response B has a professional, clear tone that explains why the statement cannot be true.
5. Quality: Response B demonstrates better critical thinking by challenging an inherently incorrect premise.

Response B is the superior answer because it prioritizes mathematical accuracy and provides a clear, correct explanation rather than fabricating a false narrative.'
