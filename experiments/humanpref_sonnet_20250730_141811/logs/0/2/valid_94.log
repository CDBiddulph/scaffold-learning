2025-07-30 22:20:03,542 [INFO] LLM returned: 'A

Reasoning:
1. Instruction following: Both are solid, but Response A is more precise.
2. Accuracy: Response A is correct. The 20th century technically ended on December 31, 2000 (not 1999), as centuries start at year 1 and end at year 100/1000/etc.
3. Helpfulness: Response A provides the mathematically/historically accurate date.
4. Appropriateness: Response A uses a clear, concise format matching the prompt's specificity.
5. Quality: Response A shows deeper understanding of calendar/century calculations.

Response B incorrectly uses 1999 as the end of the 20th century, which is a common but technically incorrect assumption. Response A correctly identifies 2000 as the final year/date of the 20th century.'
