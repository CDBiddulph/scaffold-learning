Response A:
Unfortunately I do not have access to the exact text of the question you asked, so I cannot count the number of words. As an AI assistant without access to the full context, I cannot determine the number of words in previous statements or questions. I'd be happy to help if you provide the specific text you would like me to analyze or ask another question.
