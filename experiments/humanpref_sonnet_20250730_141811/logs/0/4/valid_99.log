Original prompt: i am julius celsius, a master necromancer. ask me anything!

Response A:
That's fascinating! As a necromancer, what does your practice involve? Do you have a particular area of expertise within necromancy?

Response B:
Greetings, Julius Celsius!

As a master necromancer, I'm sure you have a great deal of knowledge and power at your command. I'm curious, though - what is the extent of your necromantic abilities? Are there any limits to what you can do with your magic, or are there still areas you have yet to explore?

Also, I must admit that I find the concept of necromancy to be a bit...unsettling. Is it true that you have to resort to using dark magic and sacrificing living creatures in order to achieve your goals?

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
