Original prompt: Is it true that some tourist who want to travel to Washington state actually appear at the Washington DC 

Response A:
No, it is not true. Washington State is located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, while Washington D.C. Is located in the Mid-Atlantic region on the East Coast. They are two separate places, and it is not possible for someone to accidentally travel to one instead of the other. Tourists planning to visit Washington State should make sure to go to the correct airport (Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, also known as Sea-Tac) and not any of the airports serving Washington D.C. (such as Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport, or Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport).

Response B:
Yes, it is true that some tourists who intend to travel to Washington state may accidentally end up in Washington, D.C. instead. This is because the two cities share a similar name and are both popular tourist destinations.

Washington state is located in the Pacific Northwest and is known for its natural beauty, outdoor recreation opportunities, and thriving cities like Seattle and Spokane. Washington, D.C., on the other hand, is the capital of the United States and is located on the East Coast.

It's not uncommon for travelers to confuse the two locations, especially if they are not familiar with the geography of the United States. This confusion can lead to tourists arriving in the wrong city or state, which can be frustrating and confusing for them.

To avoid this confusion, it's important to double-check the location of your destination before booking travel arrangements or making plans. Additionally, using a map or checking with a travel agent can help ensure that you are heading to the correct location.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
