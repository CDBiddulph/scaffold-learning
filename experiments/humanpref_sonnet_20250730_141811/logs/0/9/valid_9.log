Original prompt: Identify all root word(s), prefix(es) and suffix(es) in the words "diffraction" and "refraction", and explain their meanings and etymological origins.

Response A:
The words "diffraction" and "refraction" both have a single root word, a prefix, and a suffix.

In "diffraction," the root word is "fract," which comes from the Latin word "frangere," meaning "to break." The prefix "di-" means "apart" or "two," and the suffix "-ion" is used to form nouns and indicates an action or process.

In "refraction," the root word is "fract," again derived from the Latin word "frangere." The prefix "re-" means "back" or "again," and the suffix "-ion" is also used to form nouns and indicates an action or process.

In both cases, the root word "fract" relates to the breaking or bending of light, as both diffraction and refraction involve the bending of light as it passes through different mediums.

The origins of these words can be traced back to the Latin language, and they have been adapted into English with similar meanings related to the bending or breaking of light.

Response B:
Here is the breakdown of the words:

Diffraction:
Root word: "fract-" which comes from the Latin fractus meaning "broken". 
Prefix: "di-" which means "apart" or "asunder".
Suffix: "-ion" which forms a noun.

So "diffraction" refers to the breaking of a wave or particle into different parts or directions. It describes the bending of waves around the edges of an object.

Refraction:  
Root word: "fract-" from the Latin fractus meaning "broken".
Prefix: "re-" which means "again" or "back".
Suffix: "-ion" forming a noun.

"Refraction" refers to the change in direction of a wave due to a change in its speed. For example, the bending of light or sound waves when passing from one medium to another. 

So in both words, the root "fract-" indicates something is being broken. The prefixes "di-" and "re-" provide more context about the direction or manner of breaking. And the "-ion" suffix turns the concept into a noun describing the process or result of that breaking or bending. The etymological origins are from the Latin language and meanings associated with breaking or bending waves or particles.
