Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,

2025-07-30 23:54:51,446 [INFO] LLM judgment: LET'S EVALUATE SYSTEMATICALLY:

1. CORRECTNESS:
- RESPONSE A: 
  * (10+5)/3 = 15/3 = 5 ✓
  * (10+3)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5 ✓
- RESPONSE B: 
  * USES SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION INSTEAD OF CALCULATED VALUE
  * RESULT TECHNICALLY CORRECT BUT LESS CLEAR

2. INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING:
- RESPONSE A: PERFECTLY FOLLOWS JSON FORMAT, PROVIDES CLEAR NUMERIC VALUES
- RESPONSE B: SLIGHTLY LESS PRECISE, USES SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION

3. HELPFULNESS:
- RESPONSE A: IMMEDIATELY CLEAR AND READABLE
- RESPONSE B: REQUIRES EXTRA MENTAL COMPUTATION

4. APPROPRIATENESS:
- RESPONSE A: DIRECT, CONCISE, MATCHES EXPECTED JSON OUTPUT
- RESPONSE B: SLIGHTLY MORE VERBOSE

5. COMPLETENESS:
- BOTH RESPONSES PROVIDE THE CORE REQUESTED INFORMATION
- RESPONSE A IS MORE COMPLETE IN TERMS OF ACTUAL COMPUTED VALUES

WEIGHING THESE FACTORS, RESPONSE A IS OBJECTIVELY BETTER. IT PROVIDES CLEAR, COMPUTED VALUES, FOLLOWS THE JSON FORMAT PRECISELY, AND IS MOST HELPFUL TO UNDERSTANDING THE COMPARISON.
