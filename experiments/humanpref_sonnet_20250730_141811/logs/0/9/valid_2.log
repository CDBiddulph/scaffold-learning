Original prompt: Why was BERT trained on next sentence prediction and masked language modeling? Wouldn't there be many more tasks that could be used for training these models?

Response A:
BERT was trained on next sentence prediction and masked language modeling tasks as these two tasks provide a robust framework for understanding language in context, which is crucial for many downstream tasks.

1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM): In this task, the model is trained to predict a word given the context from both left and right of the word. This enables the model to understand the context of a word and its relationship with other words in the sentence. This is different from traditional language modelling where only the left context or right context is taken into account.

2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): This task is used to understand the relationship between two sentences which helps the model to grasp the coherence of a text. This is particularly useful for tasks like question answering and text summarization which require understanding the whole context.

While there could be many more tasks that could be used for training these models, the choice of tasks often comes down to computational resources and the end-task performance. MLM and NSP are chosen because they are computationally efficient and provide a good trade-off between performance and resources. They also cover a wide range of language understanding capabilities that are transferable to many downstream tasks.

Response B:
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was trained on two main tasks: next sentence prediction (NSP) and masked language modeling (MLM). These tasks were chosen because they help the model learn various aspects of language that are crucial for understanding and generating text.

1. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):**
   - This task is designed to capture the coherence and relationship between sentences in a paragraph. During training, BERT is fed with pairs of sentences, and the model learns to predict whether the second sentence is the true next sentence in the context of the first sentence or not. This helps BERT understand the structure and flow of language, which is important for tasks like question answering and summarization.

2. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):**
   - In this task, BERT is trained to predict the original version of a sentence where some percentage of the words have been randomly masked out. The model has to learn the relationships between the words in a sentence to be able to predict the correct masked tokens. This task helps BERT understand the context of words and their relationships, which is essential for tasks like machine translation and text generation.

BERT's creators chose these tasks because they believed they would be beneficial for the model to learn general-purpose representations of language. The model can then be fine-tuned for a wide variety of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or natural language inference, by adapting the pre-trained model to the specific task at hand.

While there are many other tasks that could be used for training language models, NSP and MLM were selected because they are generic enough to capture a wide range of linguistic knowledge yet specific enough to be useful for a variety of NLP tasks. Additionally, these tasks can be easily applied to a large corpus of text, which is necessary for training a model as complex as BERT.
