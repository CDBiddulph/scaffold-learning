RATIONALE:

2. INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING: BOTH DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE PROMPT ✓
3. HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE B IS MORE CONCRETELY HELPFUL BY EMPHASIZING GETTING PAID FASTER
4. APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE B FEELS MORE CRISP AND BILLBOARD-APPROPRIATE WITH ITS DIRECT LANGUAGE
5. COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE B PROVIDES A CLEAR VALUE PROPOSITION IN A SUCCINCT MANNER
