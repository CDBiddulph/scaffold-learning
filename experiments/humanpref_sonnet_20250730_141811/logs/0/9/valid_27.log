1. Provide answers to factual questions based on the knowledge I have been trained on.

2. Help in finding information, products or services, and providing suggestions.

3. Assist in organizing your day by creating a to-do list, setting reminders, or finding local services.

4. Offer writing assistance by generating text, editing documents, or helping with composing emails and letters.

5. Perform simple mathematical calculations and unit conversions.

6. Help with language translation between multiple supported languages.
