Original prompt: Write a poem about John wick shopping at Whole Foods. 

Response A:
John Wick walked down the aisle
With a gun in his belt and a soul on a wheel
He needed groceries, nothing more
But the task at hand seemed to be a chore

He scanned the shelves, looking for what he wanted
Organic produce and grass-fed beef, no antibiotics
He wanted the best for his body and soul
But the prices were steep, and he had to roll

He reached for a jar of artisanal pickles
And a bottle of olive oil from Italy
He added them to his cart, with a sigh
And continued down the aisle, ready to die

He found himself in the meat department
Where the butchers cut and slice with precision
He chose a cut of steak, and asked for a trim
And the butcher nodded, with a twinkle in his limb

John Wick paid for his goods, and walked out the door
With a bag full of groceries, and a heart full of floor
He knew he had made the right choice
To shop at Whole Foods, and feel alive.

Response B:
In Whole Foods one day, John Wick did appear
Looking for some groceries, his shopping to steer
He walked down the aisles with a purpose so clear
Picking up his items, without any fear

The produce section, he eyed with a glare
Choosing his vegetables with the utmost care
Fresh fruits and greens, he would not spare
Only the best for his body to repair

As he walked through the store, he could feel the stares
Of those who recognized him and his famous wares
But John kept his cool, with a face so square
His mission was simple, to buy some fine fare

Finally, his cart was filled to the brim
With organic products and snacks so slim
He checked out with ease, with a grin so dim
John Wick left Whole Foods, with a healthy whim

For even assassins need to eat well
To keep their bodies in shape and excel
So, John Wick shopped at Whole Foods, with no sell
And left with a cart full, of foods so swell.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
