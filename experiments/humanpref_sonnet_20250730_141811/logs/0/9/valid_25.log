Original prompt: Write a short rap in the style of Eminem about oranges

Response A:
Here's a try at an Eminem-style rap about oranges:

Yo, listen up to my citrus flow
Spittin' rhymes 'bout oranges that glow
Sweet like candy, the juice just burstin' 
Out the peel when I give it a good squirtin'
I'm cravin' oranges early in the mornin'
Eat 'em whole, no time for warnin' 
Got no seeds, easy to chew
Pulp gets stuck all in my teeth too
Call me Orange M&M, I'm the real Slim Shady
Reppin' vitamin C up in sunny Florida already
Got a whole crate, freshly picked from the tree
Enough oranges to fill up the whole dang sea
So just relax as I lay down these funky fresh rhymes
'Bout my favorite fruit of all time!

Response B:
(Verse 1)
Yo, it's Slim Shady, kickin' it with these rhymes,
Talkin' 'bout oranges, it's citrus time.
Peel back the skin, expose the truth,
Oranges be packin' that vitamin C juice.

Chorus:
Oranges, oranges, so bright,
Eatin' 'em in the morning, eating 'em at night,
Slice 'em, juice 'em, straight from the tree,
Oranges, oranges, set your health free.

(Verse 2)
Straight from the grove, no preservatives,
Eatin' oranges, that's how we live.
Every section is a burst of delight,
With each bite, we're bringing the light.

Chorus:
Oranges, oranges, so bright,
Eatin' 'em in the morning, eating 'em at night,
Slice 'em, juice 'em, straight from the tree,
Oranges, oranges, set your health free.

(Outro)
So here's Eminem, signing off the mic,
With a citrus rap, that's outta sight.
Remember, kids, eat your fruit, stay in school,
Oranges and education, that's the real cool.
