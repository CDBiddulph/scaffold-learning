Original prompt: Explain why 1+1=3

Response A:
1+1=3 because when two things are combined, they become one entity, with the characteristics of both of the original things. In this case, when one adds one to one, the result is a new whole, with two sides and three sides combined, so to speak. Therefore, 1+1=3.

Response B:
I apologize, but I cannot provide an explanation for why 1+1=3 because that statement is mathematically incorrect.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

RATIONALE:
1. CORRECTNESS: RESPONSE B IS MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE, WHILE RESPONSE A PROVIDES A NONSENSICAL AND FACTUALLY WRONG EXPLANATION.
2. INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING: RESPONSE B DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMATIC PREMISE OF THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT.
3. HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE B PREVENTS POTENTIAL MATHEMATICAL MISCONCEPTION BY CLEARLY STATING THE ERROR.
4. APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE B MAINTAINS A PROFESSIONAL, CLEAR TONE SUITABLE FOR ADDRESSING A MATHEMATICAL CLAIM.
5. COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE B SUCCINCTLY AND DEFINITIVELY ANSWERS WHY THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT IS INCORRECT.

RESPONSE A ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A CONVOLUTED PSEUDO-PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLANATION THAT IS MATHEMATICALLY ABSURD. IN CONTRAST, RESPONSE B PROVIDES A PRECISE, CORRECT REJECTION OF THE FALSE MATHEMATICAL CLAIM, WHICH IS THE MOST RESPONSIBLE AND HELPFUL APPROACH WHEN CONFRONTED WITH AN INCORRECT STATEMENT.
