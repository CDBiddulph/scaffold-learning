Original prompt: I'm an macOS. How do I print the width and height of a PNG file in my terminal?

Response A:
To print the width and height of a PNG file in your macOS terminal, you can use the `sips` command-line tool. Follow these steps:

1. Open your Terminal application (can be found in Applications > Utilities > Terminal).

2. Navigate to the directory where the PNG file is located. You can use the `cd` command followed by the path to the directory. For example, if the file is located on your desktop, you can use:

```
cd ~/Desktop
```

3. Once you are in the correct directory, use the following command to display the width and height of the PNG file:

```
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight <filename.png>
```

Replace `<filename.png>` with the actual name of the PNG file you want to check.

4. Press Enter to execute the command. The terminal will display the width and height values of the PNG file in pixels.

Note: The `sips` command is a built-in utility in macOS that allows you to script and manipulate images.

Response B:
To print the width and height of a PNG file in your macOS terminal, you can use the `sips` command. Open the terminal and type the following command:

```bash
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight /path/to/your/image.png
```

Replace `/path/to/your/image.png` with the actual path to your PNG file. This command will output the width and height of the image like this:

```
/path/to/your/image.png
  pixelWidth: <width>
  pixelHeight: <height>
```

where `<width>` and `<height>` will be the actual dimensions of your PNG file.
