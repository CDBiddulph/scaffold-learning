Original prompt: If a train leaves the station at 3:00 PM traveling at 60 miles per hour, and another train leaves the same station at 4:00 PM traveling in the same direction at 80 miles per hour, at what time will the second train catch up to the first train?

Response A:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula Distance = Speed × Time.

Let's assume that the second train catches up to the first train after t hours since the second train leaves the station. 

By the time the second train catches up to the first train, the first train has been traveling for t + 1 hours.

The distance traveled by the first train is 60 × (t + 1) miles.
The distance traveled by the second train is 80 × t miles.

Since the distance traveled by both trains is the same when the second train catches up to the first train, we can set up the equation:

60(t + 1) = 80t

Solving for t:

60t + 60 = 80t
60 = 20t
t = 3

So, the second train will catch up to the first train after 3 hours. If the second train leaves at 4:00 PM, it will catch up to the first train at 7:00 PM.

Response B:
Let's use relative speed to solve this problem.

When the second train leaves the station, the first train has been traveling for 1 hour and has gone 60 miles. Let's call this distance "x" because we want to find out when the second train catches up to the first train, not where the first train is when the second train leaves.

The second train is traveling at 80 mph, so in 1 hour, it will travel 80 miles. This means that in 1 hour, the gap between the two trains has decreased by 80 miles.

So, the second train will catch up to the first train after 1 hour, when the gap between them is 0 miles.
