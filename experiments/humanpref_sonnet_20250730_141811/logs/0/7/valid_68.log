Original prompt: f you put a flame with table salt added in front of a vapour sodium lamp, the flame casts a shadow. The shadow can become lighter, if the flame is put into a strong magnetic field. Assume that the shadow becoming lighter is caused by the Zeeman effect of the sodium D-line. Write the lab report on the experiment, including introduction, experimental setup with a detailed descrtiption of the apparatus, methods section, results and conclusion.

Response A:
Title: Investigating the Zeeman Effect on Sodium D-line Using a Magnetic Field and Table Salt

Introduction:
The Zeeman effect is a phenomenon in which the spectral lines of an atom are split into two or more components due to the application of a magnetic field. This effect is named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, who first observed it in 1902. In this experiment, we aim to observe the Zeeman effect on the sodium D-line by introducing a flame containing table salt in front of a vapor sodium lamp and placing it in a strong magnetic field. The flame casts a shadow, and we hypothesize that the shadow will become lighter when exposed to the magnetic field due to the Zeeman effect splitting the sodium D-line.

Experimental Setup:
The experimental setup consisted of a vapor sodium lamp (1) placed on a stable and level surface. A flame (2) containing table salt was positioned in front of the lamp, approximately 30 cm away. The flame was generated using a standard bunsen burner (3) equipped with a ceramic nozzle and a heat-resistant glass tube. The bunsen burner was filled with a propane and butane gas mixture, and the table salt was introduced into the flame by sprinkling it onto the nozzle. The flame and lamp were positioned such that the shadow of the flame was cast onto a white screen (4) located behind the lamp. The screen was used to observe the changes in the shadow's intensity.

A strong magnetic field was produced by a powerful electromagnet (5) placed beneath the experimental setup. The electromagnet was connected to a variable power supply (6), which allowed for the control of the magnetic field strength. The electromagnet's core was constructed from a ferromagnetic material, ensuring a strong and focused magnetic field.

Methods:
1. The vapor sodium lamp was turned on and allowed to reach a stable state.
2. The bunsen burner was ignited, and the flame containing table salt was positioned in front of the lamp.
3. The shadow of the flame was observed on the white screen and noted.
4. The electromagnet was then activated, and the magnetic field strength was gradually increased while observing the flame's shadow on the screen.
5. The changes in the shadow's intensity were recorded as the magnetic field strength was increased.

Results:
Upon observing the flame's shadow on the white screen, it was noted that the shadow became lighter as the magnetic field strength was increased. The shadow's intensity decreased gradually as the magnetic field was applied, indicating that the Zeeman effect was causing the sodium D-line to split and reduce the absorption of light by the salt particles in the flame. The effect was most noticeable at higher magnetic field strengths, where the shadow was significantly lighter compared to when the magnetic field was not present.

Conclusion:
In this experiment, we successfully observed the Zeeman effect on the sodium D-line by introducing a flame containing table salt in front of a vapor sodium lamp and placing it in a strong magnetic field. The shadow of the flame on the white screen became lighter as the magnetic field strength was increased, demonstrating the splitting of the sodium D-line due to the Zeeman effect. This experiment provides a clear visual representation of the Zeeman effect and its impact on the absorption of light by sodium atoms in a flame.

Response B:
Title: Investigation of the Zeeman Effect on Sodium D-lines using a Flame and Magnetic Field

Introduction:
The Zeeman effect is a phenomenon in which the spectral lines of an atom are split into multiple components when it is exposed to a magnetic field. This effect was first observed by the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman in 1896. In this experiment, we aim to investigate the Zeeman effect on the sodium D-lines by observing the shadow cast by a flame in front of a sodium vapor lamp. We will also examine how the shadow changes when the flame is placed in a strong magnetic field.

Experimental Setup:

Apparatus:

1. Sodium vapor lamp
2. Table salt
3. Bunsen burner
4. Magnetic field source (e.g. electromagnet or permanent magnet)
5. Power supply
6. Camera (optional)

Description of the Apparatus:

1. Sodium vapor lamp: A sodium vapor lamp is a type of gas discharge lamp that produces light by ionizing sodium atoms. The lamp emits a yellow-orange light, which is characteristic of the sodium D-lines.
2. Table salt: Table salt (sodium chloride) is added to the flame to introduce sodium atoms.
3. Bunsen burner: A Bunsen burner is used to produce the flame.
4. Magnetic field source: A magnetic field source is used to generate a strong magnetic field around the flame. In this experiment, we used an electromagnet powered by a DC power supply.
5. Power supply: A DC power supply is used to provide power to the electromagnet.
6. Camera: A camera is used to capture images of the shadow cast by the flame. This is optional, but can be useful for analyzing the results.

Methods:

1. Set up the sodium vapor lamp and the magnetic field source as shown in Figure 1.
2. Add a small amount of table salt to the Bunsen burner.
3. Light the Bunsen burner and adjust the flame so that it is stable and conical.
4. Observe the shadow cast by the flame in front of the sodium vapor lamp.
5. Increase the magnetic field strength by adjusting the current to the electromagnet.
6. Observe any changes in the shadow cast by the flame.
7. Take images of the shadow at different magnetic field strengths.

Results:

When the flame was in the absence of a magnetic field, a dark shadow was observed in front of the sodium vapor lamp. As the magnetic field strength was increased, the shadow became lighter and less distinct. The images taken at different magnetic field strengths are shown in Figure 2.

Conclusion:

The results of this experiment support the hypothesis that the Zeeman effect causes the splitting of the sodium D-lines in the presence of a magnetic field. The shadow cast by the flame became lighter as the magnetic field strength was increased, indicating that the sodium atoms in the flame were being affected by the magnetic field. This is consistent with the Zeeman effect, which predicts that the spectral lines of an atom will be split into multiple components when it is exposed to a magnetic field. The results of this experiment demonstrate the importance of the Zeeman effect in understanding the behavior of atoms in magnetic fields.
