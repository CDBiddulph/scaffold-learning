2025-07-30 23:39:13,033 [INFO] Evaluating responses for prompt: hello! please list every zone in pandaria. Then list every zone in the eastern kingdoms....
2025-07-30 23:39:13,033 [INFO] Response A length: 608
2025-07-30 23:39:13,033 [INFO] Response B length: 1385
2025-07-30 23:39:18,538 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 1: After carefully evaluating both responses, I choose "A" as the better response.

Reasoning:
- Relevance: Response A more accurately lists actual zones in Pandaria and Eastern Kingdoms
- Accuracy: Response A has fewer incorrect/non-existent zones compared to Response B
- Completeness: Response A provides a more concise and correct list of zones
- Format: Response A uses a clean, readable list format
- Tone: Response A is straightforward and helpful

Response B contains numerous errors:
- Includes many non-zone locations (like Shattrath City, Scarlet Monastery, various dungeons)
- Lists many zones that are not in Eastern Kingdoms
- Repeats zones with fictional "Horde-controlled" variations
- Goes far beyond the actual zones, listing 54 mostly incorrect entries

Response A, while not perfect (it has a few minor duplications), is significantly more accurate and useful for answering the original prompt.

Therefore, my evaluation is: A
2025-07-30 23:39:23,007 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 2: B

Reasoning:
- Accuracy: Response A includes several incorrect zones (e.g., Shadowmoon Valley, Skywall, Tanaris are not Pandaria zones)
- Completeness: Response B provides a more extensive list of zones
- Relevance: Response B stays closer to the original request
- Formatting: Response B uses a numbered list, making it easier to read

While Response B does include some incorrect or irrelevant zones (like instances and battlegrounds), it is still more accurate and comprehensive than Response A. Response A contains multiple zones that are not part of Pandaria or Eastern Kingdoms, making it less reliable.

The key weakness of Response B is the inclusion of some non-zone locations, but its overall accuracy and detail are superior to Response A.
2025-07-30 23:39:28,397 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 3: Let me carefully evaluate both responses:

RESPONSE A:
- Mostly relevant, but includes some incorrect/unrelated zones
- Contains some zones not in Pandaria (like Shadowmoon Valley, Skywall, Tanaris)
- Partially accurate for Pandaria zones
- Repeated some zones (Kun-Lai Summit twice)
- Eastern Kingdoms list includes many non-Eastern Kingdoms zones
- Fairly clear format
- Tone is polite

RESPONSE B:
- Contains many fictional/incorrect zones
- Includes zones from other continents and expansions
- Very inaccurate list for both Pandaria and Eastern Kingdoms
- Extremely long and rambling response
- Includes repeated zones and non-zone entries
- Confusing format with multiple "controlled" versions of zones
- Overall lacks precision and accuracy

While both responses have significant issues, Response A is closer to being correct. It at least includes most of the actual Pandaria zones and some genuine Eastern Kingdoms zones.

Therefore, my evaluation is:

A

2025-07-30 23:39:31,181 [INFO] Fallback evaluation: A

REASONING:
- RESPONSE A IS MORE ACCURATE TO THE ACTUAL ZONES IN PANDARIA AND EASTERN KINGDOMS
- RESPONSE B INCLUDES MANY INCORRECT ZONES, DUNGEONS, BATTLEGROUNDS, AND LOCATIONS THAT ARE NOT ACTUAL ZONES
- RESPONSE A LISTS EACH PANDARIA ZONE ONLY ONCE (EXCEPT KUN-LAI SUMMIT), WHILE B REPEATS ZONES AND INCLUDES NON-ZONES
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES A CLEANER, MORE CONCISE LIST CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL WORLD OF WARCRAFT ZONES
