If you want to automate the process of sending newsletters to your subscribers, you can also create an email workflow. This will allow you to set up a series of automated emails that will be sent to your subscribers at specific intervals. To create an email workflow, follow these steps:

To add a newsletter to your Omnivore account, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Omnivore account.

2. Navigate to the "Newsletters" section or a similar option in the dashboard.

4. Fill in the required information such as the newsletter name, description, and any other relevant details.

2025-07-30 23:35:43,368 [INFO] Response A length: 1377
2025-07-30 23:35:43,368 [INFO] Response B length: 818
2025-07-30 23:35:47,642 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 1: B

Reasoning:
- Relevance: Response B is more directly focused on adding a newsletter to Omnivore
- Accuracy: Response A appears to be fabricated and doesn't reflect actual Omnivore functionality
- Completeness: Response B provides clear, concise steps while acknowledging potential need for further support
- Format: Both responses use a numbered list format
- Tone: Response B is straightforward and practical
- Helpfulness: Response B provides realistic guidance without unnecessary elaboration

Response A seems to be entirely invented, with steps that do not match Omnivore's actual platform. Response B provides a more realistic and helpful approach to addressing the user's specific question about adding a newsletter.
2025-07-30 23:35:52,532 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 2: B

Reasoning:
- Response A appears to be fabricated and not based on actual Omnivore functionality. Omnivore is primarily a read-it-later and article saving app, not an email marketing platform.
- Response B is more generic but doesn't make up false steps, which is better than providing completely incorrect information.
- Response B suggests contacting customer support if unsure, which is a responsible approach.
- Both responses lack specific details about Omnivore's actual newsletter features, but B does not invent nonexistent functionality.
- The tone of Response B is more neutral and measured.

The key distinguishing factor is that Response A provides completely fictional instructions, while Response B, though vague, does not fabricate details about the service.
2025-07-30 23:35:58,580 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 3: I'll carefully evaluate both responses:

Relevance:
- Response A provides very detailed steps, but seems to be describing creating an email campaign/workflow, not adding a newsletter to Omnivore
- Response B provides more generic steps that seem closer to the actual intent of the original question

Accuracy:
- Response A appears to be fabricated, with steps that don't seem to match Omnivore's actual functionality
- Response B is more generic but doesn't make specific claims that could be false

Completeness:
- Response A is more verbose but not necessarily more accurate
- Response B acknowledges potential need for additional support if needed

Format:
- Both use clear, numbered step-by-step instructions
- Response B is more concise

Tone:
- Both are professional and instructional
- Response B is slightly more neutral

Helpfulness:
- Response A might actually mislead the user
- Response B provides general guidance without risking incorrect information

Given these considerations, Response B is more appropriate and likely closer to being genuinely helpful to the user.

My answer is: B
2025-07-30 23:36:01,295 [INFO] Fallback evaluation: B IS BETTER. 

WHILE BOTH RESPONSES PROVIDE STEPS TO ADD A NEWSLETTER, RESPONSE B IS MORE CONCISE, MORE REALISTIC, AND MORE ALIGNED WITH A TYPICAL USER EXPERIENCE. IT PROVIDES A GENERAL, STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH WITHOUT UNNECESSARILY DETAILED STEPS OR COMPLEX WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS. RESPONSE A SEEMS OVERLY ELABORATE AND INCLUDES STEPS THAT MAY NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT OMNIVORE'S ACTUAL NEWSLETTER CREATION PROCESS.
