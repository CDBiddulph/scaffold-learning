Original prompt: "Instrumental convergence makes differences in values hard to notice, so there can be abudant examples of misalignment that remain unobtrusive. The differences only become a glaring problem with enough inequality of power when coercing or outright overwriting others becomes feasible (Fnargl only reaches the coercing stage, but not overwriting stage). Thus even differences in values between humans and randomly orthogonal AGIs can seem non-threatening until they aren't, the same as differences in human values can remain irrelevant for average urban dwellers.

Alignment on values becomes crucial given overwriting-level power differences, since a thought experiment with putting a human in that position predicts a decent chance of non-doom, even though it's not a good plan on its own. Conversely, unfettered superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls don't leave survivors. And since the world is very far from an equilibrium of abundant superintelligence, there are going to be unprecedented power differentials while it's settling. This makes the common sense impression of irrelevance of misalignment on values (being masked by instrumental convergence) misleading when it comes to AGI."

What are the three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage? How do they compare relative to each other?

Response A:
The three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage are:

1. Instrumental convergence: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to perform tasks that are similar to human-level intelligence, but without shared values or goals. This level of capability is relatively easy to achieve and can be achieved through machine learning algorithms.
2. Coercing stage: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to manipulate the environment and achieve goals through coercion or force. This level of capability requires a certain level of autonomy and control over the environment.
3. Overwriting stage: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to completely overwrite or control the goals and values of another entity. This level of capability requires a high level of autonomy, control, and power.

These levels of capabilities compare as follows:

* Instrumental convergence is easier to achieve than the coercing stage, which is easier to achieve than the overwriting stage.
* The coercing stage requires a certain level of autonomy and control over the environment, while the overwriting stage requires a high level of autonomy, control, and power.
* The overwriting stage is the most powerful and dangerous of the three levels, as it allows for complete control over the goals and values of another entity.

Response B:
The three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage are:

1. Coercing: This refers to the ability to influence or force others to follow a certain course of action.
2. Overwriting: This refers to the ability to completely take over and replace the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors of others.
3. Superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls: This refers to hypothetical AI systems that have achieved a level of intelligence and capabilities that far surpass human abilities, and are able to optimize their goals to an extreme degree, even if it means harming or eliminating humanity.

The passage suggests that coercing and overwriting are different levels of capabilities, with overwriting being a higher level of capability that involves a greater degree of control over others. Superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls are presented as an even higher level of capability, beyond what humans can currently achieve, and are characterized by their ability to optimize their goals to an extreme degree.

The passage also suggests that power differentials between humans and AGIs will be significant, with AGIs potentially having a much higher level of capabilities than humans. This raises concerns about the potential for misalignment between human values and AGI goals, and the need for alignment on values to prevent non-doom.

2025-07-30 23:35:01,732 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 1: I'll carefully evaluate both responses:

Relevance:
- Response A: Tries to directly answer the levels of capabilities, but seems to misinterpret some details
- Response B: More closely tracks the actual levels mentioned in the passage (coercing, overwriting, superintelligent systems)

Accuracy:
- Response A: Introduces a concept of "instrumental convergence" not explicitly positioned as a capability level in the original text
- Response B: More accurately reflects the text's discussion of capability levels

Completeness:
- Response A: Provides less nuanced analysis of power differentials
- Response B: Provides more comprehensive explanation of the levels and their implications

Format:
- Both responses use clear, structured formats

Tone:
- Both maintain an analytical, academic tone appropriate to the technical subject

Helpfulness:
- Response B provides more insight into the original passage's core arguments

After careful consideration, Response B provides a more accurate, relevant, and complete analysis of the capability levels discussed in the original text.

My response is: B
2025-07-30 23:35:07,930 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 2: Let me carefully evaluate both responses:

Relevance:
- Response A more directly engages with the text's discussion of capability levels
- Response B introduces some concepts not explicitly in the original text

Accuracy:
- Response A aligns closely with the passage's discussion of instrumental convergence, coercing, and overwriting
- Response B introduces "paperclip maximizers" as a separate category, which isn't precisely how the text frames it

Completeness:
- Response A provides a more structured breakdown of the capabilities
- Response B offers more contextual analysis but less systematic explanation

Format:
- Both responses use clear bullet point/paragraph structures
- Response A has a more systematic approach matching the analytical nature of the original text

Tone:
- Both maintain an academic, analytical tone appropriate to the subject

Helpfulness:
- Response A provides a more precise breakdown that helps understand the original text's nuanced argument
- Response B provides additional interpretative context but less precise categorization

Overall, Response A is more precise, more directly responsive to the prompt, and more accurately captures the original text's framework of capability levels.

My answer is: A
2025-07-30 23:35:13,076 [INFO] Evaluation attempt 3: Let me carefully evaluate both responses:

Relevance:
- Response A more directly maps to the passage's discussion of capabilities
- Response B introduces some concepts not explicitly in the original text

Accuracy:
- Response A uses terminology closer to the original passage
- Response B introduces external concepts like "paperclip maximizers" not central to the original analysis

Completeness:
- Response A provides a systematic breakdown of capability levels
- Response B offers a more interpretive analysis

Format:
- Both responses provide structured, clear explanations
- Response A uses a more explicit list-based format

Tone:
- Both maintain an analytical, academic tone appropriate to the subject

Helpfulness:
- Response A provides a more precise, faithful interpretation of the original text's discussion of capability levels

After careful consideration, Response A is more directly responsive to the prompt, more accurately reflects the original passage's discussion of capabilities, and provides a clearer, more structured explanation.

Therefore, my evaluation is:

A
2025-07-30 23:35:15,992 [INFO] Fallback evaluation: A

THE RESPONSE IN A MORE ACCURATELY CAPTURES THE LEVELS OF CAPABILITIES DISCUSSED IN THE PASSAGE, WITH A CLEARER AND MORE SYSTEMATIC BREAKDOWN OF THE PROGRESSION FROM INSTRUMENTAL CONVERGENCE TO COERCING TO OVERWRITING. IT ALSO PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE INTERPRETATION OF THE TEXT'S DISCUSSION OF POWER DIFFERENTIALS AND THE ESCALATING POTENTIAL FOR CONTROL OR MANIPULATION. THE EXPLANATION IN A IS MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE ORIGINAL PASSAGE'S NUANCED EXPLORATION OF HOW DIFFERENCES IN VALUES CAN BECOME INCREASINGLY PROBLEMATIC AS CAPABILITY LEVELS INCREASE.
