2025-07-31 01:32:56,936 [WARNING] Unclear evaluation result: A

RATIONALE:
- BOTH RESPONSES ARE ACCURATE IN IDENTIFYING THAT "IT" REFERS TO THE APPLE
- RESPONSE A IS MORE COMPLETE AND HELPFUL BECAUSE IT:
  1. EXPLAINS THE AMBIGUITY OF THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE
  2. PROVIDES A CLEAR INTERPRETATION OF WHY THE APPLE DOES NOT FIT
  3. OFFERS ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ABOUT THE MEANING
- RESPONSE B, WHILE TECHNICALLY CORRECT, IS VERY BRIEF AND PROVIDES MINIMAL EXPLANATION
- RESPONSE A BETTER FOLLOWS THE SPIRIT OF THE INSTRUCTION BY GIVING A MORE THOROUGH AND EXPLANATORY ANSWER

THEREFORE, RESPONSE A IS THE BETTER ANSWER.
