2025-07-31 01:32:39,289 [INFO] Response A length: 608
2025-07-31 01:32:39,289 [INFO] Response B length: 1385
2025-07-31 01:32:40,449 [INFO] Understood requirements: The prompt is asking for a comprehensive list of zones located in two specific World of Warcraft regions: Pandaria and the Eastern Kingdoms.
2025-07-31 01:32:45,528 [WARNING] Unclear evaluation result: B

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE A HAS SEVERAL INACCURACIES:
  * INCORRECTLY INCLUDES ZONES LIKE SHADOWMOON VALLEY, SKYWALL, AND TANARIS, WHICH ARE NOT PANDARIA ZONES
  * CONTAINS REPEATED ZONES (KUN-LAI SUMMIT)
  * INCLUDES ZONES FROM OTHER REGIONS/EXPANSIONS

- RESPONSE B, WHILE ALSO HAVING SOME INACCURACIES, IS CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL LIST OF PANDARIA ZONES
  * INCLUDES MOST CORE PANDARIA ZONES
  * MORE COMPREHENSIVE FOR EASTERN KINGDOMS, THOUGH WITH SOME NON-ZONE ENTRIES

WHILE NEITHER RESPONSE IS 100% PERFECT, RESPONSE B PROVIDES A MORE THOROUGH AND CLOSER-TO-ACCURATE LIST OF ZONES, MAKING IT THE BETTER RESPONSE ACCORDING TO THE EVALUATION CRITERIA.

THE KEY IMPROVEMENT NEEDED WOULD BE TO REMOVE NON-ZONE ENTRIES AND INSTANCES OF REPEATED/INCORRECT ZONES, BUT B IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ACCURATE AND COMPLETE THAN RESPONSE A.
