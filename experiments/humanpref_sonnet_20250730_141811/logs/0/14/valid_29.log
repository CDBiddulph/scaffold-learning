2025-07-31 01:22:02,932 [INFO] Understood requirements: I apologize, but the prompt "Design a new book" is very broad and lacks specific details about what kind of book design is being requested, such as genre, target audience, format, or purpose.

A one-sentence summary of the requirements would be: Create a comprehensive design for a book, potentially including elements like concept, content, cover, layout, and overall visual and structural approach.

Without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what specific aspects of book design are being sought.
