- COMPLETENESS: PROVIDES A CLEAR, OPEN-ENDED INVITATION FOR FURTHER COMMUNICATION
- HELPFULNESS: OFFERS ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGES THE USER TO ELABORATE
- CLARITY: WELL-STRUCTURED AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND

RESPONSE B, WHILE GREETING IN GERMAN, IS LESS HELPFUL AS IT DOESN'T FULLY ENGAGE WITH THE POTENTIAL USER'S INTENT AND ASSUMES A SPECIFIC LANGUAGE PREFERENCE. RESPONSE A IS MORE VERSATILE AND USER-FRIENDLY.
