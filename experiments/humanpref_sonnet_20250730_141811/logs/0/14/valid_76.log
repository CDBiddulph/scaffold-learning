Original prompt: How many seacontainers are reported Losst every year?

Response A:
According to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 1,382 containers were lost at sea on average each year between 2008 and 2019. However, it's important to note that not all lost containers are reported, and the actual number may be higher. Additionally, some years may have more or fewer losses due to various factors, including weather conditions and shipping accidents.

Response B:
It is difficult to provide an exact number of seacontainers lost at sea each year, as the exact number can vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, shipping routes, and the quality of container ships. However, according to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 containers are lost at sea each year due to accidents, mishandling, and harsh weather conditions. It's important to note that this number is just an estimate and may not reflect the exact number of containers lost every year.

2025-07-31 01:31:11,635 [WARNING] Unclear evaluation result: A

RATIONALE:
1. ACCURACY: RESPONSE A PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE STATISTIC (1,382 CONTAINERS) FROM A CREDIBLE SOURCE (WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL), WHEREAS RESPONSE B GIVES A BROADER RANGE (5,000 TO 10,000) WHICH SEEMS LESS PRECISE.

2. INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING: BOTH RESPONSES ADDRESS THE CORE QUESTION ABOUT SEA CONTAINER LOSSES.

3. COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE A PROVIDES A SPECIFIC TIMEFRAME (2008-2019) AND ACKNOWLEDGES POTENTIAL REPORTING LIMITATIONS, MAKING IT MORE COMPREHENSIVE.

4. HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE A OFFERS A MORE SPECIFIC AND CREDIBLE NUMBER, WHICH IS MORE USEFUL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE SCALE OF CONTAINER LOSSES.

5. CLARITY: RESPONSE A IS CONCISELY WRITTEN AND CLEARLY EXPLAINS THE STATISTIC, MAKING IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND.

WHILE BOTH RESPONSES HAVE MERIT, RESPONSE A IS MORE PRECISE, CREDIBLE, AND INFORMATIVE, MAKING IT THE SUPERIOR ANSWER TO THE ORIGINAL PROMPT.
