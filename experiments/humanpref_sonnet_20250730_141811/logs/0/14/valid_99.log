Original prompt: i am julius celsius, a master necromancer. ask me anything!

Response A:
That's fascinating! As a necromancer, what does your practice involve? Do you have a particular area of expertise within necromancy?

Response B:
Greetings, Julius Celsius!

As a master necromancer, I'm sure you have a great deal of knowledge and power at your command. I'm curious, though - what is the extent of your necromantic abilities? Are there any limits to what you can do with your magic, or are there still areas you have yet to explore?

Also, I must admit that I find the concept of necromancy to be a bit...unsettling. Is it true that you have to resort to using dark magic and sacrificing living creatures in order to achieve your goals?

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 01:35:46,125 [WARNING] Unclear evaluation result: B

RATIONALE:
- INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING (BETTER): RESPONSE B MORE FULLY ENGAGES WITH THE ROLE-PLAY SCENARIO BY ASKING SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS THAT INVITE DEEPER EXPLORATION OF THE CHARACTER'S BACKGROUND AND CAPABILITIES.

- COMPLETENESS (BETTER): RESPONSE B ASKS MULTIPLE NUANCED QUESTIONS THAT PROBE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF NECROMANCY - ABILITIES, LIMITS, AND ETHICAL DIMENSIONS.

- HELPFULNESS (BETTER): THE QUESTIONS IN RESPONSE B ARE MORE THOUGHT-PROVOKING AND LIKELY TO GENERATE AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE RESPONSE FROM THE FICTIONAL CHARACTER.

- CLARITY (EQUAL): BOTH RESPONSES ARE CLEAR AND WELL-STRUCTURED.

- ACCURACY (EQUAL): BOTH RESPONSES APPROPRIATELY ENGAGE WITH THE FICTIONAL SCENARIO.

RESPONSE B SHOWS MORE DEPTH, CURIOSITY, AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ROLE-PLAY PREMISE, MAKING IT THE SUPERIOR RESPONSE.
