RATIONALE:
- ACCURACY: RESPONSE B IS CORRECT THAT THE 20TH CENTURY TECHNICALLY ENDED ON DECEMBER 31, 1999 AT 23:59:59.999, NOT IN 2000 AS RESPONSE A CLAIMS
- INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING: B PRECISELY ANSWERS THE PROMPT BY PROVIDING THE EXACT LAST SECOND OF THE 20TH CENTURY
- COMPLETENESS: B PROVIDES THE MOST PRECISE TIMESTAMP POSSIBLE
- HELPFULNESS: B GIVES THE TECHNICALLY CORRECT ANSWER THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND COUNTERINTUITIVE
- CLARITY: B IS CLEAR AND SPECIFIC

THE KEY DETAIL IS THAT THE 20TH CENTURY RAN FROM JANUARY 1, 1901 TO DECEMBER 31, 2000, MEANING ITS FINAL MOMENT WAS DECEMBER 31, 1999 AT 23:59:59.999. RESPONSE A INCORRECTLY SUGGESTS THE CUTOFF WAS IN 2000.
