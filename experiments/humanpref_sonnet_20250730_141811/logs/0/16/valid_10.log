Original prompt: There are n lockers in a hallway, numbered sequentially from 1 to n. Initially, all the locker doors are closed. You make n passes by the lockers, each time starting with locker #1. On the i th pass, i =1, 2, …… n, you toggle the door of every ith locker: if the door is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it. After the last pass, which locker doors are open and which are closed? How many of them are open?

Response A:
After the last pass, only the lockers with numbers that are perfect squares will have their doors open. This is because the door of a locker will be toggled every time its number is a factor of the pass number. For example, on the 2nd pass, locker #2 will be toggled, on the 3rd pass, locker #3 will be toggled, and so on. However, a locker will only be toggled an odd number of times if its number is a perfect square, since only then will it be a factor of its own pass number. Therefore, after the last pass, only the lockers with perfect square numbers will have their doors open.

To determine how many of them are open, we count the number of perfect squares between 1 and n (inclusive). The number of perfect squares between 1 and n is equal to the floor of the square root of  n. Hence, there are floor(√n) open locker doors.

Response B:
On the first pass, all locker doors are closed, so all doors are closed.

On the second pass, only locker #2 is open (since it was open on the first pass). All other lockers (#1, #3, ..., #n-1) are closed.

On the third pass, locker #3 is open (since it was open on the second pass), and all other lockers are closed.

On the nth pass, all lockers are open, except for the one that was open on the previous pass (in this case, locker #n-1).

So, after the last pass, all lockers are open except for locker #n-1, which is closed. In total, n-1 lockers are open, and only one locker (#n-1) is closed.
