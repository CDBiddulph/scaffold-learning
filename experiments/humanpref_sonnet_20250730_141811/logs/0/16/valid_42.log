Original prompt: major studies on recommended interval between mrna covid vaccines

Response A:
Several studies have been conducted to determine the optimal interval between mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses. 

One study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that extending the interval between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from three to six weeks resulted in higher antibody levels and a stronger immune response against the virus. 

Another study, published in The Lancet, found that an interval of 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine resulted in higher efficacy rates compared to an interval of less than six weeks. 

Based on these studies and others, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an interval of at least three weeks between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and at least four weeks between doses of the Moderna vaccine. However, the CDC also notes that individuals can receive their second dose up to six weeks after the first dose if necessary.

Response B:
It appears the current guidance in the UK and many other countries is to be vaccinated with a one year interval.

A number of large studies have been done looking at this with no clear consensus on the optimal interval. These studies include:

•	A study published in The Lancet in 2023 involving 1.5 million participants, which found there was no increased risk of adverse events at two year intervals compared to six month intervals.

•	A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2022 found that there was a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events at five year intervals.

•	A study published in The Lancet in 2021 found that, among 16 million participants, there was a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events at five year intervals.

•	A study published in The Lancet in 2020 found no increased risk of adverse events at five year intervals.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
