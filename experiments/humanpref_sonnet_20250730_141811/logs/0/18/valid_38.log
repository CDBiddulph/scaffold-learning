Original prompt: Alright, I'll create a parody version of "Lose Yourself" by Eminem, replacing some nouns with "dong" in a humorous way, akin to "Weird Al" Yankovic's style. I'll keep the changes light and in the spirit of fun:

---

Yo, his dong's are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, dong's spaghetti  
Yo, his dong's are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, dong's spaghetti
He's nervous

Response B:
Your parody version of "Lose Yourself" by Eminem is a humorous take on the original song, replacing some nouns with "dong" in a light-hearted manner. Here's the revised verse:

Yo, his dong's are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, dong's spaghetti  
Yo, his dong's are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy  
There's vomit on his sweater already, dong's spaghetti

He's nervous
