Original prompt: Write a poem about oranges

Response A:
Oranges are a sweet fruit
Their juice is refreshing for those parched in the summer sun
But oranges are also a secondary language
Their color is yellow and their sound is similar to the english word "no"

Response B:
Oranges, they come in all shapes and sizes,

From the small, sweet Valencia to the juicy Meadowlark,

Oranges, they bring a smile to your face,

Bringing sunshine to a cloudy day,

Oranges, they're good for your skin,

Good for your body, and good for your spirits,

Oranges, they're good for your health,

Good for your heart, and good for your mind.

So here's to the orange, the sweet and bright,

A fruit that brings us joy and delight.
