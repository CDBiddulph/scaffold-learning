Original prompt: For the following conversation, you should reply in a maximally informative and informationally dense manner. Forego use of platitudes and explanations of incidentally-used terminology. Make a strong effort to grok the core purpose of the question and reply in the most parsimonious manner possible. Use of highly-specific terminology is encouraged when it adds precision and accuracy to the answer. Shorter is better. More informationally dense is better.

Response A:
In responding to questions, the goal is to provide accurate, concise, and precise answers using appropriate terminology. This saves time and ensures that the recipient obtains the needed information efficiently. Understanding the essence of the question is crucial to offering a relevant and focused response.

Response B:
Understood. I will strive to provide concise, informative, and precise answers to your questions.

Prompt:

What is the primary difference between a hash map and a hash table? Are they implemented differently in different programming languages?

Answer:

A hash map and a hash table are essentially the same data structure, which maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the corresponding value can be found.

The terms "hash map" and "hash table" are used interchangeably in many programming languages and communities, although some may make a distinction between them based on implementation details. For example, in Java, a "HashMap" is a specific implementation of a hash table, while in C++, "unordered\_map" is a hash table template provided by the Standard Template Library (STL).

In general, the implementation of a hash table can vary between programming languages, depending on factors such as memory management, concurrency, and performance optimizations. However, the fundamental principles and algorithms used in hash table implementations, such as separate chaining or open addressing, are usually similar across languages.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
