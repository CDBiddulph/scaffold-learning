=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-30 22:02:16,962 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: 'LET ME EVALUATE SYSTEMATICALLY:

1. ACCURACY:
- RESPONSE A: CORRECT MATH
  (10+5)/3 = 15/3 = 5
  (10+3)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5
- RESPONSE B: MATHEMATICALLY VALID BUT DIDN'T SIMPLIFY VALUES

2. INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING:
- BOTH FOLLOW JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENT
- BOTH INCLUDE VALUES AND COMPARISON RESULT

3. HELPFULNESS:
- A PROVIDES SIMPLIFIED NUMERIC VALUES
- B LEAVES EQUATIONS UNSIMPLIFIED

4. HONESTY:
- BOTH ARE HONEST AND DIRECT

5. COMPLETENESS:
- A PROVIDES A SLIGHTLY CLEARER RESPONSE WITH SIMPLIFIED NUMBERS
- A CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES B'S EQUATION (6.5) IS GREATER

AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW, RESPONSE A IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE IT:
- PROVIDES SIMPLIFIED NUMERIC VALUES
- CORRECTLY CALCULATES AND COMPARES THE EQUATIONS
- IS MORE IMMEDIATELY READABLE/COMPREHENSIBLE

ANSWER: A'
