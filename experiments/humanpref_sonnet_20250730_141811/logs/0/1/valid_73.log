1. ACCURACY:

(SLIGHT ADVANTAGE TO B)

(ROUGHLY EQUAL)

3. HELPFULNESS:
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES MORE DETAILED STEPS, BUT THEY SEEM INVENTED
- RESPONSE B IS MORE GENERAL BUT SEEMS MORE HONEST
(SLIGHT ADVANTAGE TO A)

4. HONESTY:

- RESPONSE B ADMITS POTENTIAL UNCERTAINTY AND SUGGESTS CONTACTING SUPPORT
(CLEAR ADVANTAGE TO B)

5. COMPLETENESS:
