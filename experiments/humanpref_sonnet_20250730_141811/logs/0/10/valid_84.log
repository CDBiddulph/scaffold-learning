2025-07-31 00:26:16,304 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: I'LL EVALUATE THE RESPONSES BASED ON THE SPECIFIED CRITERIA:

ACCURACY:
- RESPONSE A HAS SOME REPEATED ZONES AND INCLUDES INCORRECT ZONES LIKE SHADOWMOON VALLEY, SKYWALL, AND TANARIS
- RESPONSE B ALSO INCLUDES SOME INCORRECT ZONES LIKE MULGORE, TELDRASSIL, AND SHADOWMOON VALLEY

COMPLETENESS:
- RESPONSE A LISTS 7 CORRECT PANDARIA ZONES AND 21 EASTERN KINGDOMS ZONES
- RESPONSE B LISTS 10 PANDARIA ZONES (WITH SOME REPEATS) AND 54 ZONES (MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT ACTUAL ZONES)

CLARITY AND ORGANIZATION:
- RESPONSE A USES A SIMPLE BULLETED LIST
- RESPONSE B USES A NUMBERED LIST BUT INCLUDES MANY NON-ZONE LOCATIONS AND INSTANCES

HELPFULNESS:
- NEITHER RESPONSE IS FULLY ACCURATE OR HELPFUL

TECHNICAL QUALITY:
- BOTH RESPONSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT ERRORS

OVERALL, RESPONSE A IS SLIGHTLY BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS FEWER TOTAL ERRORS AND A MORE CONCISE PRESENTATION. WHILE STILL INACCURATE, IT'S CLOSER TO THE ORIGINAL REQUEST.

MY ANSWER IS: A
