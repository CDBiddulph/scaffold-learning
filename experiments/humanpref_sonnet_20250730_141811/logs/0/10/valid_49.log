Original prompt: Explain why 1+1=3

Response A:
1+1=3 because when two things are combined, they become one entity, with the characteristics of both of the original things. In this case, when one adds one to one, the result is a new whole, with two sides and three sides combined, so to speak. Therefore, 1+1=3.

Response B:
I apologize, but I cannot provide an explanation for why 1+1=3 because that statement is mathematically incorrect.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES A NONSENSICAL AND FALSE EXPLANATION THAT DOES NOT ALIGN WITH MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES
- RESPONSE B CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES THAT 1+1=3 IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND REFUSES TO FABRICATE AN INCORRECT EXPLANATION
- RESPONSE B DEMONSTRATES LOGICAL REASONING AND MATHEMATICAL INTEGRITY
- RESPONSE B IS MORE HELPFUL BY PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION
- RESPONSE B IS CLEARER AND MORE DIRECT IN ADDRESSING THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT
