=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,

2025-07-31 00:15:33,875 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: LET ME EVALUATE THE RESPONSES CAREFULLY:

RESPONSE A:
- CALCULATED (10+5)/3 AS 5 ✓ 
- CALCULATED (10+3)/2 AS 6.5 ✓
- CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED "B" AS THE GREATER EQUATION ✓
- USED THE REQUESTED JSON FORMAT ✓
- CLEAN AND PRECISE OUTPUT

RESPONSE B:
- SHOWS FULL EQUATIONS IN THE JSON ✓
- BUT INCORRECTLY SAYS "A" IS GREATER (ACTUALLY WRONG)
- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT JSON FIELD NAMING
- LESS CLEAR/ACCURATE CALCULATION

BASED ON ACCURACY, CLARITY, AND ADHERENCE TO THE PROMPT, RESPONSE A IS SUPERIOR.
