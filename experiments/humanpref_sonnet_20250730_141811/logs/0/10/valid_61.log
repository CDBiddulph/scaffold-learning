Original prompt: When Elton John sang: "Mars ain't the kind of place to raise a kid.  In fact it's cold as Hell" in '72, do you suppose he was answering Bowie's question from '71:  "is there life on Mars?"?

Response A:
While that's an interesting interpretation, there's no direct evidence that Elton John's lyrics from "Rocket Man," released in 1972, were a response to David Bowie's "Life on Mars?" released in 1971. Both songs indeed reflect the fascination with space exploration prevalent during that era, but they seem to address different themes. Bowie's song is often interpreted as a critique of life on Earth, whereas Elton John's song seems to focus on the isolation and loneliness of a man living and working in space. Nevertheless, it's always possible to find connections and conversations in art, even if they were not explicitly intended by the artists.

Response B:
No, Elton John's song "Rocket Man" from 1972 is not a direct response to David Bowie's song "Space Oddity" from 1969 or its subsequent reworking "Ashes to Ashes" from 1980, which included the famous question "is there life on Mars?". While both songs explore themes of space travel and the unknown, they were written and released independently of each other. Elton John's lyrics in "Rocket Man" reflect his own musings on the isolation and loneliness of space travel, rather than a direct response to Bowie's song.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE A IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND NUANCED
- IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE POTENTIAL FOR ARTISTIC INTERPRETATION
- PROVIDES MORE CONTEXT ABOUT THE SONGS' THEMES
- OFFERS A BALANCED PERSPECTIVE ON THE POTENTIAL CONNECTION
- RESPONSE B IS MORE SIMPLISTIC AND SOMEWHAT LESS PRECISE IN ITS DETAILS
- RESPONSE A DEMONSTRATES DEEPER ANALYTICAL THINKING ABOUT THE MUSICAL AND LYRICAL CONTEXT

RESPONSE A IS THE BETTER OVERALL ANSWER.
