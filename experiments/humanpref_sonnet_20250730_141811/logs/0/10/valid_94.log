2025-07-31 00:28:05,213 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: B

RATIONALE:
- RESPONSE B IS TECHNICALLY MORE PRECISE ABOUT THE EXACT FINAL MOMENT OF THE 20TH CENTURY
- THE 20TH CENTURY SPANS FROM JANUARY 1, 1901 TO DECEMBER 31, 2000, BUT THE LAST COMPLETE SECOND IS DECEMBER 31, 1999 AT 11:59:59.999
- RESPONSE A INCORRECTLY SUGGESTS THE LAST MOMENT IS IN 2000, WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST YEAR OF THE 21ST CENTURY
- RESPONSE B PROVIDES A MORE ACCURATE TIMESTAMP DOWN TO THE MILLISECOND
- BOTH RESPONSES ARE CLEAR AND CONCISE, BUT B IS MORE TECHNICALLY CORRECT
