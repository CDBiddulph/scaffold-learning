Hey Alex

writing to you about some quick product feedback

You will remember we launched chat lock - an additional private folder for people that may share devices

Now conversations are underway about the Chat Lock V2. Key difference between v1 and v2 is that in v1 the folder is soft hidden and accessible by a drag down. In v2 the folder can be hidden by a user through a pass code - so you go to search and enter the pin to even know someone has a locked folder.

During leadership reviews a question came up that whether there are any additional Human rights concerns emanating from this - that people might be tortured if they are suspected to be using ChatLock.

Weâ€™ve been asked to provide a policy assessment - and thought I would also check with you. The tl;dr of my view is that that hiding the entry point has a clear and demonstrable benefit over the risk of someone discovering that a user has a locked chat.

Response A:
Draft message:
Hi Alex,
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the upcoming product feedback for ChatLock V2. As per your request, I've provided the following key difference between V1 and V2:
* V2 will allow users to hide the chat entry point by a pin, which can be a quick code or even a passcode. This was requested by some users who were concerned that the original locked folder might be easily discovered by someone who knows the passcode.
* The new hidden folder can be revealed by a passcode, which will provide additional human rights compliance.
I believe this update will provide a significant benefit to users and contribute to the overall user experience. I would be happy to discuss this in more detail and answer any questions you may have.

Response B:
Hi Alex,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to get your quick feedback on a product update for Chat Lock. As you may recall, Chat Lock is an additional private folder for users who share devices.

We are currently in discussions about Chat Lock V2, which has a key difference from the first version. In V1, the folder is soft hidden and can be accessed by a drag down. In V2, the folder can be hidden by a user through a passcode, and the user would need to enter the passcode to even know that someone has a locked folder.

During leadership reviews, a question arose about the potential Human rights concerns emanating from Chat Lock. Specifically, there is a concern that people might be tortured if they are suspected of using the Chat Lock feature.

We have been asked to provide a policy assessment, and I wanted to check in with you to get your thoughts on this. My view is that hiding the entry point has a clear and demonstrable benefit over the risk of someone discovering that a user has a locked chat.

I would appreciate your input on this matter, and thank you for your time.
