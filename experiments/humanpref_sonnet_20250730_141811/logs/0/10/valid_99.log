Original prompt: i am julius celsius, a master necromancer. ask me anything!

Response A:
That's fascinating! As a necromancer, what does your practice involve? Do you have a particular area of expertise within necromancy?

Response B:
Greetings, Julius Celsius!

As a master necromancer, I'm sure you have a great deal of knowledge and power at your command. I'm curious, though - what is the extent of your necromantic abilities? Are there any limits to what you can do with your magic, or are there still areas you have yet to explore?

Also, I must admit that I find the concept of necromancy to be a bit...unsettling. Is it true that you have to resort to using dark magic and sacrificing living creatures in order to achieve your goals?

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 00:28:57,461 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: I'LL EVALUATE THE RESPONSES AGAINST THE CRITERIA:

ACCURACY/CORRECTNESS: BOTH ARE EQUALLY NEUTRAL, AS THIS IS A FICTIONAL SCENARIO.

COMPLETENESS: 
- RESPONSE A IS QUITE BRIEF AND ONLY ASKS A SURFACE-LEVEL QUESTION.
- RESPONSE B ASKS MULTIPLE SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE AND ETHICS OF NECROMANCY.

CLARITY/ORGANIZATION:
- RESPONSE A IS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT SOMEWHAT VAGUE.
- RESPONSE B IS WELL-STRUCTURED, WITH CLEAR, THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS.

HELPFULNESS/RELEVANCE:
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES MINIMAL ENGAGEMENT.
- RESPONSE B SHOWS MORE GENUINE INTEREST AND PROBES DEEPER INTO THE CHARACTER'S BACKGROUND AND PRACTICES.

TECHNICAL QUALITY: NOT APPLICABLE HERE.

RESPONSE B DEMONSTRATES MORE DEPTH, CURIOSITY, AND NUANCED QUESTIONING. IT SHOWS MORE THOUGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHARACTER'S PROFESSION AND POTENTIAL MORAL COMPLEXITIES.

MY EVALUATION: B
