REASONING:
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES A MORE COMPLETE AND CLEAR EXPLANATION
- RESPONSE A OFFERS ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND CLARIFICATION BEYOND JUST STATING WHAT "IT" REFERS TO
- RESPONSE A EXPLAINS THE MEANING OF THE SENTENCE AND WHY THE APPLE DOESN'T FIT
- RESPONSE B, WHILE TECHNICALLY CORRECT, IS VERY BRIEF AND LACKS THE DEPTH AND HELPFULNESS OF RESPONSE A
