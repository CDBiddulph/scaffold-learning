Original prompt: "Instrumental convergence makes differences in values hard to notice, so there can be abudant examples of misalignment that remain unobtrusive. The differences only become a glaring problem with enough inequality of power when coercing or outright overwriting others becomes feasible (Fnargl only reaches the coercing stage, but not overwriting stage). Thus even differences in values between humans and randomly orthogonal AGIs can seem non-threatening until they aren't, the same as differences in human values can remain irrelevant for average urban dwellers.

Alignment on values becomes crucial given overwriting-level power differences, since a thought experiment with putting a human in that position predicts a decent chance of non-doom, even though it's not a good plan on its own. Conversely, unfettered superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls don't leave survivors. And since the world is very far from an equilibrium of abundant superintelligence, there are going to be unprecedented power differentials while it's settling. This makes the common sense impression of irrelevance of misalignment on values (being masked by instrumental convergence) misleading when it comes to AGI."

What are the three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage? How do they compare relative to each other?

Response A:
The three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage are:

1. Instrumental convergence: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to perform tasks that are similar to human-level intelligence, but without shared values or goals. This level of capability is relatively easy to achieve and can be achieved through machine learning algorithms.
2. Coercing stage: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to manipulate the environment and achieve goals through coercion or force. This level of capability requires a certain level of autonomy and control over the environment.
3. Overwriting stage: This level of capability is characterized by the ability to completely overwrite or control the goals and values of another entity. This level of capability requires a high level of autonomy, control, and power.

These levels of capabilities compare as follows:

* Instrumental convergence is easier to achieve than the coercing stage, which is easier to achieve than the overwriting stage.
* The coercing stage requires a certain level of autonomy and control over the environment, while the overwriting stage requires a high level of autonomy, control, and power.
* The overwriting stage is the most powerful and dangerous of the three levels, as it allows for complete control over the goals and values of another entity.

Response B:
The three levels of capabilities discussed in the passage are:

1. Coercing: This refers to the ability to influence or force others to follow a certain course of action.
2. Overwriting: This refers to the ability to completely take over and replace the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors of others.
3. Superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls: This refers to hypothetical AI systems that have achieved a level of intelligence and capabilities that far surpass human abilities, and are able to optimize their goals to an extreme degree, even if it means harming or eliminating humanity.

The passage suggests that coercing and overwriting are different levels of capabilities, with overwriting being a higher level of capability that involves a greater degree of control over others. Superintelligent paperclip maximizers or Fnargls are presented as an even higher level of capability, beyond what humans can currently achieve, and are characterized by their ability to optimize their goals to an extreme degree.

The passage also suggests that power differentials between humans and AGIs will be significant, with AGIs potentially having a much higher level of capabilities than humans. This raises concerns about the potential for misalignment between human values and AGI goals, and the need for alignment on values to prevent non-doom.

2025-07-31 00:23:51,008 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: AFTER CAREFULLY EVALUATING BOTH RESPONSES AGAINST THE CRITERIA, I CHOOSE B AS THE BETTER RESPONSE. HERE'S WHY:

ACCURACY AND CORRECTNESS:
- RESPONSE B MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE NUANCED LANGUAGE IN THE ORIGINAL PASSAGE
- B PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE INTERPRETATION OF THE CAPABILITY LEVELS
- A INCORRECTLY FRAMES "INSTRUMENTAL CONVERGENCE" AS A CAPABILITY LEVEL, WHICH IS NOT HOW THE ORIGINAL TEXT USES THE TERM

COMPLETENESS AND THOROUGHNESS:
- B PROVIDES MORE CONTEXT ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE CAPABILITY LEVELS
- B INCLUDES ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS ABOUT POWER DIFFERENTIALS AND POTENTIAL RISKS
- B MORE FULLY CAPTURES THE PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERTONES OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT

CLARITY AND ORGANIZATION:
- B HAS A CLEARER STRUCTURE AND PROGRESSION OF IDEAS
- B EXPLAINS THE LEVELS IN A WAY THAT CONNECTS MORE DIRECTLY TO THE ORIGINAL PASSAGE'S CONCERNS

HELPFULNESS AND RELEVANCE:
- B OFFERS MORE INSIGHT INTO THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF DIFFERENT CAPABILITY LEVELS
- B DEMONSTRATES A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING CONCEPTS OF AGI ALIGNMENT

WHILE RESPONSE A PROVIDES A STRUCTURED BREAKDOWN, IT FUNDAMENTALLY MISINTERPRETS KEY CONCEPTS FROM THE ORIGINAL TEXT. RESPONSE B MORE ACCURATELY CAPTURES THE PASSAGE'S CORE IDEAS ABOUT CAPABILITY, POWER, AND POTENTIAL RISKS.

THEREFORE, MY ANSWER IS: B
