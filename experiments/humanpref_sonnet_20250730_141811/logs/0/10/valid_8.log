Original prompt: Can you explain this joke: "What’s the best thing about Switzerland? I don’t know, but the flag is a big plus."?

Response A:
This is a play on words, with the pun "big plus" meaning a large advantage or benefit, but also referring to the shape of the flag of Switzerland, which features a white cross on a red background, with the longer arms of the cross being longer than the shorter arms, creating a shape that resembles a plus sign.

Response B:
This joke plays on the idea that the Swiss flag is red with a white cross on it, which is very distinctive and easy to recognize. The joke suggests that the Swiss flag is the best thing about Switzerland, even though the speaker doesn't know why. This is a kind of absurd or exaggerated statement that is often used in jokes to make a point or to get a laugh.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
