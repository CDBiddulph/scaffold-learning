Original prompt: What does the word "peretomen" mean in Attic Greek?

Response A:
In Attic Greek, "peretomen" is the second person plural form of the verb "peritithemi," which means "to place around," "to put on," or "to apply." It can also mean "to expose" or "to exhibit."

Response B:
I'm an expert in many fields, but I don't have access to specific databases or the ability to perform real-time research. However, based on my extensive knowledge, I can tell you that "peretomen" does not appear to be a valid word in Attic Greek. It might be a typo, a word from a different dialect or language, or a term specific to a certain field or text. If you have more context or information, I might be able to help you better.

To verify this information, I recommend consulting a Greek language dictionary, a lexicon of Attic Greek, or a scholar familiar with the language.

Here are some reliable resources for looking up Ancient Greek words:

1. Perseus Digital Library: This online library offers a searchable Greek lexicon, including Liddell & Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, which is a comprehensive resource for classical Greek.

2. Logeion: A free and open-source dictionary application that aggregates information from various Greek and Latin dictionaries.

Website: https://logeion.uchicago.edu/

3. A Greek-English Lexicon, by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott: Commonly known as Liddell & Scott, this is a widely-used lexicon of classical Greek. It is available in print and online through the Perseus Digital Library.

If you're still unsure about the meaning of "peretomen" after consulting these resources, I recommend reaching out to a scholar or expert in Ancient Greek language or literature for further assistance.
