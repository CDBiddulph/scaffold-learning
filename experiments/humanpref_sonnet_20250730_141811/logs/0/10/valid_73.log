2025-07-31 00:24:14,565 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: LET ME EVALUATE THE RESPONSES SYSTEMATICALLY:

ACCURACY:
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES VERY DETAILED STEPS, BUT SEEMS FABRICATED AND NOT NECESSARILY ACCURATE TO OMNIVORE'S ACTUAL NEWSLETTER PROCESS
- RESPONSE B IS MORE GENERIC BUT SOUNDS MORE PLAUSIBLE

COMPLETENESS:
- RESPONSE A IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE, WITH ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT EMAIL WORKFLOWS
- RESPONSE B IS MORE BASIC AND STRAIGHTFORWARD

CLARITY:
- BOTH RESPONSES ARE CLEARLY WRITTEN AND ORGANIZED IN NUMBERED STEPS
- RESPONSE A HAS SLIGHTLY MORE STRUCTURED EXPLANATIONS

HELPFULNESS:
- RESPONSE B ACKNOWLEDGES POTENTIAL NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE
- RESPONSE A PROVIDES SPECIFIC BUT POTENTIALLY INCORRECT TECHNICAL DETAILS

TECHNICAL QUALITY:
- RESPONSE A APPEARS MORE TECHNICALLY DETAILED BUT POTENTIALLY INACCURATE
- RESPONSE B IS MORE GENERICALLY ACCURATE

RECOMMENDATION RATIONALE:
WHILE RESPONSE A SEEMS MORE ELABORATE, RESPONSE B APPEARS MORE LIKELY TO BE GENUINELY HELPFUL AND ACCURATE. IT PROVIDES A REALISTIC APPROACH AND SUGGESTS CONTACTING SUPPORT FOR PRECISE DETAILS.

THEREFORE, MY EVALUATION CONCLUDES WITH: B
