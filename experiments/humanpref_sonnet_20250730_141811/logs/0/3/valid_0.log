Answer: A

2025-07-30 22:20:33,477 [INFO] Backup evaluation result: B

Reason: Response B is more concise, direct, and focuses on a clear benefit (getting paid faster). The language is simpler and more punchy, which works better for a billboard where viewers have limited time to read and understand the message. It eliminates unnecessary words like "cutting-edge" and "business operations" while maintaining a strong value proposition.
