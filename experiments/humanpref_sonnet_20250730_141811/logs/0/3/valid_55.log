Original prompt: if i put a fresh fruit next to another "almost rotten" fruit, will it affect the fresh fruit ?

Response A:
Yes, it will. Fruits produce a gas called ethylene as they ripen, and this gas can accelerate the ripening process of other fruits nearby. So if a fresh fruit is placed next to an almost rotten one, the fresh fruit may ripen and spoil more quickly. This is why it's generally a good idea to separate overripe fruits from those that are not yet ripe.

Response B:
Yes, placing a fresh fruit next to an "almost rotten" fruit can indeed affect the fresh fruit. This is mainly due to the process of ethylene production and the spread of microbial organisms like bacteria and fungi.

Ethylene is a plant hormone that is produced in the form of a gas by many fruits, and it triggers the ripening process. Ripe or rotting fruits often produce larger amounts of ethylene, which can accelerate the ripening and potentially the decay of nearby fresh fruits. This is why the saying "one bad apple can spoil the whole bunch" holds true.

Moreover, the almost rotten fruit may have a higher load of bacteria, fungi, or mold, which can spread to the fresh fruit, especially if they are in direct contact. This could lead to the fresh fruit becoming contaminated and spoiling more quickly.

To avoid this, it's a good practice to separate overripe or rotting fruits from fresh ones and to store fruits appropriately, often in a cool, ventilated space, and not necessarily all together in a single bowl or drawer unless you want them to ripen more quickly. Refrigerating certain fruits can slow down the production of ethylene and the growth of microbes, therefore extending their shelf life.
