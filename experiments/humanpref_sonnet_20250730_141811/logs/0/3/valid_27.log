2. Help in finding information, products or services, and providing suggestions.

3. Assist in organizing your day by creating a to-do list, setting reminders, or finding local services.

4. Offer writing assistance by generating text, editing documents, or helping with composing emails and letters.

5. Perform simple mathematical calculations and unit conversions.

6. Help with language translation between multiple supported languages.

7. Provide entertainment by telling stories, jokes, or revealing trivia.

9. Guide you through troubleshooting technical issues or finding solutions to common problems.

10. Enhance your learning and education by providing study materials, summarizing articles, or helping with homework.

Keep in mind that I can perform these tasks as long as they are legal and ethical. I do not have the capability to manipulate physical objects, access personal information without explicit user consent, or perform actions that may harm others. My primary goal is to provide helpful and reliable information and services to make your life easier and more productive.
