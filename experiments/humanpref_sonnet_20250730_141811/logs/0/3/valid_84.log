2025-07-30 22:36:38,410 [INFO] Primary evaluation result: After carefully evaluating both responses, I choose:

A

Reasoning:
- Response A is more accurate, listing the actual zones in Pandaria and Eastern Kingdoms
- Response B includes many incorrect or non-existent zones
- Response A provides a clean, concise list without unnecessary repetition
- Response B appears to mix zones from different games/expansions and includes instances like raid/dungeon locations that are not actual zones
- Response A directly answers the user's request in a straightforward manner
- Response B's list is bloated and contains many errors, which would confuse the user

While Response A is not perfect (it has a minor duplicate of Kun-Lai Summit and includes some non-Pandaria zones), it is significantly more accurate and useful than Response B.
