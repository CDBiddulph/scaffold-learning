2025-07-30 22:39:31,719 [INFO] Primary evaluation result: Let me carefully evaluate these responses:

Response A (December 31, 2000, at 23:59:59):
- Technically incorrect (common misconception)
- Precise time format
- Confidently stated

Response B (December 31, 1999 11:59:59.999 PM):
- Historically and mathematically correct
- Precise time format including milliseconds
- Clear and unambiguous

The 20th century ran from January 1, 1901, to December 31, 2000. However, the last moment of the 20th century is December 31, 1999, at 23:59:59.999, not December 31, 2000. This is because there was no year zero, so the first century ran from year 1 to year 100, the second from 101 to 200, and so on.

Response B is more accurate, complete, and provides the precise technical detail. It directly and correctly answers the specific question.

My evaluation concludes with the response: B

2025-07-30 22:39:34,109 [INFO] Backup evaluation result: B

Explanation: Response B is more precise and technically correct. While there's a common misconception that the 20th century ended on December 31, 2000, it actually ended on December 31, 1999, at 23:59:59.999. This is because the 20th century spans from January 1, 1901, to December 31, 2000. Response A incorrectly states that the last second of the 20th century was on December 31, 2000.
