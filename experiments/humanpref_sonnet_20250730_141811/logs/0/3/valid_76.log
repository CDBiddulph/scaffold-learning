Original prompt: How many seacontainers are reported Losst every year?

Response A:
According to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 1,382 containers were lost at sea on average each year between 2008 and 2019. However, it's important to note that not all lost containers are reported, and the actual number may be higher. Additionally, some years may have more or fewer losses due to various factors, including weather conditions and shipping accidents.

Response B:
It is difficult to provide an exact number of seacontainers lost at sea each year, as the exact number can vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, shipping routes, and the quality of container ships. However, according to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 containers are lost at sea each year due to accidents, mishandling, and harsh weather conditions. It's important to note that this number is just an estimate and may not reflect the exact number of containers lost every year.

2025-07-30 22:35:05,420 [INFO] Primary evaluation result: I'll carefully evaluate both responses based on the specified criteria:

Accuracy and factual correctness:
- Response A provides a more precise figure (1,382) from a specific time period
- Response B gives a broader range (5,000 to 10,000) which seems less precise

Helpfulness and usefulness:
- Both responses provide context about container loss
- A is more specific and data-driven
- B acknowledges uncertainty but with less precision

Completeness:
- Both offer explanations beyond the raw number
- A provides a specific time frame
- B gives more context about potential causes

Clarity and readability:
- Both are clear and easily understood
- A is slightly more concise

Following instructions:
- Both directly address the question
- A seems more aligned with the specific request

Quality of explanation:
- A provides a more authoritative and precise explanation
- B uses more general language

Overall user satisfaction:
- A is likely to give the user more confidence in the information

Answer: A

=== STDERR ===
2025-07-30 22:35:09,236 [INFO] Backup evaluation result: I recommend Response A as the better response.

Reasons:
1. Response A provides a more precise statistic (1,382 containers) from a credible source (World Shipping Council)
2. The language is more measured and specific
3. It acknowledges potential limitations in reporting
4. It provides a specific time period (2008-2019)

Response B:
1. Has a much wider and less precise range (5,000 to 10,000)
2. Sounds more generalized
3. Uses less specific language
4. Does not cite a specific source or time period as clearly

Response A presents the information more professionally and credibly.
