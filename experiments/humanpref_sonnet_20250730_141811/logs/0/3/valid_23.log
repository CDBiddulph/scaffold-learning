=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-30 22:25:10,834 [INFO] Primary evaluation result: Let's evaluate both responses:

Response A:
- Calculates (10+5)/3 as 5 ✓ (correct)
- Calculates (10+3)/2 as 6.5 ✓ (correct)
- Correctly identifies the second equation (B) as greater ✓ 
- Uses the specified JSON format ✓
- Clear and straightforward ✓

Response B:
- Keeps original equation format instead of calculated values ✗ (less clear)
- Incorrectly claims the first equation is greater ✗ (wrong answer)
- Does not fully resolve the equations ✗
- Slightly deviates from the exact JSON structure requested ✗

Response A is superior. It provides:
- Accurate calculations
- Correct comparison
- Clear JSON output
- Directly addresses the user's request

The answer is: A

2025-07-30 22:25:18,399 [INFO] Backup evaluation result: Let's compare the responses:

Response A:
- Correctly calculates (10+5)/3 as 5
- Correctly calculates (10+3)/2 as 6.5
- Correctly identifies that equation 2 is greater with "B"
- Uses "greaterEquation" as the key for the comparison result

Response B:
- Uses the actual calculation expression as values for "equation1" and "equation2"
- Incorrectly identifies the greater equation as "A" when it should be "B"
- Uses "greater" as the key for the comparison result

Based on accuracy and clarity, Response A is better.

The answer is: A
