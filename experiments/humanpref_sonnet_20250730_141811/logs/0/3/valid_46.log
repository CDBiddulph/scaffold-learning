2025-07-30 22:29:21,177 [INFO] Primary evaluation result: Let me carefully evaluate both responses across the key criteria:

Accuracy:
- Response A makes an assumption about Daniel going to the kitchen, which is not stated in the original text
- Response B correctly notes that the text does not specify Daniel's precise location

Helpfulness:
- Response A provides a simple, direct answer
- Response B provides a more precise analysis of the information available

Completeness:
- Response A fills in gaps with reasonable inferences
- Response B strictly adheres to the information provided

Clarity:
- Both responses are clear and straightforward

Following instructions:
- Response B is more precise in not adding unsupported details
- Response A assumes information not in the original text

Reasoning quality:
- Response B shows more careful reasoning by acknowledging the limitations of the given information
- Response A makes logical but unsupported inferences

Overall, Response B provides a more accurate, careful, and responsible interpretation of the text. It avoids making unwarranted assumptions and clearly explains what is and is not known from the original information.

My response is: B

My response is: B. Trying backup evaluation.
2025-07-30 22:29:24,835 [INFO] Backup evaluation result: A

Reasoning:
Response A directly answers both questions posed in the prompt:
1. Where does Daniel go? - To the kitchen (because he is also hungry)
2. Why did John go to the kitchen? - To get something to eat because he was hungry

Response A provides clear, logical answers based on the information in the original scenario. It uses context and inference to explain Daniel's likely actions and John's motivation, which makes it a more helpful and complete response.

Response B, while technically correct that the details are not explicitly stated, fails to provide a helpful interpretation and does not fully address the questions asked.
