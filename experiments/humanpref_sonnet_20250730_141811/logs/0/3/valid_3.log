Response B:
Here are the answers to the true or false statements:

1. True. Simon Bolivar was known as "The Libertator" and was a key figure in the Latin American independence movements.
2. False. San Martin was a key figure in the independence of Argentina, Chile, and Peru, but he was not the main figure during the independence wars in Mexico. That role belonged to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Jose Maria Morelos, and Augustin de Iturbide.
3. True. Mining was an important economic source in Peru, particularly in the Andean region, where the Spanish established mines to extract silver, gold, and other minerals.
4. False. Cortés was a key conquistador in Mexico, but he was not the most important one in Peru. That role belonged to Francisco Pizarro, who led the expedition that conquered the Inca Empire.
5. False. El Dorado is a mythical place, not a real one, and it is associated with the legend of a city made of gold that was believed to exist in South America during the time of the Spanish conquest.
6. False. The Inquisition did affect the American colonies, particularly in Mexico and Peru, where the Spanish established tribunals to persecute and punish those accused of heresy, blasphemy, and other offenses against the Catholic Church.
7. True. Sor Juana was an important painter from Mexico, known for her works that depicted religious scenes and mythological figures.
8. False. The Mexicas did not build Tenochtitlan. The city was built by the Aztecs, who established their capital there in the 14th century.
9. True. The creoles had control of many administrative offices during the colonial period, particularly in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, where they held positions of power and wealth.
10. False. Indigenous cities like Tenochtitlan and Cuzco were not preserved exactly how they were by the Spaniards. The Spanish conquistadors and colonizers often built their own cities and buildings over the top of existing indigenous settlements, and many indigenous cities were abandoned or destroyed as a result of the conquest.
11. False. The use of the plaza of the new cities to have celebrations was not totally prohibited. While the Spanish established rules and regulations governing the use of public spaces, they did not completely prohibit celebrations and other gatherings in the plazas.
12. True. The barrios were home to the majority of the poor. In many Spanish American cities, the barrios were the poorest and most marginalized neighborhoods, often inhabited by indigenous people, Afro-Latin Americans, and other marginalized groups.
13. False. In Brazilian urban areas, the slaves did not live in barracks. While slavery was legal in Brazil until the late 19th century, slaves were not typically housed in barracks. Instead, they lived in small houses or shacks, often located in the backyards of their owners' homes.
