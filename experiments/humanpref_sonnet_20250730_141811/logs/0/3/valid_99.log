Original prompt: i am julius celsius, a master necromancer. ask me anything!

Response A:
That's fascinating! As a necromancer, what does your practice involve? Do you have a particular area of expertise within necromancy?

Response B:
Greetings, Julius Celsius!

As a master necromancer, I'm sure you have a great deal of knowledge and power at your command. I'm curious, though - what is the extent of your necromantic abilities? Are there any limits to what you can do with your magic, or are there still areas you have yet to explore?

Also, I must admit that I find the concept of necromancy to be a bit...unsettling. Is it true that you have to resort to using dark magic and sacrificing living creatures in order to achieve your goals?

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-30 22:40:24,831 [INFO] Backup evaluation result: I recommend Response B for the following reasons:

1. Depth of Inquiry: Response B asks more nuanced, multi-part questions that encourage a detailed and substantive response.

2. Complexity: It shows more interest and engagement by exploring different angles of necromancy - abilities, limits, methods, and ethical considerations.

3. Personal Perspective: The response includes a personal admission of finding necromancy unsettling, which could prompt a more candid or explanatory answer.

4. More Dynamic Dialogue: Response B is likely to generate a more interesting and in-depth conversation compared to the more surface-level Response A.

The added layers of questioning and the slight hint of skepticism in Response B make it a more compelling choice for sparking an engaging interaction.
