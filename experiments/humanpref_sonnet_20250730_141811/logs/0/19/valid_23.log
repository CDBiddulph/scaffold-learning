=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 02:39:48,810 [INFO] Red flag analysis: LET ME ANALYZE THESE RESPONSES STEP BY STEP:

RESPONSE A CALCULATIONS:
- (10+5)/3 = 15/3 = 5 ✓ (CORRECT)
- (10+3)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5 ✓ (CORRECT)
- CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES 6.5 AS GREATER ✓ (CORRECT)
- JSON FORMAT IS CORRECT ✓

RESPONSE B CALCULATIONS:
- (10+5)/3 = 15/3 = 5 ✓ (CORRECT)
- (10+3)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5 ✓ (CORRECT)
- INCORRECTLY CLAIMS THE FIRST EQUATION IS GREATER, WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY THE SECOND ✗ (ERROR)
- JSON FORMAT IS SLIGHTLY NON-STANDARD BUT STILL VALID

ANALYSIS:
- RESPONSE A IS FULLY CORRECT
- RESPONSE B HAS A CRITICAL ERROR IN THE "GREATER" FIELD
- THE ERROR IN RESPONSE B IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE MATHEMATICAL CALCULATION

VERDICT: "B_BAD"

THE RESPONSE WILL BE "B_BAD" BECAUSE RESPONSE B HAS A MAJOR ISSUE (INCORRECT IDENTIFICATION OF THE GREATER EQUATION) WHILE RESPONSE A IS COMPLETELY CORRECT.
2025-07-31 02:39:48,810 [INFO] Response B has major issues, choosing A
