7. The best type of brace for Emese would be a hinged knee brace with patellar support. This type of brace provides stability and support to the knee joint, while also reducing pressure on the patellar tendon.
8. Here are some hinged knee braces with patellar support that could be suitable for Emese:
* DonJoy Deluxe Hinged Knee Brace: This brace provides adjustable compression and patellar tracking, as well as medial and lateral hinges for added stability.
* Bauerfeind GenuTrain S Pro: This brace features a patella buttress that helps to stabilize the kneecap and reduce pain. It also has a massage effect that can help to improve circulation and reduce swelling.
* McDavid Patellar Knee Strap: While this is not a hinged brace, it is a patellar strap that can provide targeted support to the patellar tendon. It is adjustable and can be worn during activities.
9. The DonJoy Deluxe Hinged Knee Brace is recommended as it provides adjustable compression, patellar tracking, and medial and lateral hinges for added stability. It is also adjustable and can be customized to fit Emese's knee. Here is a link to the product: <https://www.donjoy.com/products/knee/knee-braces/deluxe-hinged-knee-brace>
