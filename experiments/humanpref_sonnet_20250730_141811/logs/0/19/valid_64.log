Original prompt: Tell me in 5 sentences what Harry Potter series is about, then cite what popular movie critics say about the series.

Response A:
The Harry Potter series, authored by J.K. Rowling, is a seven-book saga that follows the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who aims to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body, and destroy anyone who stands in his way, especially Harry. Each book represents a year in Harry's life, filled with magic, adventure, and personal growth. The series also explores themes of friendship, ambition, prejudice, and the moral significance of death.

The series has been highly praised by critics. The Guardian lauds it for its "richly imagined world and compelling, complex characters." The New York Times praises Rowling's skillful storytelling, stating, "Harry Potter is more than a fantasy series; it's a master class in storytelling." Roger Ebert described the movies as a "spellbinding saga," while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called them "pure magic". Rotten Tomatoes gives the series an overall rating of 84%, indicating universal acclaim.

Response B:
The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is a seven-book saga that follows the life and adventures of a young wizard named Harry Potter, who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is famous in the wizarding world for surviving an attack by the dark wizard Voldemort as an infant. Alongside his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Harry attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns about magic, and faces various challenges including school exams, teenage angst, and the resurgence of Voldemort. Throughout the series, themes of friendship, courage, and the struggle between good and evil are explored as Harry and his friends work to thwart Voldemort's plans to conquer the wizarding and non-magical worlds. The series culminates in an epic battle between the forces of darkness and the defenders of the wizarding community, with the fate of both worlds hanging in the balance. Harry's journey is not just a fight for survival, but also a quest for identity, as he seeks to understand his past and shape his destiny.

Regarding critical reception, the Harry Potter series has been widely praised by popular movie critics. The series has been lauded for its imagination, character development, and the depth of its fantasy world. Roger Ebert, the late film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the first film, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," four out of four stars, describing it as a "classic." A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2" for delivering "a graceful and satisfying finale" to the film series. Overall, critics have commended the film adaptations for their fidelity to the books and their ability to appeal to both children and adults.
