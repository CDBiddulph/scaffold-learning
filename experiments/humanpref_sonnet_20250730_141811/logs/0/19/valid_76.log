Original prompt: How many seacontainers are reported Losst every year?

Response A:
According to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 1,382 containers were lost at sea on average each year between 2008 and 2019. However, it's important to note that not all lost containers are reported, and the actual number may be higher. Additionally, some years may have more or fewer losses due to various factors, including weather conditions and shipping accidents.

Response B:
It is difficult to provide an exact number of seacontainers lost at sea each year, as the exact number can vary depending on factors such as weather conditions, shipping routes, and the quality of container ships. However, according to the World Shipping Council, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 containers are lost at sea each year due to accidents, mishandling, and harsh weather conditions. It's important to note that this number is just an estimate and may not reflect the exact number of containers lost every year.

2025-07-31 02:48:40,039 [INFO] Red flag analysis: LET'S ANALYZE THE RESPONSES CAREFULLY:

RESPONSE A:
- CITES A SPECIFIC SOURCE (WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL)
- PROVIDES A PRECISE FIGURE (1,382 CONTAINERS)
- ACKNOWLEDGES POTENTIAL UNDERREPORTING
- SEEMS FACTUAL AND MEASURED

RESPONSE B:
- ALSO MENTIONS WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL
- PROVIDES A MUCH WIDER RANGE (5,000 TO 10,000 CONTAINERS)
- THE RANGE SEEMS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM RESPONSE A
- DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE DISCREPANCY IN NUMBERS

KEY ISSUES WITH RESPONSE B:
- THE NUMERICAL RANGE IS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FROM RESPONSE A WITHOUT EXPLANATION
- THE RANGE IS QUITE BROAD AND LACKS PRECISION
- SEEMS LESS CREDIBLE DUE TO THE WIDE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED RANGE

RESPONSE A APPEARS MORE PRECISE, CREDIBLE, AND WELL-SUPPORTED.

THEREFORE, MY ASSESSMENT IS: "B_BAD"

THE KEY PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY AND SIGNIFICANT NUMERICAL DISCREPANCY IN RESPONSE B, WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY COMPARED TO THE MORE MEASURED RESPONSE A.
