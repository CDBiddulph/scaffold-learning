Original prompt: What the difference between Java Annotations? @Inject and @Autowired.

Response A:
@Inject is used to inject dependencies into classes, while @Autowired is used to inject dependencies into beans managed by Spring.

Response B:
Java annotations are special markers that are used to provide additional information to the Java compiler or runtime environment. The @Inject annotation is used to inject dependencies into a class, while the @Autowired annotation is used to autowire a specific dependency into a class. The difference is that @Inject allows for any dependency to be injected, while @Autowired specifies a particular dependency to be injected.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".
