Original prompt: I want to test my knowledge on math problems. I want you to organize a game in which you generate math equations and ask me to solve them. Once I provide you an answer, you will check my answer and tell me if I'm right or wrong. Each test equation you ask me to solve should be formulated structured as {NUMBER} OPERAND {NUMBER} where NUMBER is in the set {0-100}. When you want me to solve a question, pose it to me as "What is the correct answer to" followed by the equation. Ask me when I am ready to start the game.
