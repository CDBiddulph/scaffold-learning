2025-07-30 22:49:24,334 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: B

RATIONALE:
- BOTH SENTENCES ARE RELEVANT AND ADDRESS BILLING SOFTWARE SALES
- RESPONSE B IS SLIGHTLY MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT
- RESPONSE B USES MORE ACTION-ORIENTED LANGUAGE ("GET PAID FASTER")
- RESPONSE B FEELS MORE LIKE A NATURAL BILLBOARD MESSAGE
- RESPONSE B FOLLOWS THE "SINGLE SENTENCE" REQUIREMENT PRECISELY
- RESPONSE B MAINTAINS CLARITY AND HAS A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION
- RESPONSE B SEEMS MORE LIKELY TO GRAB ATTENTION QUICKLY

WHILE RESPONSE A IS ALSO GOOD, RESPONSE B EDGES IT OUT BY BEING MORE CRISP AND IMMEDIATELY COMPELLING.
