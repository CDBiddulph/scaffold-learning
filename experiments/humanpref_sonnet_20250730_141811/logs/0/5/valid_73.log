2025-07-30 22:56:58,260 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: B

REASONING:
- RESPONSE A APPEARS TO BE FABRICATED AND PROVIDES DETAILED STEPS THAT DO NOT MATCH OMNIVORE'S ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY (OMNIVORE IS A READ-IT-LATER APP FOR SAVING ARTICLES, NOT AN EMAIL MARKETING PLATFORM)
- RESPONSE B IS MORE GENERIC BUT DOESN'T MAKE UP FALSE INFORMATION
- RESPONSE B ACKNOWLEDGES POTENTIAL UNCERTAINTY BY SUGGESTING CONTACTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT
- RESPONSE A COMPLETELY MISREPRESENTS OMNIVORE'S CORE PURPOSE
- RESPONSE B IS MORE HONEST ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS OF DIRECT KNOWLEDGE
- THE CORE ACCURACY ISSUE MAKES RESPONSE A FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED, WHILE RESPONSE B MAINTAINS CREDIBILITY

THE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IS THAT RESPONSE B DOES NOT INVENT A FICTIONAL WORKFLOW, WHICH WOULD MISLEAD THE USER, WHILE RESPONSE A CREATES AN ENTIRELY FICTIONAL PROCESS FOR A SERVICE THAT DOES NOT OPERATE THAT WAY.
