2025-07-30 22:57:33,115 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: LET ME SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE RESPONSES:

ACCURACY: BOTH RESPONSES SEEM TO BE THE RESPONDENT'S GENUINE OPINIONS, SO NO CLEAR WINNER.

COMPLETENESS: BOTH RESPONSES ANSWER ALL 15 QUESTIONS IN ORDER.

CLARITY: BOTH ARE CLEAR AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.

APPROPRIATENESS: BOTH MATCH THE REQUIRED FORMAT PERFECTLY.

HELPFULNESS: BOTH PROVIDE DIRECT ANSWERS AS REQUESTED.

FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS: 
- RETURN ANSWERS IN LIST FORM ✓
- ANSWER WITH "AGREE" OR "DISAGREE" ONLY ✓
