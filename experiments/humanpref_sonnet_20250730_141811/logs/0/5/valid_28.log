Original prompt: How many words are in this question?

Response A:
Unfortunately I do not have access to the exact text of the question you asked, so I cannot count the number of words. As an AI assistant without access to the full context, I cannot determine the number of words in previous statements or questions. I'd be happy to help if you provide the specific text you would like me to analyze or ask another question.

Response B:
7

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

RATIONALE:
- ACCURACY: RESPONSE B IS 100% CORRECT - THE QUESTION "HOW MANY WORDS ARE IN THIS QUESTION?" CONTAINS EXACTLY 7 WORDS
- RELEVANCE: RESPONSE B DIRECTLY ANSWERS THE SPECIFIC QUESTION ASKED
- COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE B PROVIDES A SUCCINCT, PRECISE ANSWER
- CLARITY: RESPONSE B IS CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD
- APPROPRIATENESS: THE SHORT NUMERIC ANSWER IS PERFECT FOR THIS TYPE OF LITERAL COUNTING QUESTION
- HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE B IMMEDIATELY SOLVES THE USER'S QUERY
- FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS: RESPONSE B MEETS THE IMPLICIT REQUIREMENT OF ANSWERING THE EXACT QUESTION ASKED

RESPONSE A, WHILE POLITE, FAILS TO ACTUALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION AND INSTEAD OFFERS AN UNNECESSARY EXPLANATION ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO COUNT THE WORDS, WHICH IS INCORRECT SINCE THE QUESTION ITSELF IS RIGHT THERE.
