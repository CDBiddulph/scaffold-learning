Original prompt: Explain why 1+1=3

Response A:
1+1=3 because when two things are combined, they become one entity, with the characteristics of both of the original things. In this case, when one adds one to one, the result is a new whole, with two sides and three sides combined, so to speak. Therefore, 1+1=3.

Response B:
I apologize, but I cannot provide an explanation for why 1+1=3 because that statement is mathematically incorrect.

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-30 22:54:28,892 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: B

REASONING:
- ACCURACY: RESPONSE B IS MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT, WHILE RESPONSE A PROVIDES A NONSENSICAL AND FALSE EXPLANATION
- RELEVANCE: RESPONSE B DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE STATEMENT
- COMPLETENESS: RESPONSE B PROVIDES A CLEAR, CONCISE RESPONSE
- CLARITY: RESPONSE B IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND
- APPROPRIATENESS: RESPONSE B TAKES A PROFESSIONAL, FACTUAL APPROACH
- HELPFULNESS: RESPONSE B PREVENTS THE SPREAD OF MATHEMATICAL MISINFORMATION
- FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS: RESPONSE B RESPONDS DIRECTLY TO THE PROMPT

RESPONSE A ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A PSEUDO-PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLANATION THAT IS MATHEMATICALLY INCORRECT AND POTENTIALLY MISLEADING. RESPONSE B IS THE SUPERIOR RESPONSE BY DEFINITIVELY STATING THE MATHEMATICAL TRUTH.
