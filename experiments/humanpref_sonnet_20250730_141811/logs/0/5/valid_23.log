2025-07-30 22:51:50,601 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: B

REASONING:
- ACCURACY: RESPONSE B CORRECTLY CALCULATES (10+5)/3 = 5 AND (10+3)/2 = 6.5, WHILE MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL EQUATIONS
- RELEVANCE: B DIRECTLY FOLLOWS THE PROMPT BY SHOWING FULL CALCULATIONS
- COMPLETENESS: B PROVIDES MORE DETAILED INFORMATION BY SHOWING THE FULL EQUATION
- CLARITY: B IS CLEAR AND WELL-STRUCTURED
- APPROPRIATENESS: B MATCHES THE JSON FORMAT REQUEST
- HELPFULNESS: B GIVES MORE INSIGHT INTO HOW THE RESULT WAS DERIVED
- FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS: B MEETS ALL SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS PRECISELY

RESPONSE A HAS A COMPUTATIONAL ERROR IN ITS INTERPRETATION, WHILE RESPONSE B PRECISELY FOLLOWS THE INSTRUCTIONS AND PROVIDES A MORE TRANSPARENT SOLUTION.
