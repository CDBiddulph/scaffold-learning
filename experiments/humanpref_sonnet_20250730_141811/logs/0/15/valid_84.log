2025-07-31 01:45:21,081 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: Let's evaluate the responses:

Response A:
- HELPFULNESS: Partially helpful, provides zone lists
- ACCURACY: Inaccurate, includes incorrect/non-Pandaria/Eastern Kingdoms zones (e.g., Skywall, Tanaris)
- COMPLETENESS: Somewhat incomplete, some repeated zones
- APPROPRIATENESS: Casual tone, but contains errors
- ENGAGEMENT: Directly addresses the request

Response B:
- HELPFULNESS: Provides zone lists
- ACCURACY: Highly inaccurate, includes many non-zone entries, dungeons, battlegrounds, and incorrect locations
- COMPLETENESS: Overly long but still inaccurate
- APPROPRIATENESS: Overwhelming and confusing response
- ENGAGEMENT: Attempts to be thorough but fails due to numerous errors

While both responses have significant flaws, Response A is slightly more concise and closer to the actual zones, despite some errors. It more directly addresses the user's request.

PREFERRED: A
