=== INPUT ===
Original prompt: Which is greater (10+5)/3 or (10+3)/2? Output your answer in JSON format with a field containing the answer to each equation and a final field with "A" if the first equation is greater and "B" if it's the second.

Response A:
{
  "equation1": 5,
  "equation2": 6.5,
  "greaterEquation": "B"
}

Response B:
{
  "equation1": (10+5)/3,
  "equation2": (10+3)/2,
  "greater": "A"
}

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 01:38:32,798 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: Let's evaluate these responses:

Response A:
- HELPFULNESS: ✓ Provides numerical results
- ACCURACY: ✓ Calculations are correct (10+5)/3 = 5, (10+3)/2 = 6.5
- COMPLETENESS: ✓ Fully answers the request
- APPROPRIATENESS: ✓ JSON format used as requested
- ENGAGEMENT: ✓ Direct and clear response

Response B:
- HELPFULNESS: ✓ Provides equation values
- ACCURACY: ✗ Incorrect greater value (should be "B", not "A")
- COMPLETENESS: ✓ Addresses all parts of request
- APPROPRIATENESS: ✓ JSON format used
- ENGAGEMENT: ✓ Responds directly

While both responses have similar strengths, Response B has an accuracy error in the "greater" field. Response A provides the correct calculation and conclusion.

PREFERRED: A
2025-07-31 01:38:32,798 [INFO] Final evaluation result: Answer: A
