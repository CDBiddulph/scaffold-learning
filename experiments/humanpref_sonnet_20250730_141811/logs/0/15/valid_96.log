2025-07-31 01:46:40,424 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: Let's evaluate the responses:

Response A:
- Helpfulness: Low (very generic, no specific guidance)
- Accuracy: Neutral (no factual claims made)
- Completeness: Poor (doesn't provide substantive advice)
- Appropriateness: Somewhat appropriate but minimal
- Engagement: Basic initial engagement, asks for more details

Response B:
- Helpfulness: High (provides specific, actionable interview preparation tips)
- Accuracy: High (advice is relevant and professional)
- Completeness: Very good (covers multiple aspects of interview preparation)
- Appropriateness: Excellent (professional tone, targeted advice)
- Engagement: Strong (directly addresses interview preparation needs)

Response B clearly offers much more substantive and practical guidance for preparing for a British Council interview. It provides specific steps, areas of focus, and strategic advice that would genuinely help someone prepare.

While Response A shows willingness to help, it lacks the depth and practical support that Response B delivers.

PREFERRED: B
