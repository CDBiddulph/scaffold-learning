Response A:
1. HELPFULNESS: Provides a polite response and proactively offers assistance ✓
2. ACCURACY: Straightforward and truthful ✓
3. COMPLETENESS: Fully addresses the greeting and moves to offer help ✓
4. APPROPRIATENESS: Professional and friendly tone ✓
5. ENGAGEMENT: Directly responds and invites further interaction ✓

Response B:
1. HELPFULNESS: Minimally helpful, simply mirrors the greeting ✗
2. ACCURACY: Truthful but lacks substantive content ✓
3. COMPLETENESS: Does not offer any additional value or direction ✗
4. APPROPRIATENESS: Casual but less professional ✗
5. ENGAGEMENT: Passive response that does not advance the conversation ✗

Response A is more structured, professional, and purpose-driven. It not only responds to the greeting but also proactively offers assistance, which is more aligned with an AI assistant's role.
