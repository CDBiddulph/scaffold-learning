Original prompt: How many words are in this question?

Response A:
Unfortunately I do not have access to the exact text of the question you asked, so I cannot count the number of words. As an AI assistant without access to the full context, I cannot determine the number of words in previous statements or questions. I'd be happy to help if you provide the specific text you would like me to analyze or ask another question.

Response B:
7

Which response was preferred? Write "Answer: A" or "Answer: B".

2025-07-31 01:39:03,906 [INFO] LLM evaluation result: Analysis:

Response A:
- Helpfulness: Low (does not provide a direct answer)
- Accuracy: Technically correct that context is missing
- Completeness: Partially addresses request but offers no solution
- Appropriateness: Overly complicated response
- Engagement: Weak, deflects from straightforward task

Response B:
- Helpfulness: High (provides direct, immediate answer)
- Accuracy: Correct (the question "How many words are in this question?..." indeed has 7 words)
- Completeness: Fully addresses request
- Appropriateness: Clear and concise
- Engagement: Strong, directly solves the user's query

The key difference is that Response B directly solves the task with minimal explanation, while Response A overcomplicates a simple request.

PREFERRED: B
