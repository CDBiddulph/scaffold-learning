2025-08-19 23:49:10,662 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this systematically by analyzing each symmetry in the context of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT):

1. Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental requirement for any relativistic quantum field theory
- Ensures physical laws are invariant under coordinate transformations
- SMEFT mus...
