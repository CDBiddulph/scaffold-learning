=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:12,446 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we'll use Coulomb's law to calculate the electrostatic potential energy of the system.
   - The charge at point P is q1 = 2e
   - Each of the 12 other charges is also q2 = 2e
   - The distance between each charge and the central charge is r = 2 m

2) Coulomb...
