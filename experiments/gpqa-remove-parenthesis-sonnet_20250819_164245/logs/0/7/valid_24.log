=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:09,812 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step using relativistic calculations:

1) First, calculate the distance traveled in 1e-5s for each particle type:

• Zeta (0.96c): 
- Distance = 0.96 * c * 1e-5s 
- Distance = 0.96 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 2880 meters

• Eta (0.9c):
- Distance = 0.9 * c * 1e-5s
- Distance = 0.9 * 3e8 ...
