=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

2025-08-19 23:49:10,235 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) The state ψ is given as (3i, 4)
   This means ψ = [3i, 4]^T (transposed column vector)

3) σ_y matrix is given as:
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}

4) Compute...
