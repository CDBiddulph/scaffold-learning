2025-08-19 23:49:05,728 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Density Calculation Basics:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• For spherical objects, Volume = (4/3)πR³

2. Option A (Earth-mass and radius):
• This is essentially an Earth-like planet
• Earth's density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³
• No change in density from standard Ear...
