=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B 0.19


C) 0.21

2025-08-19 23:49:11,051 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step using Wien's displacement law and Stefan-Boltzmann law:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to surface temperature:
• T ∝ (Peak Energy)
• Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV
• Star A's peak energy: 7.21 eV

2) Temperature ratio calculation:
• T(Star A)/T(Sun) ...
