=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:14,036 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this systematically:

1. First, let's understand the context:
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models are extensions of the Standard Model
- Oblique Parameters characterize potential new physics
- Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance effects in particle physics

2. Oblique Parameters (S, T,...
