2025-08-19 23:49:10,477 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: trans-cinnamaldehyde
• trans-cinnamaldehyde has 9 carbon atoms
• Its structure is C6H5-CH=CH-CHO (a benzene ring with a 3-carbon aldehyde side chain)

2. First reaction with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent)
• This adds a methyl group to...
