2025-08-19 23:49:11,860 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the Cope rearrangement:
- It's a concerted thermal rearrangement
- Involves a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement
- Typically occurs with 1,5-dienes
- Involves migration of sigma bonds and pi bonds

2) Analyze the starting molecule structure:
- ...
