=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:08,141 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Starting Material Analysis:
- 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol has two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons
- The reaction involves acid treatment, which suggests elimination/dehydration

2. IR Spectroscopy Interpretation:
- The band at 1690 cm^-1 is characteristic of ...
