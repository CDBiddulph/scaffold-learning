=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:49:09,645 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the conditions for optical activity:
- Requires a molecule with a chiral carbon center
- Chiral carbon must have 4 different substituents
- Saturated hydrocarbon means only single bonds

2) Analyze the molecular formulas:
- Empirical formula method: D...
