=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:08,740 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, note the distance is 137 meters, which is suggestive of the fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137.

2) The fine structure constant is a fundamental dimensionless physical constant that characterizes the strength of electromagnetic interaction between elementary ...
