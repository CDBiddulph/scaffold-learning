=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:49:10,462 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key principles involved:
• Special relativity governs light propagation
• Relativistic velocity transformation is key
• Speed of light in vacuum is constant (c=1 in this problem)

2) In relativistic velocity addition, the formula is:
u' = (u - v) ...
