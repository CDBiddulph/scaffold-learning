=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:49:10,562 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Starting material:
- bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a ketone in a rigid bicyclic ring system

2. UV Irradiation (Product 1):
- UV radiation typically induces photochemical reactions
- The molecular weight remains the same
- This suggests a photochemical rearrangeme...
