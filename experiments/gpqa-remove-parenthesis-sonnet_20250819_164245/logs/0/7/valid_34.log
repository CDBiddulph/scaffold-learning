=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:09,724 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this systematically:

1. First, let's analyze the pattern in the given inputs:
• AGG → 115
• TGCTGA → 176

2. This looks like a pattern where the input sequence is being transformed by some rule or algorithm.

3. Let's count some characteristics of the inputs:
• AGG (3 nucleotides): 115
