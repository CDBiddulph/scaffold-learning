=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:07,262 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step-by-step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent Effects on Para/Ortho Directing:
- Activating groups (electron-donating) tend to direct to para and ortho positions
- Deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing) typically reduce...
