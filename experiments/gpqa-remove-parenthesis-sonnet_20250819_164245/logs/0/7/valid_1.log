=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:07,071 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Caesium-137 Decay Characteristics:
- Cs-137 decays by beta emission and subsequent gamma ray emission
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
- Each decaying atom typically emits a gamma ray

2. Number of Decaying Atoms:
- Total atoms = 10^17
- In 80 minute...
