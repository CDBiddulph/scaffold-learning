2025-08-19 23:49:08,497 [INFO] Expert analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between angular size (θ), distance (d), and actual size (R):
   θ = R/d (in radians)
   Here, θ = 10^-17 degrees = 10^-19 radians

2) Rearrange to find the radius (R):
   R = θ * d = 10^-19 * 10^10 parsecs = 10^-9 parsecs

3) Convert ...
