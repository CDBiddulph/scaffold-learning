=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-20 00:16:42,445 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline: Astrophysics (Stellar Physics)
Key Concepts: Blackbody radiation, Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's displacement law

2. Step-by-Step Solution:
• Peak energy relates to surface temperature via Wien's displacement law
• For the sun: Peak at 1.41 eV
• For star A: Peak at 7.21 eV

3. Calculate relative temperatures:
• Temperature is proportional to peak energy
• T_A/T_sun = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4. Use Stefan-Boltzmann law:
• Luminosity ∝ (Radius)² × (Temperature)⁴
• Given: Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

5. Set up equation:
• (R_A/R_sun)² × (T_A/T_sun)⁴ = 24
• (R_A/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴ = 24
• (R_A/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
• R_A/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
• R_A/R_sun ≈ 0.19

6. Evaluate options: Option B (0.19) matches calculation

Final answer: B
