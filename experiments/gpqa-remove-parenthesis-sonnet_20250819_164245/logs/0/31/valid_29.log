Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-20 00:17:53,055 [INFO] Found options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-20 00:17:58,744 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline and Key Concepts:
- Organic Chemistry
- Stereochemistry
- Hydrocarbon analysis
- Key concept: Optical activity requires a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)

2. Analysis Steps:
a) Analyze the percentage composition first
- All percentages look close to C6H12 molecular formula
- Molecular mass will be important

b) Look for conditions for optical activity
- Requires asymmetric carbon (unequal substituents)
- Requires at least one chiral center

c) Examine molecular mass details from EI-MS

3. Detailed Option Evaluation:
A) C6H12 (72 molecular mass)
- Linear structure, no chiral center
- Not optically active

B) C6H14 (86 molecular mass)
- Could have branched structure with chiral center
- Potential for optical activity

C) Lower molecular mass, likely too small
- Probably not optically active

D) Larger molecular mass (100)
- Could have potential for optical activity

4. Reasoning Conclusion:
- Option B has the best potential for a branched structure with a chiral center

Final answer: B
