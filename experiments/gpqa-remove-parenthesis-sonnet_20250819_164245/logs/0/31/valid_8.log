2025-08-20 00:17:57,306 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline and Concepts:
- This is a chemistry problem involving complex formation and equilibrium
- Key concepts: Complex formation constant (K), EDTA complexation, ion concentration calculation

2. Problem Solving Steps:
- We're given a Ca-EDTA complex with concentration 0.02 M
- KCa-EDTA = 5 × 10^10 (very large, indicates strong complex formation)
- We want to find the free calcium ion concentration

3. Equilibrium Expression:
Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻
K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4. Rearrange the Equation:
[Ca²⁺] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5. Plug in Known Values:
- [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M
- K = 5 × 10^10

6. Calculation:
[Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10^10) × (0.02) = 1.0 × 10^-7 M

7. Option Evaluation:
A) 1.0×10^-2 M - Too high
B) 6.3×10^-7 M - Close but not exact
C) 5.0×10^-3 M - Too high
D) 2.0×10^-2 M - Too high

8. Closest Match: B

Final answer: B
2025-08-20 00:17:57,307 [INFO] Final answer: B
