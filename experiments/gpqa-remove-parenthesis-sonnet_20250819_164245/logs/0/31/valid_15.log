=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:17:55,755 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline and Concepts
- This is a quantum field theory problem
- Specifically about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations
- Key concept is analyzing the number of loops based on a dimensional analysis of the given expression

2. Analyzing the Expression
- The expression α³ * g² * √2 * 8 * 1/(4π)⁶ * (Q/M)²
- Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes additional powers of energy scales
- We want to extract the number of loops from the dimensional structure

3. Dimensional Analysis
- (4π)⁻⁶ suggests a power of -6 in the denominator
- One loop typically contributes a factor of (energy)⁻²
- So -6 in the denominator suggests 3 loops (3 * 2 = 6)

4. Verification
- Option A: 6 loops would match the -6 power
- Other options do not align with the dimensional structure

5. Reasoning Confirmation
- The structure of (4π)⁻⁶ strongly indicates 3 loops
