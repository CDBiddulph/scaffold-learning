S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-20 00:17:50,603 [INFO] Found options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-20 00:17:57,540 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline: Organic Chemistry
Key Concepts: Organic synthesis, silylation, organocuprate chemistry, alkylation, and hydrolysis

2. Step-by-step reaction breakdown:

Step 1: TBDMSCl + Et3N
• Silylation of the hydroxyl group
• Protects the hydroxyl group
• Forms a silyl ether derivative

Step 2: Ph2CuLi, then benzyl bromide
• Organocuprate reagent adds a phenyl group
• Benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group
• Creates a new carbon-carbon bond

Step 3: LDA, then iodomethane
• LDA deprotonates at an α-position
• Methyl group added via alkylation
• Creates a new methyl substituent

Step 4: Aqueous HCl
• Removes silyl protecting group
• Restores the original hydroxyl group

3. Evaluating products:
• A stereochemistry is important
• A phenyl and benzyl group are added
• A methyl group is added
• Hydroxyl group is restored

4. Structural analysis suggests the structure matches option A.
