2025-08-20 00:16:42,474 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline and Concepts:
- This problem involves astrophysics
- Key concepts: Black hole physics, entropy, angular size

2. Problem Analysis:
- Given: Distance (d) = 10^10 parsecs
- Angular size (θ) = 10^-17 degrees

3. Calculating Black Hole Entropy:
- For black holes, entropy is proportional to the surface area of the event horizon
- The Bekenstein-Hawking formula relates black hole entropy to its area
- Entropy (S) ∝ Area of event horizon

4. Estimating Event Horizon Size:
- Use angular size formula: θ = size/distance
- Size ≈ θ * distance
- Size ≈ 10^-17 * 10^10 = 10^-7 parsecs

5. Entropy Calculation:
- Black hole entropy scales as (R)^2, where R is radius
- Entropy will be proportional to 10^-14 
- By Bekenstein-Hawking formula, this suggests entropy around 10^62-10^66 J/K

6. Option Evaluation:
- Options B (10^66), C (10^62), and D (10^65) are close
- Option C looks most consistent with our reasoning
