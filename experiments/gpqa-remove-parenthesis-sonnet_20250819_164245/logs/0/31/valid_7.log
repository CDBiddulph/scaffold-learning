=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-20 00:17:59,345 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline and Concepts:
- Quantum Computing
- Quantum Gates (specifically C-NOT gate)
- Quantum State Manipulation
- Tensor Product Operations

2. Problem Analysis:
- Input state: \left|\psi\right\rangle = \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
- C-NOT gate condition: First qubit (control qubit) must be \left|0\right\rangle

3. C-NOT Gate Operation:
- When control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle, target qubit remains unchanged
- When control qubit is \left|1\right\rangle, target qubit is flipped

4. Analyzing Options:
- Option A: State is unchanged (since control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle)
- Option B: Target qubit changes to \left|1\right\rangle without reason
- Option C: Partial state change, not consistent with C-NOT rules
- Option D: Partial state change, not consistent with C-NOT rules

5. Reasoning:
- Control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle
- Target qubit should remain \left|0\right\rangle
- Overall state remains the same
