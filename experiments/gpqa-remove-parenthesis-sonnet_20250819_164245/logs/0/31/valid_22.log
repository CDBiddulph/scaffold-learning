=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:49,116 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline: Organic Chemistry (Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution)

2. Key Concepts:
- Electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction
- Substituent effects on reactivity
- Electronic effects of different groups on the benzene ring

3. Analyzing Substituent Effects:
For electrophilic substitution, we need to evaluate how different substituents activate or deactivate the ring:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Methyl group is strongly activating
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): Weakly deactivating
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Mildly deactivating
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Activating
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): Weakly deactivating

4. Ordering Reactivity (from most reactive to least):
Most reactive: Toluene (1)
Least reactive: Nitrobenzene (4)

5. Detailed Reactivity Order:
5 (ethylbenzene) > 1 (toluene) > 3 (chlorobenzene) > 6 (benzoic acid) > 2 (ethyl benzoate) > 4 (nitrobenzene)

6. Matching with Given Options:
This corresponds to option D.
