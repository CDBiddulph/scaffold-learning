=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:44,853 [INFO] LLM response: Let me solve this systematically:

1. Scientific Discipline and Concepts
- Particle Physics
- Multi-Higgs-Doublet Models
- Oblique Parameters (quantum corrections to electroweak precision observables)
- Breit-Wigner corrections (quantum mechanical line shape corrections)
- New Physics constraints

2. Reasoning Steps
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) characterize potential quantum corrections
- Breit-Wigner corrections describe resonance line shapes
- Multi-Higgs models introduce additional scalar fields that can modify these parameters
- Precision requires understanding subtle quantum corrections

3. Option Evaluation
A) Seems plausible if original parameters are already precise
B) "Big difference" is an exaggerated claim
C) Mass dependence suggests nuanced physics
D) Claiming no difference seems unlikely given quantum complexity

4. Detailed Analysis
- Breit-Wigner corrections typically provide refined quantum mechanical descriptions
- In multi-Higgs scenarios, these corrections could indeed offer more precise constraints
- Charged scalar masses will influence the correction magnitude

5. Conclusion
The most scientifically sound answer appears to be option C, acknowledging the mass-dependent nature of the corrections.
