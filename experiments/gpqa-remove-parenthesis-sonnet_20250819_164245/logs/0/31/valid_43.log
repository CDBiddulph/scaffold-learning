=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-20 00:16:46,693 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Scientific Discipline and Concepts:
- This is a molecular biology problem involving PCR, cloning, and restriction enzyme digestion
- Key tasks: Correctly amplify a DNA sequence and prepare it for directional cloning

2. Problem Analysis:
- We need to use two different restriction enzymes
- These enzymes will enable directional (oriented) cloning into an expression vector
- We want to ensure the gene is in the correct reading frame for expression

3. Restriction Enzyme Recognition:
- HindIII: recognizes AAGCTT
- KpnI: recognizes GGTACC
- BamHI: recognizes GGATCC
- SmaI: recognizes CCCGGG

4. Analyzing Options:
- Look at first enzyme recognition site (first part of sequence)
- Look at second enzyme site
- Ensure different enzymes are used
- Check that start codon (ATG) is preserved

5. Detailed Option Evaluation:
- Option A: HindIII and KpnI - OK
- Option B: HindIII and BamHI - Different enzymes ✓
- Option C: SmaI and BamHI - Different enzymes ✓
- Option D: BamHI and HindIII - Different enzymes ✓

6. Final Selection Criteria:
- Option B provides the best combination for directional cloning
- Different restriction sites
- Preserves start codon
- Allows precise orientation

Final answer: B
