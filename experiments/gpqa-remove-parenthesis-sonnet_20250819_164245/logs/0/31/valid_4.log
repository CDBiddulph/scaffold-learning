=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:45,814 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Discipline and Concepts
- This is a problem in nuclear physics and probability
- Key concepts: Radioactive decay, conditional probability
- We're dealing with the probability of decay over time

2. Problem Analysis
- Initial decay probability within 100 minutes: 32%
- 50 minutes have already passed
- We want to know decay probability for next 150 minutes

3. Reasoning
- First, note that 50 minutes have passed without decay
- This means the remaining decay window is extended to 200 minutes (50 + 150)
- We want to calculate the conditional probability of decay in next 150 minutes, given no decay so far

4. Mathematical Approach
- Probability of no decay in 50 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
- Remaining probability of decay must adjust based on this survival
- New probability = Total decay probability spread over extended time

5. Calculation
- Decay probability = 1 - (Probability of no decay)
- This becomes (1 - (0.68 * (remaining decay probability)))
- This results in approximately 0.48 or 48%

6. Option Evaluation
- 48% matches option A
