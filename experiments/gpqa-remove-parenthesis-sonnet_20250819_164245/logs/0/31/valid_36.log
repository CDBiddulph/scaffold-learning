=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:43,917 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Discipline and Key Concepts:
- Astronomy
- Satellite observations
- Object localization precision
- Distance scales
- Isotropic distribution

2. Analyze the Key Information:
- Localization precision: 100-200 arc minutes
- Distribution is isotropic (uniform in all directions)
- Need to determine possible distance ranges

3. Reasoning about Localization:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular measurement
- This suggests the objects are at considerable distances
- Localization precision implies the objects are not extremely close

4. Evaluate Options:
A) 1M or 1B light years: Too large, would not match precision
B) 1K or 100K light years: Within galactic scale, matches precision
C) 10 or 100 light years: Too close, precision too high
D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds: Far too close, near-solar system scale

5. Detailed Assessment:
- Option B matches the observation scale of astronomical objects
- Covers distances within our galaxy
- Consistent with localization precision
- Represents a realistic range for satellite observations

Final answer: B
2025-08-20 00:16:43,917 [INFO] Final answer: B
