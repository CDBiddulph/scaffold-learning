=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:29,624 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the relative reactivity of each compound in electrophilic aromatic substitution with bromine:

Key Considerations:
- Substituents can activate or deactivate the benzene ring
- Activating groups increase reactivity (electron-donating)
- Deactivating groups decrease reactivity (electron-withdrawing)

Analyzing each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Strongly activating, meta/para directing (+I effect)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): Weakly deactivating, meta directing
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Weakly deactivating, para directing
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta directing
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Moderately activating, meta/para directing
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta directing

Reactivity order (from most to least reactive):
1 (toluene) > 5 (ethylbenzene) > 3 (chlorobenzene) > 6 (benzoic acid) > 2 (ethyl benzoate) > 4 (nitrobenzene)

This matches option D: 3<5<1<6<2<4
