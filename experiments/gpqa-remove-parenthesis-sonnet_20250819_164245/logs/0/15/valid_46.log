2025-08-19 23:55:31,827 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1) This problem involves stellar radiation and relates to Wien's displacement law and stellar luminosity.

2) Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is inversely proportional to its temperature:

λmax = b/T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 × 10^-3 m·K)

3) Peak energy is related to peak wavelength by E = hc/λ
• For the sun: peaks at 1.41 eV
• For star A: peaks at 7.21 eV

4) Temperature relationship:
T ∝ (peak energy)
T_star A / T_sun = (7.21 eV) / (1.41 eV) = 5.11

5) Luminosity equation: L = 4πR²σT^4
• Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun
• (R_A/R_sun)² × (T_A/T_sun)^4 = 24

6) Solving algebraically:
(R_A/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)^4
(R_A/R_sun) = √(24 / (5.11)^4)
(R_A/R_sun) ≈ 0.17

7) Checking the options, 0.17 corresponds to option D.
