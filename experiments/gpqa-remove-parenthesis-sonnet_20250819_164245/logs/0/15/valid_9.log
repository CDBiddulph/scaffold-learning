2025-08-19 23:55:24,790 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the molecular structure:
• 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid has:
- A cyclohexene ring
- A vinyl group
- An aldehyde (formyl) group
- A carboxylic acid group

2. Reaction conditions:
• Red phosphorus and excess HI typically cause:
- Reduction of the aldehyde group to an alcohol
- Hydrogenation of the alkene (vinyl) group
- Possible reduction of the carboxylic acid group

3. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) calculation:
• IHD measures the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule
• Formula: IHD = (2C + 2 - H - X)/2, where C = carbons, H = hydrogens, X = halogens

4. After reduction:
• The aldehyde becomes an alcohol
• The vinyl group becomes fully saturated
• The carboxylic acid likely remains unchanged

5. Result:
• Rings remaining: 1
• Double bonds eliminated: 1

6. Therefore, the IHD would be 1
