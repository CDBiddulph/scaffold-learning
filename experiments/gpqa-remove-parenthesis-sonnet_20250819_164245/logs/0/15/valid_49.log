=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:55:29,964 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
- This is a bicyclic ketone with a rigid cage-like structure

2. UV irradiation → Product 1
- Since the molecular weight remains the same, this suggests a photochemical reaction
- Likely a Norrish Type II reaction, where the C-H bond adjacent to the carbonyl cleaves
- This would form a diradical intermediate that rearranges

3. Pd/C, H2 → Product 2
- This indicates hydrogenation
- The hydrogen will saturate any unsaturated bonds
- The most deshielded hydrogen will likely be the one closest to the carbonyl group

4. NMR splitting pattern analysis
- The proximity to the carbonyl and potential neighboring hydrogens will determine the splitting
- Presence of nearby chemically non-equivalent hydrogens suggests a doublet of doublets
- The hydrogens will have different coupling constants due to the rigid cage structure

5. Systematic elimination
- A (doublet of doublets) matches the structural constraints
- B (singlet) would imply no neighboring hydrogens
- C (triplet) suggests symmetrical environment
- D (doublet) requires specific coupling conditions
