S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-19 23:55:18,521 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:55:25,251 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction: S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDMSCl + Et3N
- This creates a silyl ether, protecting the hydroxyl group
- Likely creates a TBS-protected cyclohexenone

2) Second reaction: Ph2CuLi at low temp, then benzyl bromide
- This is a conjugate addition followed by alkylation
- Adds a phenyl group via copper chemistry
- Then introduces a benzyl group
- Creates a new C-C bond

3) Third reaction: LDA and iodomethane
- This is an alkylation reaction
- Adds a methyl group at the Î±-position
- Uses lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base to generate an enolate

4) Final reaction: Aqueous HCl
- This removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the hydroxyl group
- Likely results in a phenyl-substituted cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group

5) Analyzing the stereochemistry and structural features of the options:
- The molecule has a hydroxyl group
- Contains phenyl and benzyl substituents
- Has a methyl group
- Cyclohexanone ring structure

6) Comparing the stereochemistry carefully, option C matches these requirements precisely.
