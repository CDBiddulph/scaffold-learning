=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:29,750 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let me carefully analyze this theoretical physics problem:

Key Scientific Concepts:
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models are extensions of the Standard Model
- Oblique Parameters are quantum corrections parametrizing potential new physics
- Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance effects in quantum field theory

Systematic Analysis:
1. Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) characterize quantum corrections to electroweak precision observables
2. In multi-Higgs-doublet models, additional scalar fields can modify these parameters
3. Breit-Wigner corrections account for resonance effects near particle mass thresholds

Reasoning:
- The charged scalar masses significantly impact quantum corrections
- Breit-Wigner corrections can provide more nuanced constraints by capturing resonance effects
- The constraints depend sensitively on the specific mass spectrum of the additional Higgs bosons

Elimination Process:
- Option A seems too absolute
- Option B lacks nuance
- Option D suggests no difference, which is unlikely
- Option C acknowledges mass-dependent effects, which matches theoretical expectations

This suggests the most scientifically rigorous answer captures the mass-dependent nature of the corrections.
