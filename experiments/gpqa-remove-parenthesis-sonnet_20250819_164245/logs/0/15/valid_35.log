=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

2025-08-19 23:55:35,136 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Context:
- Hi-C revealed a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- The interaction spans ~1 Mb linear distance
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. Key Observations:
- Hi-C is a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technique
- FISH is a single-cell imaging technique
- The interaction seems functionally real (evidence from dCas9-KRAB experiment)

3. Potential Reasons for Inconsistency:
A) Low interaction frequency would explain why FISH can't detect it consistently
B) Structural variation could modify interaction expectations
C) 1 Mb is not too short for FISH - this is unlikely
D) False-positive Hi-C signals do occur, but functional validation suggests this isn't the case

4. Critical Analysis:
- The dCas9-KRAB experiment shows a real functional interaction
- Hi-C works on population-level data, while FISH looks at individual cells
- Population-level interactions might be too weak/transient to consistently show in single-cell FISH

5. Reasoning Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH.
