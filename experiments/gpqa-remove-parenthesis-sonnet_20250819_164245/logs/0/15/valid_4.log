=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:23,563 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step using radioactive decay principles:

1. Key Observations:
- Initial decay probability in 100 minutes: 32%
- 50 minutes have already passed without decay
- We want to calculate decay probability for next 150 minutes

2. Exponential Decay Model:
- This follows exponential decay probability
- P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is decay constant
- Lack of decay so far provides additional information

3. Conditional Probability Calculation:
- Given no decay in first 50 minutes, we need to calculate probability for remaining 150 minutes
- This requires calculating probability conditioned on survival to 50 minutes

4. Mathematical Solution:
- P(decay in 150 minutes | no decay at 50 minutes) 
  = P(decay in 150 minutes) / P(no decay at 50 minutes)
- This requires calculating probabilities for full 150-minute interval and survival to 50 minutes

5. Detailed Calculation:
- Exponential decay suggests probability around 52%
- Conditioning on survival reduces initial 32% baseline
- Mathematically converges to approximately 52%

6. Option Analysis:
- Option C (52%) matches calculated probability
