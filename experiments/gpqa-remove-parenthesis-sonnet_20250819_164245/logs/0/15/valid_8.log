2025-08-19 23:55:26,927 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have a Ca-EDTA complex with a concentration of 0.02 M
   - KCa-EDTA = 5 × 10^10 (stability constant)

2. The equilibrium reaction can be written as:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

3. The stability constant expression is:
   Kstab = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4. Rearranging the equation to solve for [Ca²⁺]:
   [Ca²⁺] = Kstab × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5. Since the total concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, and assuming complete dissociation:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10^10) × (0.02) / 1
   
6. Calculating:
   [Ca²⁺] = 1.0 × 10^-7 M

7. Comparing with the given options, 6.3 × 10^-7 M is closest to our calculated value.
