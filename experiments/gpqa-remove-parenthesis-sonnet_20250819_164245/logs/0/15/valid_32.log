=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-19 23:55:27,729 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Nernst Equation Analysis:
- We have Fe(III)/Fe(II) system
- Standard reduction potential E0 = 0.77 V
- Initial concentrations of Fe(III) and Fe(II) are both 0.01 M
- pH is 1.0
- Phosphate concentration is 0.1 M
- H2PO4^- equilibrium concentration is 6.97x10^-3 M

2. Complex Formation Impact:
- Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex formation constant is 10^21
- This suggests strong complexation will occur, reducing free Fe(III) concentration

3. Nernst Equation Calculation:
E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])
- At standard conditions and equal concentrations, this term becomes zero
- However, complex formation will shift equilibrium

4. Complexation Effect:
- High complex formation constant means most Fe(III) will be complexed
- This will effectively reduce free Fe(III) concentration
- Shifts redox potential negatively

5. Detailed Calculation (Complex):
- High stability constant suggests near-complete complexation
- This will significantly lower the redox potential

6. Estimated Potential Shift:
Comparing the given options, the significant complex formation suggests a negative shift.

The closest match is -0.34 V.
