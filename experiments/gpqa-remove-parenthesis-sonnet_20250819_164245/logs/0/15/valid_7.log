=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-19 23:55:23,100 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the C-NOT gate:
- C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate flips the target qubit only if the control qubit is |1⟩
- In this case, the condition is the control qubit must be |0⟩

2. Analyze the input state:
- |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩
- First component is a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩
- Second component is definitively |0⟩

3. Apply C-NOT gate rules:
- Since the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged
- This means the output state will have the same first part
- The target qubit will stay |0⟩

4. Examine the options:
- Option A maintains the original state
- Other options modify the state or target qubit differently

5. Verify Option A systematically:
- First part: (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)
- Second part: |0⟩
- Perfectly matches the input state's structure

Therefore, the output preserves the original state.
