=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:19,357 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:55:26,335 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Key scientific concepts in the Wnt3a signaling pathway:
- Wnt3a is a secreted glycoprotein ligand
- Binds to frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor
- Involves Beta-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation
- Leads to transcriptional activation of target genes

2. Evaluating each option carefully:

Option A:
- "Translocation into nucleus" ✓ Correct
- "Intracellular calcium" ✓ Correct
- "Destruction complex" ✓ Correct
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct
This option contains ALL scientifically accurate terms

Option B:
- "Proteosomal degradation" ✓ Correct
- "N-terminal extracellular" ✓ Correct
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct
- "Non-canonical" ✓ Correct
This option also contains scientifically accurate terms

Option C:
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct
- "Directly binds DNA" ✓ Correct
- "LRP5/6" ✓ Correct
- "Transmembrane receptor protein" ✓ Correct
This option also contains accurate terms

Option D:
- "Transcriptional co-activator" ✓ Correct
- "Glycoprotein" ✓ Correct
- "Accumulation in cytoplasm" ✓ Correct
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct
This option also contains accurate terms

3. Analysis:
All options seem scientifically accurate. However, the question asks for the group with ONLY correct terms.

4. Careful re-examination shows Option A is the most precise and complete representation of the signaling pathway terms.
