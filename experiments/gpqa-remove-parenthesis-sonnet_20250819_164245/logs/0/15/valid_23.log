2025-08-19 23:55:18,519 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:55:25,247 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the relationship between absolute and apparent magnitude:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 * log10(Distance/10 parsecs)

2. Analyze each option:

a) A star with apparent V magnitude of 7 at 50 parsecs:
   No further calculation needed

b) A star with apparent V magnitude of 7 at 20 parsecs:
   No further calculation needed

c) Two-star system at 5 parsecs with Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8:
   For this system: Combined brightness = 10^(-0.4 * Vmag_1) + 10^(-0.4 * Vmag_2)
   Actual calculation shows this will be very bright due to close distance

d) A star with absolute magnitude 7 at 10 parsecs:
   Apparent magnitude will be exactly 7 by definition of absolute magnitude

e) Two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8 at 10 parsecs:
   Needs detailed calculation of combined brightness

f) Two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 7 at 10 parsecs:
   Combined brightness will be brighter than single star

3. Calculation reveals option (c) will be brightest due to:
   - Very close distance (5 parsecs)
   - Substantial brightness of both stars
   - Brightness scales as 1/distanceÂ²

Answer: C
