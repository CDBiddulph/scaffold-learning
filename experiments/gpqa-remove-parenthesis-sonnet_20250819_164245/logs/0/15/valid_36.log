=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:31,619 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Key observations:
- Satellites detect astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- Object distribution is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Localization precision analysis:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests the objects are at significant distances
- Precision implies objects are not extremely close or extremely far

3. Distance considerations:
A) 1 million/billion light years: Too distant for reasonable detection
   - Would require extremely sensitive instruments
   - Localization precision would be much worse

B) 1,000-100,000 light years:
   - Matches typical galactic/local group scales
   - Consistent with uniform distribution
   - Reasonable detection range for satellites
   - Angular uncertainty matches observation

C) 10-100 light years:
   - Too close to provide meaningful astronomical survey
   - Would not represent an isotropic distribution
   - Too small a scale for systematic detection

D) 10 light minutes/100 light seconds:
   - Within solar system scale
   - Far too close for astronomical object survey
   - Not representative of isotropic distribution

4. Conclusion: Option B provides the most scientifically plausible distance range.
