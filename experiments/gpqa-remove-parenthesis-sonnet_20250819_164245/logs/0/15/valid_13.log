2025-08-19 23:55:26,993 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Context:
- SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory
- We're examining which symmetries must be fundamental to this theory

2. Analyzing Each Symmetry:

a) Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental to relativity
- Describes how physical laws remain consistent across different reference frames
- CRITICAL for any relativistic field theory
- MUST be respected

b) Poincaré Symmetry:
- Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
- Essential for consistent quantum field theories
- MUST be respected

c) CP Symmetry:
- Combined charge conjugation and parity transformation
- Known to be violated in weak interactions
- NOT universally required in SMEFT

d) CPT Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal
- A fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
- Considered a very deep symmetry of nature
- Strongly believed to be universally respected

3. Elimination Process:
- Lorentz symmetry: Required ✓
- Poincaré symmetry: Required ✓
- CP symmetry: Not universally required ✗
- CPT symmetry: Fundamental ✓

4. Conclusion:
The symmetries that MUST be respected are Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries.
