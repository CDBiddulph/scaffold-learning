=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:55:26,291 [INFO] Question extracted (first 150 chars): Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?...
2025-08-19 23:55:26,291 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:55:33,505 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key Characteristics of the Question:
- Looking for an optically active saturated hydrocarbon
- Evaluating elemental composition and mass spectrometry data

2. Optically Active Requirements:
- Must have asymmetric carbon centers (chiral)
- At least one carbon with four different substituents
- Cannot have a plane of symmetry

3. Saturated Hydrocarbon Requirements:
- Only single bonds between carbons
- No rings or double/triple bonds
- General formula CnH2n+2

4. Analyzing Options:
A) C6H12 (molecular formula)
   - Symmetric structure, likely not optically active
   - Fragments consistent with alkane

B) C6H14 (molecular formula)
   - Potential for asymmetric carbon
   - Correct saturated hydrocarbon composition
   - Possible chiral structure

C) Lower molecular weight, less likely to be chiral
D) Higher molecular weight, but structure suggests symmetry

5. Detailed Evaluation of Option B:
- Molecular weight matches
- Potential for optical activity
- Mass spectrum consistent with branched alkane

6. Conclusion:
Option B provides the most scientifically plausible data for an optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
