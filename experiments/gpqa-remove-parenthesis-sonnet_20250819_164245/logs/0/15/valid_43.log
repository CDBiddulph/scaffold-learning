=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-19 23:55:26,429 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'C', 'B', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:55:32,670 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's identify the restriction enzyme sites in each sequence:
- HindIII site = AAGCTT
- KpnI site = GGTACC
- BamHI site = GGATCC
- SmaI site = CCCGGG

2. For proper subcloning, we need:
- One enzyme at the 5' end to start the gene
- A different enzyme at the 3' end for directional cloning
- These sites should be in the correct orientation

3. Analyzing the sequences:
A) 5' end: HindIII (AAGCTT)
   3' end: KpnI (GGTACC)

B) 5' end: HindIII (AAGCTT)
   3' end: BamHI (GGATCC)

C) 5' end: SmaI (CCCGGG)
   3' end: BamHI (GGATCC)

D) 5' end: BamHI (GGATCC)
   3' end: HindIII (AAGCTT)

4. Best option requires:
- Different enzymes
- Allows correct orientation
- Provides clean cut sites

5. Option D provides:
- Different enzymes (BamHI and HindIII)
- Correct orientation for expression
- Clean restriction sites

Answer: D
