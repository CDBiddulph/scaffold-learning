=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:27,706 [INFO] LLM reasoning: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analysis of the Expression:
- The expression contains several terms: alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8, 1/(4pi)^6, (Q/M)^2
- In quantum field theory, loop diagrams are associated with the power of the coupling constant and the complexity of the diagram

2. Loop Counting Rules:
- The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can often be estimated by the power and scaling of the diagram's amplitude
- Each loop typically introduces an additional factor of the coupling constant or energy scale

3. Key Observations:
- The presence of g^2 suggests a 2-loop process
- The 1/(4pi)^6 factor implies multiple integration scales, consistent with higher-order loops
- The (Q/M)^2 term indicates a relationship between energy scales typical of loop diagrams

4. Detailed Reasoning:
- The power structure and integration scale suggest a higher-order loop correction
- The scale of 1/(4pi)^6 is consistent with a 3-loop diagram
- The complexity of the power structure points most strongly to 3 loops

5. Elimination Process:
- 1 loop (option C) is too simple
- 2 loops (option B) doesn't match the complexity
- 6 loops (option A) seems excessive
- 3 loops (option D) best matches the mathematical structure
