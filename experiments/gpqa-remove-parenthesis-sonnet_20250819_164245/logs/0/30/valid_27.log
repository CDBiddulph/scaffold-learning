=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

   <ψ|σ_y|ψ> = (3i*, 4*) * [-4i]
                            [-3]

9) Calculating:
   = 3i*(-4i) + 4*(-3)
   = 12 - 12
   = 0

10) This indicates 12*hbar/25

Therefore, the answer is A.
