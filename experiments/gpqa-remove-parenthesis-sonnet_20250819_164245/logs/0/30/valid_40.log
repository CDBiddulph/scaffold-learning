=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:15:02,581 [INFO] LLM response end: ps:
   • Light speed in glass is 1/n
   • Glass is moving with velocity v
   • Final velocity accounts for both relativistic effects and medium's refractive index

Therefore, the answer is:
