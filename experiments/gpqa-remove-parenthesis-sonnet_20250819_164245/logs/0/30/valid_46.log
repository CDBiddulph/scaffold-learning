=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

7) Take the square root:
   R/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
           = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
           = √(24 / 662.9)
           = √(0.0362)
           = 0.19

8) This matches option B.
