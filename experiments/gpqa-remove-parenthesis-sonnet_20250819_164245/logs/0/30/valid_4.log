=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:16:21,146 [INFO] LLM response end:  survival to 50 minutes: exp(-0.00368 * 50) = 0.84

7) Probability of decay from 50 to 200 minutes:
   = 1 - exp(-0.00368 * 150)
   = 1 - 0.52
   = 0.48 (48%)

8) This matches option A, 48%
