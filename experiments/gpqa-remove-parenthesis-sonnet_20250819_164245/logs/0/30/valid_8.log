=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:15:16,686 [INFO] LLM response end: mall compared to 0.02, we can simplify:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / 0.02

7) Solving for x:
   x = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   x = √(1 × 10¹⁰)
   x = 1.0 × 10⁻²

8) This is the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.
