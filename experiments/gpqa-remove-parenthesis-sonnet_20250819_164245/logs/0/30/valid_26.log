=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:15:05,085 [INFO] LLM response end: A = 4πR^2
   A ≈ 4π × (10^6)^2 = 4π × 10^12

7) The entropy:
   S ≈ k × A / (4l_p^2)
   Where l_p ≈ 10^-35 meters

8) Calculating, this gives S ≈ 10^66 J/K

9) This corresponds to option B.
