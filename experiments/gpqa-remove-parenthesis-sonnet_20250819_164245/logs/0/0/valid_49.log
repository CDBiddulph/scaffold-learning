=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:44:44,261 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's look at the starting material, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one:
• This is a bicyclic ketone with a rigid, symmetrical structure

2) UV irradiation with the same molecular weight suggests a photochemical reaction:
• Most likely, this is a photochemical Norrish Type II reaction
• A hydrogen is abstracted from the adjacent carbon, forming a diradical that rearranges
• The product is likely a cyclic ketone with a different structural arrangement

3) Hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2 will reduce the ketone to an alcohol:
• This implies the product will have a hydroxyl group at the former ketone position

4) Consider the hydrogens in this final product:
• The most deshielded hydrogen will likely be the hydroxyl hydrogen
• Due to the rigid bicyclic structure, this proton will likely have constrained rotational motion
• The coupling will depend on the specific configuration of the hydroxyl group

5) With a rigid structure, the hydroxyl proton might show specific coupling:
• This suggests a doublet of doublets splitting pattern due to interactions with adjacent hydrogens
