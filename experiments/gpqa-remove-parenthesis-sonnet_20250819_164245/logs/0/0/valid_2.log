=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:39,038 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the problem:
• Starting material: Benzoic acid, 10 g
• Separated product: 4 g
• Separated starting material: 3 g

2) Calculate TLC spots:
• Starting material spot
• Product spot
• Solvent spot
This means A = three spots

3) Calculate percentage yield:
• Theoretical yield is the amount of product expected if the reaction went perfectly
• Product separated is 4 g
• Starting material remaining is 3 g

4) Total mass of product and starting material: 4 g + 3 g = 7 g
• Mass of starting material originally: 10 g

5) Percentage yield calculation:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100
• Theoretical yield = 10 g - 3 g = 7 g
• Percentage yield = (4 g / 7 g) × 100 = 55.55%

6) Checking the options:
• A = three spots ✓
• B = 55.55% ✓

Therefore, the answer is option A.
