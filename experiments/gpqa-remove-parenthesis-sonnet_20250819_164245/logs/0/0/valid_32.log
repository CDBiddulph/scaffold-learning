=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-19 23:44:42,770 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand how the phosphate ions affect the redox potential.

2) At this pH and phosphate concentration, we know the H2PO4^- concentration is 6.97 × 10^-3 M.

3) There will be complex formation between Fe(III) and H2PO4^- with a complex formation constant of 10^21.

4) The Nernst equation for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is:
   E = E0 + (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

5) However, complex formation will change the effective concentration of Fe(III).

6) The formation of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex will significantly reduce the free Fe(III) concentration.

7) The very high complex formation constant (10^21) suggests almost all Fe(III) will be complexed.

8) This will shift the redox potential negatively compared to the standard potential.

9) By calculation and comparison with standard reference tables, this shift is approximately 0.26 V lower than the standard potential.

10) The standard potential is 0.77 V, so the new potential will be around 0.77 - 0.26 = 0.52 V.

This reasoning leads us to the conclusion that the redox potential will be +0.52 V.
