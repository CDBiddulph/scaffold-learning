=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-19 23:44:42,517 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the probability of finding the particle at a distance r is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2, where Ψ(r) is the wave function.

2) We're told the wave function is spherically symmetric and real (imaginary part is zero).

3) Given: 
   - Inner sphere radius = d1
   - Outer sphere radius = 100*d1
   - Probability between d1 and 2*d1 is P
   - Probability between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P

4) For a spherically symmetric wave function, the probability depends on the volume element, which is 4πr^2 dr.

5) Probability = |Ψ(r)|^2 * 4πr^2 dr

6) Let's say Ψ(r) ∝ r^n, then |Ψ(r)|^2 ∝ r^(2n)

7) Probability = constant * r^(2n) * 4πr^2 dr = constant * r^(2n+2) dr

8) Comparing the probability between d1 and 2*d1 with 2*d1 and 3*d1:

   ∫(d1 to 2d1) r^(2n+2) dr = ∫(2d1 to 3d1) r^(2n+2) dr

9) These integrals are equal only if n = -3, which means Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r^3

10) This means Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r

Therefore, the wave function has the form 1/r.
