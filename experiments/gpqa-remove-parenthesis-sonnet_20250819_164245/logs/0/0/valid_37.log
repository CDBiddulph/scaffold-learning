=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's consider what forces are acting between these particles:
   • Gravitational attractive force
   • Electrostatic repulsive force (assuming like charges)

2) The gravitational force follows Newton's law: F_g = G(m1*m2)/r²
   Where G is the gravitational constant

3) The electrostatic force follows Coulomb's law: F_e = k(q1*q2)/r²
   Where k is Coulomb's constant

4) The distance is specified as 137 meters

5) The particles are described as having the smallest possible charge and mass:
   • This suggests we're dealing with fundamental particles like elementary particles
   • The fine structure constant (α ≈ 1/137) often emerges in quantum physics
   • This hints at a special relationship involving 137

6) The question asks for the ratio of repulsive force to attractive force strength

7) The key observation is that the distance (137 m) suggests a 1/137 relationship

8) This naturally points to the answer: 1/137

9) Let's verify: The ratio of electrostatic to gravitational force would indeed scale as 1/137
