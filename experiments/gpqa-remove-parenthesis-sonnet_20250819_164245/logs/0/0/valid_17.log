=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:45,219 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the 1H NMR data of the compounds:
• A (C6H13Br): 3 signals suggests a structured molecule with some symmetry
• B (C4H6): 3 signals suggests an unsymmetrical molecule with a triple bond
• C (C10H18): 5 signals suggests a more complex molecule with less symmetry

2. Molecular Formula Considerations:
• The reaction should combine the carbon atoms of A and B
• C10H18 suggests a carbon-carbon connection occurred

3. Type of Reaction:
• The problem mentions nucleophilic substitution or addition
• Since a carbon-carbon bond is formed, this suggests a coupling reaction

4. Detailed Molecular Structure:
• 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane is likely the reactant from A
• But-1-yne (CH3-CH2-C≡CH) appears to be the reactant from B

5. Product Formation:
• 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne matches the molecular formula C10H18
• It would result from a nucleophilic substitution reaction

6. Matching the Evidence:
• The description in option B matches our analysis
