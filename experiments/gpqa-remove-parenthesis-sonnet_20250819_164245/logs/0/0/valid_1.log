=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Half-life of Caesium-137:
• Cs-137 has a half-life of about 30 years (approximately 15.7 million minutes)
• After 80 minutes, the decay will be minimal, so we can assume full initial activity

2. Radioactive decay calculation:
• Number of atoms: 10^17
• Decay constant λ = ln(2) / Half-life
• Each decay emits a gamma ray

3. Average decay rate (activity):
• 1 decay per atom per mean lifetime
• Mean lifetime ≈ Half-life / ln(2)
• Activity ≈ (10^17) * (ln(2) / Half-life)

4. Solid angle calculation:
• Detector size: 2 x 3 cm = 6 cm²
• Distance: 4 meters = 400 cm
• Solid angle: (6 cm²) / (400 cm)² ≈ 1/2600 of total spherical radiation

5. Detected gamma rays:
• Total gamma rays ≈ (10^17) * (ln(2) / Half-life)
• Detected fraction: 1/2600
• Detected gamma rays ≈ 10^17 * (1/2600) ≈ 10^6

The calculation suggests approximately 1 million gamma rays.
