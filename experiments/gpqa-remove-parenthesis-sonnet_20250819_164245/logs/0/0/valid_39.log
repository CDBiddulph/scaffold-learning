=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

1. First, understand the context:
• PFA (paraformaldehyde) alone vs PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation
• ChIP-seq targeting IKAROS transcription factor
• Some peaks are "disappearing" with the additional crosslinking agent

2. Consider why peaks might disappear:
• Different crosslinking agents can alter protein-DNA interactions
• More stringent crosslinking (PFA+DSG) might disrupt weaker or more transient interactions

3. Think about where transcription factors typically bind:
• Active promoters and enhancers are dynamic regions
• These regions have open chromatin and frequent protein interactions
• Transcription factors like IKAROS often bind regulatory elements

4. Analyze the specific characteristics:
• Weak/transient interactions are most common at regulatory regions
• Regulatory regions involve rapid protein recruitment and displacement
• Such regions would be most sensitive to subtle changes in crosslinking

5. Conclusion:
The most likely location for disappearing peaks is at active promoters and enhancers, where protein interactions are dynamic and sensitive to crosslinking conditions.
