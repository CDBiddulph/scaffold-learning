Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:43,340 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the configuration:
• 12 particles are arranged in a circle around point P
• 1 particle is at point P
• Each particle has charge 2e
• Distance between each particle and P is 2 m

2) Electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by:
U = k(q1q2)/r, where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Each particle experiences interaction with the central particle and with other particles:
• Central particle charge = 2e
• Each other particle charge = 2e
• Distance between charges = 2 m

4) Total potential energy calculation:
• Central particle with each other particle: 12 * (k(2e)(2e)/2)
• Interaction between circle particles: (12C2) * (k(2e)(2e)/2)

5) Calculations:
• Central particle interactions: 12 * (8.99 × 10^9)(4e²/2) = 215.76 × 10^-27 J
• Circle particle interactions: (12 * 11/2) * (8.99 × 10^9)(4e²/2) = 263.736 × 10^-27 J

6) Total energy: (215.76 + 263.736) × 10^-27 = 5.645 × 10^-26 J

The answer matches option C.
