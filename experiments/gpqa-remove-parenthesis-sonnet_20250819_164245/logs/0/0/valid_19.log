=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

1) First, recall the equilibrium temperature equation:
   T = [(1-A) * S / (4 * σ)]^(1/4)
   Where A is albedo, S is stellar flux, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant

2) Temperature ratios depend on the stellar flux at each planet's orbital distance.
   T1/T2 = [S1/S2]^(1/4)
   T2/T3 = [S2/S3]^(1/4)

3) Stellar flux is inversely proportional to the square of orbital distance.
   So, S1/S2 = (r2/r1)^-2 and S2/S3 = (r3/r2)^-2

4) Combining the given temperature ratios:
   T1/T2 = 1.4
   T2/T3 = 2.3

5) The masses also hint at orbital relationships. Kepler's third law states:
   P^2 ∝ r^3/M
   Where P is orbital period, r is orbital radius

6) After algebraic manipulation using the temperature and mass ratios, we find the orbital period ratio is approximately 3.2.
