=== INPUT ===
Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

2025-08-19 23:44:41,518 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)):
- This is a Cope or Claisen rearrangement
- The terminal alkene shifts, creating a new ring
- Product is 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine

2) Second reaction ((3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat):
- This is a sigmatropic rearrangement
- The terminal alkynes will rearrange to form a cyclobutene derivative
- Product is (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane

3) Third reaction (2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat):
- Another sigmatropic rearrangement
- The rearrangement results in an aldehyde with a terminal methylene group
- Product is 4-methylenehexanal

Comparing these results with the given options, the description in option A matches all three transformations.
