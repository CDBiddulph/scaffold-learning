2025-08-19 23:44:45,859 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak wavelength/energy to temperature:
• Peak energy ∝ 1/Temperature

2) Star A's peak energy: 7.21 eV
• Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature relationship:
• T_A/T_sun = 1.41/7.21

4) We're also told the star is 24 times more luminous than the sun
• Luminosity L ∝ R²T⁴

5) Substituting temperature and luminosity:
• (R_A/R_sun)² * (T_A/T_sun)⁴ = 24

6) Let's calculate T_A/T_sun:
• T_A/T_sun = 1.41/7.21 = 0.196

7) Substituting into luminosity equation:
• (R_A/R_sun)² * (0.196)⁴ = 24

8) Solving for R_A/R_sun:
• (R_A/R_sun) = √(24 / (0.196)⁴)
• (R_A/R_sun) = 0.19

9) This matches option B.
