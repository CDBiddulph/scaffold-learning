=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:45,494 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the localization precision:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large uncertainty
• This suggests the objects are very far away
• The precision implies observations from a low Earth orbit satellite

2. Consider the distribution information:
• The objects have an isotropic (uniform in all directions) distribution
• This suggests a large-scale astronomical population

3. Evaluate the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
• These are extragalactic distances
• Consistent with isotropic distribution
• Would match the broad localization precision

B) 1-100 thousand light years
• This is within our galaxy
• Reasonable for astronomical observations
• Still consistent with the localization precision

C) 10-100 light years
• Too close to Earth
• Would be too precise for 100-200 arc minute localization
• Not consistent with isotropic distribution

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
• Far too close
• Within our solar system
• Not representative of astronomical objects

4. Conclusion:
Options A and B are most likely, but A (million/billion light years) best matches the description of an isotropic population with broad localization precision.
