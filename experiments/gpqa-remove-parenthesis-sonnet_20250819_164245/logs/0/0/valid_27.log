\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25

2025-08-19 23:44:42,242 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for expectation value:
   • <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ
   • Where ψ is the state vector, ψ† is its conjugate transpose, and σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix

2) The given state is (3i, 4)
   • ψ = [3i, 4]
   • ψ† = [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) Let's calculate ψ† * σ_y * ψ:
   • [-3i, 4] * [0 -i; i 0] * [3i; 4]
   = [-3i, 4] * [-4i; -3i]
   = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3i)
   = 12 - 12i

5) Simplify:
   • = 12 - 12i
   • = 12(1 - i)

6) The magnitude is 12*√2/2 = 12*hbar/25

7) Therefore, <S_y> = 12*hbar/25

8) This corresponds to option A.
