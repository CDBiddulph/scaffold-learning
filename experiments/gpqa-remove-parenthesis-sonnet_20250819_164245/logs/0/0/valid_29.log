=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:44:43,314 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Conditions for optically active saturated hydrocarbon:
• Must be a saturated hydrocarbon (contains only C and H, no double/triple bonds)
• Must have asymmetry/chirality center
• Requires at least 4 different substituents on a carbon atom

2. Checking molecular formulas by calculating molecular weights from m/z values:
A) Highest m/z = 72 → C5H12
B) Highest m/z = 86 → C6H14
C) Highest m/z = 58 → C4H10
D) Highest m/z = 100 → C7H16

3. Identifying chiral potential:
• C5H12 has 2,3-dimethylpentane (optically active) and other isomers
• C6H14 has multiple chiral isomers like 2,3-dimethylbutane
• C4H10 has no chiral centers
• C7H16 has multiple chiral isomers

4. Percentage composition matches molecular formulas

5. Identifying the chiral hydrocarbon:
Option B perfectly matches requirements for an optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
