=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:44,078 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to its power of loop integration.

2) Typically, each loop contributes an additional loop integration in the diagram's calculation, which means an additional factor of an integral over momentum.

3) The power of loop integration is often revealed by counting the power of relevant dimensionless factors in the diagram's amplitude.

4) While the specific diagram is unreadable, the coefficient gives us a clue: (1/(4π)^6

5) The power of (1/(4π)) here is 6, which suggests the number of loops.

6) Each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4π)^2 to the integral.

7) So 6 ÷ 2 = 3 loops would generate a factor of (1/(4π))^6

8) This suggests the Feynman diagram contains 3 loops.

9) Checking the available options, 3 loops corresponds to option D.
