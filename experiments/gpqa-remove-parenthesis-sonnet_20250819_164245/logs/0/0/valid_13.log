2025-08-19 23:44:41,957 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lorentz Symmetry:
• The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is fundamentally a quantum field theory
• It must respect Lorentz transformations, which describe how spacetime coordinates transform
• SMEFT operators MUST respect Lorentz symmetry
• ✓ This is a fundamental requirement

2. Poincaré Symmetry:
• Poincaré symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations and translations
• Since SMEFT is a relativistic field theory, it must respect Poincaré symmetry
• ✓ This is also a fundamental requirement

3. CP Symmetry:
• CP symmetry is not a mandatory requirement for SMEFT
• Some SMEFT operators might violate CP symmetry
• CP violation can be introduced as an effective parameter
• ✗ Not a mandatory symmetry

4. CPT Symmetry:
• CPT symmetry is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theories
• All relativistic quantum field theories must respect CPT symmetry
• ✓ This is a crucial requirement

Therefore, the symmetries that MUST be respected are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.
