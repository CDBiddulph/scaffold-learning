=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) The Mott-Gurney equation describes current flow in a semiconductor device under specific conditions:

2) Key requirements for the equation's validity:
• Single-carrier device: Only one type of charge carrier contributes to current
• Trap-free: No energy traps that can impede carrier movement
• Negligible carrier injection barrier
• Negligible diffusion current (current driven by concentration gradient)

3) Let's examine each option:

A) Specifies Ohmic contact, which isn't a primary requirement
• Contains "Ohmic contact"
• Mentions "trap-free single-carrier device"
• Mentions "negligible drift current"

B) Highlights "no carrier injection barrier"
• Mentions "trap-free single-carrier device"
• Specifies "negligible diffusion current"

C) Mentions Schottky contact, which typically implies a carrier injection barrier
• Schottky contact would NOT satisfy the equation's requirements

D) Specifies two-carrier device, which contradicts the single-carrier requirement

4) Option B most closely matches the fundamental requirements for the Mott-Gurney equation.
