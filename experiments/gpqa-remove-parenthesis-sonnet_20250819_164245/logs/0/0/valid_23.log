a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-19 23:44:43,282 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   m = M + 5 log(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs

2) Option A: A star with apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at 20 parsecs
   • This is already an apparent magnitude, so no conversion needed
   • Brightness: 7 mag

3) Option B: Two-star system with absolute magnitudes of 7 and 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   • For 10 parsecs, this will be the same as their apparent magnitudes
   • Combined magnitude will be brighter than 7 mag
   • Calculation: 2.512^(-Δmag) = 1 + 1 = 2
   • Resulting magnitude: 7 - 2.5 log(2) ≈ 6.25 mag

4) Option C: Two-star system with apparent magnitudes 7 and 8 at 5 parsecs
   • Combined magnitude will be brighter than individual magnitudes
   • Calculation similar to Option B will make it even brighter

5) Option D: Star with absolute magnitude of 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   • At 10 parsecs, absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude
   • Magnitude: 7 mag

Comparing these, Option C will be the brightest due to close stars and short distance.
