What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-19 23:44:41,985 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant (Kf) is given as 5x10¹⁰

3) We can write the equilibrium constant expression:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) We know the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M

5) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates:
   [Ca²⁺] = x
   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x
   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x

6) Substitute into the equilibrium constant expression:
   5x10¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)

7) Since Kf is very large, we can assume x is small compared to 0.02
   5x10¹⁰ = x² / 0.02
   x² = 5x10¹⁰ * 0.02
   x = √(5x10¹⁰ * 0.02)
   x = 1.0x10⁻² M

8) This matches option A.
