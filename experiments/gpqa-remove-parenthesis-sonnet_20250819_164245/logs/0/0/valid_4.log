=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, we know the decay probability within the first 100 minutes is 32%.

2) The key insight is to understand the remaining probability of decay after 50 minutes.

3) After 50 minutes (half the original 100-minute period), the atom has not decayed.

4) This means the probability of it surviving so far was 68% (1 - 32%).

5) We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given its survival so far.

6) This is a conditional probability problem. We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes.

7) Using conditional probability, we can calculate this as:
   P(decay in next 150 minutes | survived first 50) = 1 - P(no decay in next 150 minutes)

8) The original 100-minute decay probability was 32%.
   Scaling this to a 150-minute period would be proportionally higher.

9) (150/100) * 32% = 48%

10) 48% appears to be the probability of decay in the remaining time.
