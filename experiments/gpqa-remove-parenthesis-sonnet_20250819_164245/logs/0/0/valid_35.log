=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:42,923 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Analysis Findings:
- Strong interaction signal between promoter and enhancer
- Distance is ~1 Mb (megabase)
- Based on 50 million cells
- Statistically highly significant

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not confirm the interaction
- This suggests potential discrepancy in detection method

3. Additional Evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional interaction between the enhancer and promoter

4. Analyzing Possible Reasons:
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH: Unlikely, because Hi-C showed a highly significant signal
B) Structural variation affecting distance: Potentially valid, as structural variations could modify the expected linear distance
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH: Unlikely, as 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH
D) False-positive Hi-C signal: Possible, but the functional validation by dCas9-KRAB suggests a real interaction

5. Key Observation:
The functional impact of dCas9-KRAB suggests a genuine interaction, pointing towards a structural variation explanation.
