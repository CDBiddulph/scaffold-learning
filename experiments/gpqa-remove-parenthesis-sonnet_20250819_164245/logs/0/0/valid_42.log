=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:44,973 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Current Experimental Conditions
• The student has performed experiments at 300°C
• Achieved good reaction selectivity
• Tried different catalyst amounts and compositions
• Cannot increase conversion beyond current level

2. Considerations for Improving Conversion
• Temperature typically affects reaction kinetics
• Catalyst amount and composition influence reaction rates
• Need to avoid compromising selectivity

3. Analyzing the Options
• Option A suggests giving up - not a proactive scientific approach
• Option B suggests lowering temperature and increasing catalyst
   - Lower temperature might slow reaction rate
   - Increasing catalyst could help, but might not significantly improve conversion
• Option C (similar to B) adds awareness of potential polymerization
   - Important safety/scientific consideration
• Option D suggests increasing temperature and decreasing catalyst
   - Higher temperature usually increases reaction rates
   - Decreasing catalyst could reduce side reactions
   - Awareness of potential polymerization is crucial

4. Decision Making
• Temperature increase (option D) is more likely to improve conversion
• Reducing catalyst amount might help reduce unwanted side reactions
• Awareness of polymerization risk is scientifically responsible

5. Conclusion
Option D provides the most promising and scientifically sound approach.
