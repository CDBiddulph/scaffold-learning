=== INPUT ===
All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:44:44,261 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) This statement discusses the pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The statement appears to be scientifically sound and consistent with current research on viral genomic mechanisms.

B) This statement describes the function of nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. The description of their interaction in mismatch repair and preventing dsRNA breakdown seems accurate and aligns with current understanding of viral protein complexes.

C) This statement describes the mechanism of ORF3a in triggering apoptosis through caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic pathway. The explanation appears scientifically plausible and consistent with current research on SARS-CoV-2 protein functions.

D) This statement suggests that SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting has the same conformation as SARS-CoV. However, this is likely incorrect. Research has shown that while there are similarities, the frameshifting mechanisms and pseudoknot structures between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are not identical.

Specifically, studies have demonstrated subtle but significant differences in the pseudoknot structures and frameshifting efficiencies between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, statement D contains an inaccuracy.
