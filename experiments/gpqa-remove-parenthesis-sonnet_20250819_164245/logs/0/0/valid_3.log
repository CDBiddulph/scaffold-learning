1) First, let's recall the relationship between mass, radius, and density:
   • Density = Mass / Volume
   • Volume depends on the radius cubed

2) Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
   • By definition, this would have the same density as Earth
   • Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³

3) Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and density of 5.5 g/cm³:
   • This means the planet would be proportionally larger
   • The density remains constant

4) Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive:
   • If composition is the same, the density will remain constant
   • But the radius will increase
   • This implies a planet with 5x mass but a larger radius than Earth

5) Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass:
   • Composition is the same
   • Density depends on mass and volume
   • Halving the mass while keeping composition constant implies the radius would be smaller
   • This would actually increase the density

6) Comparing these, option d) would have the highest density.
