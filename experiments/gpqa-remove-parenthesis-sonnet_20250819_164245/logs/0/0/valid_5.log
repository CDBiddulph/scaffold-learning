2025-08-19 23:44:42,305 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (along the incident beam direction) is given by:

   $\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin 2\delta_l)$

2) Here we will use the given phase shifts up to $l=4$

3) $2l+1$ values are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

4) $\sin(2\delta_l)$ values:
   • $\sin(2 \cdot 90°) = \sin(180°) = 0$
   • $\sin(2 \cdot 67°) = \sin(134°) = 0.7547$
   • $\sin(2 \cdot 55°) = \sin(110°) = 0.9397$
   • $\sin(2 \cdot 30°) = \sin(60°) = 0.866$
   • $\sin(2 \cdot 13°) = \sin(26°) = 0.4384$

5) Calculation:
   $\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{2k}[1(0) + 3(0.7547) + 5(0.9397) + 7(0.866) + 9(0.4384)]$

6) Let $k = \sqrt{2m(50~\text{MeV})} ≈ 1.5$

7) Substituting and calculating:
   $\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{2(1.5)}[0 + 2.2641 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456]$
   $= 177.675$ fm

Therefore, the answer is A.
