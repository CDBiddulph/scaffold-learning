=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:42,079 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what we need:
- We want to clone the sequence into the expression vector
- We need to ensure directional cloning
- We need to match restriction sites that are compatible with the vector's multiple cloning site (MCS)

2. Analyze the vector's MCS:
- Contains: SmaI, HindIII, BglII, KpnI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI
- Possible enzyme combinations for directional cloning: HindIII and KpnI

3. Check the primers:
- Option A: Forward primer starts with HindIII site
- Reverse primer starts with KpnI site
- These match the compatible sites in the vector's MCS

4. Verify the sequence of inserted primers:
- The inserted sequence will start with ATG (start codon)
- The orientation will be correct for expression
- No additional bases beyond the restriction sites

5. Additional confirmation:
- The other primers do not match the vector's MCS sites as perfectly
- Option A provides the most straightforward cloning strategy

Therefore, the most suitable pair of primers is Option A.
