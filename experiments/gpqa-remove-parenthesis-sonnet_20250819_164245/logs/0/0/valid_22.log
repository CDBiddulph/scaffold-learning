=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:42,964 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the factors affecting para-substitution in electrophilic aromatic substitution:
• The substituent's electronic effect (directing ability)
• Steric hindrance
• Activating or deactivating nature of the substituent

2) Let's classify the substituents:
• Halogen (Cl) and nitro (NO2) groups are deactivating
• Alkyl groups (CH3, C2H5) are activating
• Carboxyl (COOH) and ester (COOC2H5) groups are weakly deactivating

3) Now, let's analyze the para-directing tendency:
• Alkyl groups (1, 5): Strong para directors
• Carboxyl/ester groups (2, 6): Moderate para directors
• Chloro group (3): Para director
• Nitro group (4): Strong meta director

4) Ranking from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:
• Nitro group (4) will have the lowest para yield
• Carboxylic/ester groups (2, 6) have moderate para yield
• Chloro (3) has decent para yield
• Alkyl groups (1, 5) have highest para yield

5) This leads to the ranking: 4 < 2/6 < 3 < 1/5

6) Checking the options, this matches option C.
