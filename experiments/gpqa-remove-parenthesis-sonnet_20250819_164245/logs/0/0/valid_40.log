=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:44:44,059 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the key elements of this problem:
   • Speed of light in vacuum (c) = 1
   • Index of refraction of glass = n
   • Velocity of glass = v
   • Direction of motion is toward the observer

2) We want to find the speed of light in the moving glass relative to the observer

3) This is a problem of relativistic velocity addition

4) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v/c²)
   Where:
   u = speed of light in glass
   v = velocity of glass
   u' = observed speed of light

5) In the glass, the speed of light is c/n (speed of light divided by refractive index)

6) Substituting u = c/n and c = 1:
   u' = ((c/n) + v) / (1 + ((c/n)*v))

7) Simplifying:
   u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)
      = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

8) This matches option D: (1+n*v)/(n+v)

9) Note this formula accounts for both the glass's motion and its refractive properties
