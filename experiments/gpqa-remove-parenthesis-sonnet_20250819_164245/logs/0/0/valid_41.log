1) First, recall that the color of light absorbed is complementary to the color of light emitted.

2) To determine the color of the emitted light, we need to convert the energy from eV to wavelength.

3) Using the equation E = hc/λ, where:
   • h = Planck's constant (4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s)
   • c = speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s)
   • E = 2.3393 eV

4) Rearranging the equation to solve for wavelength:
   λ = (hc)/E
   λ = (4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s)(3 × 10^8 m/s) ÷ (2.3393 eV)
   λ ≈ 530 nm

5) 530 nm falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

6) The complementary color to green is magenta/red.

7) Therefore, the color absorbed would be red.
