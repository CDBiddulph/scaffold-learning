=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:07,957 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Radioactive Decay Characteristics of Caesium-137
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
- Decays by beta emission, but also emits gamma rays
- Specific activity will depend on total number of atoms

2. Number of Atoms
- Total atoms: 10^17
- This is a significant number of radioactive atoms

3. Gamma Ray Emission Rate
- Each decay event typically produces gamma rays
- Decay constant (λ) and probability of gamma emission are key

4. Detector Parameters
- Detector size: 2 x 3 cm = 6 cm²
- Distance from source: 4 meters
- Solid angle of detection will be small due to distance

5. Calculating Detection Probability
- Gamma rays are emitted in all directions
- Detection probability depends on:
  * Total decay rate
  * Detector solid angle
  * Detector efficiency

6. Rough Estimation
- With 10^17 atoms, decay rate will be very high
- Over 80 minutes, multiple gamma rays will be emitted
- Order of magnitude likely around 10^6 gamma rays detected

Considering the given options and my systematic analysis, the most probable answer is the order of magnitude of 10^6.
