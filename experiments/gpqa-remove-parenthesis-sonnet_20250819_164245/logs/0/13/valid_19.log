=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-19 23:54:11,320 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the equilibrium temperature equation:
   T_eq = T_star * ((1-A)/(4R²))^(1/4)
   Where T_star is the star's temperature, A is albedo, R is orbital distance

2. Given data:
   - Temperature ratio (Planet1/Planet2) = 1.4
   - Temperature ratio (Planet2/Planet3) = 2.3
   - Mass ratio (Planet1/Planet2) = 1.15
   - Mass ratio (Planet2/Planet3) = 1.35
   - Albedo for all planets = 0.3

3. Using Kepler's Third Law: Period is proportional to (semi-major axis)³/√(total mass)

4. Temperature ratio implies distance ratio, so:
   R1/R2 ≈ (1.4)^4 = 3.8
   R2/R3 ≈ (2.3)^4 = 28.9

5. Combining distance and mass effects on orbital period:
   Period3/Period1 ≈ ((R3/R1)³)/√(M3/M1)

6. Calculating: (R3/R1) = (R2/R1) * (R3/R2) ≈ 3.8 * 28.9 = 109.8

7. Adjusting for mass ratio: √(M3/M1) ≈ √(1.15 * 1.35) ≈ 1.26

8. Final calculation: 109.8/1.26 ≈ 10.4
