=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:07,633 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) First, let's identify the fundamental forces at play:
• Electromagnetic force (repulsive/attractive between charges)
• Gravitational force (attractive)

2) Key contextual clues:
• Two point particles
• Separated by 137 meters
• "Smallest attainable charge and mass"

3) The fundamental forces have different strength relationships:
• Electromagnetic force follows Coulomb's law: F = k(q1*q2)/r²
• Gravitational force follows Newton's law: F = G(m1*m2)/r²

4) If we're talking about fundamental particles, this suggests electron/proton scale

5) At quantum scales, the interesting relationship is that electromagnetic force is ~10^36 times stronger than gravitational force

6) The specific distance of 137 meters and the 1/137 relationship suggests the fine structure constant (α ≈ 1/137), which is a fundamental quantum electrodynamics parameter

7) Checking the options, 1/137 stands out as matching the problem's characteristics

8) This suggests the repulsive force's strength is 1/137 of the attractive force's strength

Analysis suggests the most likely solution: a ratio of 1/137
