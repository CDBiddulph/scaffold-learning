2025-08-19 23:54:10,072 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's understand the system:
• We have a Ca-EDTA complex
• The concentration of the stoichiometric complex is 0.02 M
• The formation constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5 × 10^10
• Temperature is 25°C
• We need to find the calcium ion concentration

2. The equilibrium reaction can be written as:
Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

3. The formation constant (K) is defined as:
K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4. Rearranging the equation:
[Ca²⁺] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5. For a 1:1 complex, initial [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M
Let x = [Ca²⁺] at equilibrium

6. Substituting into the formation constant equation:
5 × 10^10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

7. Solving this equation (approximating if x is small):
x = √(5 × 10^10 × 0.02)
x ≈ 6.3 × 10^-7 M

8. Checking the options, this matches option B.
