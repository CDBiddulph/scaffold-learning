=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:09,505 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Data Analysis
- Detected significant interaction between an active promoter and active enhancer
- Linear distance of ~1 Mb between the regions
- Based on 50 million cells, suggesting statistical robustness

2. FISH Validation Attempt
- Failed to confirm the Hi-C interaction
- This suggests potential discrepancy in interaction detection method

3. Additional Evidence
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This implies a functional connection between the enhancer and promoter

4. Analyzing Possible Reasons
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH detection
- FISH is typically less sensitive than Hi-C
- A weak interaction might be missed by FISH
- The modest gene expression reduction (20%) suggests a subtle interaction

B) Structural variation might affect linear distance
- Less likely, as 1 Mb is not an extreme distance for chromosomal interactions

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH
- Not applicable, as 1 Mb is a detectable distance for FISH

D) False-positive Hi-C signal
- Less likely given the functional validation by dCas9-KRAB experiment

5. Conclusion
The most probable explanation is the low interaction frequency, making it challenging to detect by FISH.
