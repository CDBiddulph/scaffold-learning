=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:10,576 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Multi-Higgs-Doublet Models (MHDM):
- These are extensions of the Standard Model with multiple Higgs doublets
- They provide potential insights into new physics beyond the Standard Model
- The complexity of interactions requires precise parameter analysis

2. Oblique Parameters:
- These are quantum corrections that characterize electroweak precision tests
- Originally introduced by Peskin and Tellmann to parametrize new physics effects
- Sensitive to quantum loop corrections in electroweak interactions

3. Breit-Wigner Corrections:
- Describe resonance line shapes in particle physics
- Account for finite width effects in particle interactions
- Can provide more nuanced description of quantum corrections

4. Detailed Analysis:
- Breit-Wigner corrections can refine the precision of Oblique Parameters
- They capture additional quantum mechanical interference effects
- Particularly important when dealing with charged scalar particles in multi-Higgs models

5. Constraint Implications:
- The corrections can potentially provide more stringent constraints on new physics
- Depends sensitively on specific model parameters and scalar masses

6. Evaluation of Options:
- Option C suggests mass-dependent effects, which is most consistent with theoretical expectations
- The precision depends on specific scalar sector characteristics
