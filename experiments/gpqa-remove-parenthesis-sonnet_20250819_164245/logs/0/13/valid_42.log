=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:11,535 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Temperature and Catalyst Impact Analysis:
- Generally, temperature affects reaction kinetics and thermodynamics
- Catalyst amount influences reaction rate and efficiency
- Polymerization is a potential side reaction to be cautious about

2. Detailed Option Analysis:
A) Giving up without trying further optimization is not scientific best practice

B) Decreasing temperature typically:
- Slows reaction rate
- Can improve selectivity
- Potential positive for conversion
- Adding more catalyst might compensate for slower kinetics
- No mention of polymerization risk

C) Similar to Option B, but explicitly acknowledges polymerization risk
- Shows awareness of potential side reactions
- Demonstrates more sophisticated scientific approach
- Proactive about potential complications
- More comprehensive problem-solving strategy

D) Increasing temperature typically:
- Accelerates reaction rate
- Can reduce conversion in some cases
- Decreasing catalyst contradicts improving conversion
- Polymerization risk at higher temperatures is significant

3. Reasoning Conclusion:
Option C provides the most scientifically rigorous approach:
- Systematic experimental strategy
- Temperature optimization
- Catalyst adjustment
- Explicit awareness of potential side reactions
