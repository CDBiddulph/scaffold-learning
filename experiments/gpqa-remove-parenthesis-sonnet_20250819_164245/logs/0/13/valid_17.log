=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:09,551 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas:
- Compound A (C6H13Br): 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane
- Compound B (C4H6): but-1-yne
- Product C (C10H18): 8-carbon chain with 2 methyl groups and a triple bond

2. NMR Signal Analysis:
- A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests a branched alkyl halide
- B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) indicates an unsymmetrical alkyne
- C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests a complex hydrocarbon

3. Reaction Type:
- This involves an alkyl halide and an alkyne
- Suggests a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction
- Alkyne acts as a nucleophile, displacing bromide

4. Product Structure:
- 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne matches the molecular formula and NMR data

5. Comparing Options:
- Option B matches all the characteristics we've analyzed
