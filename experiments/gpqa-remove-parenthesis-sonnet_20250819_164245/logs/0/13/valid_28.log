=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:10,912 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Analyze key terms in the passage about Wnt3a signaling pathway:
- Wnt3a is a secreted glycoprotein ligand
- Frizzled is the transmembrane receptor protein
- LRP5/6 is a co-receptor
- Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this pathway
- Translocation to nucleus occurs
- Intracellular calcium is released
- Destruction complex targets Beta-catenin
- Proteasomal degradation happens without ligand binding

2. Evaluate Option A: 
- "Translocation into nucleus" ✓ Correct
- "Intracellular calcium" ✓ Correct
- "Destruction complex" ✓ Correct
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct
Option A contains all correct terms

3. Evaluate Option B:
- "Proteasomal degradation" ✓ Correct
- "N-terminal extracellular" ✓ Correct
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct
- "Non-canonical" ✓ Correct
Option B also contains all correct terms

4. Evaluate Option C:
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct
- "Directly binds DNA" ✓ Correct
- "LRP5/6" ✓ Correct
- "Transmembrane receptor protein" ✓ Correct
Option C also contains all correct terms

5. Evaluate Option D:
- "Transcriptional co-activator" ✓ Correct
- "Glycoprotein" ✓ Correct
- "Accumulation in cytoplasm" ✓ Correct
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct
Option D also contains all correct terms

6. Since multiple options contain correct terms, I'll look for the most comprehensive option that precisely matches the passage.

After careful analysis, Option A seems the most precisely aligned with the passage's description of the Wnt3a signaling pathway.
