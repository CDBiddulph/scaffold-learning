=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:08,602 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution, particularly the para-directing ability:

1) First, let's categorize the substituents:
- Electron-donating groups (EDG): C6H5-CH3, C6H5-C2H5, C6H5-COOC2H5
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG): C6H5-NO2, C6H5-COOH, C6H5-Cl

2) Para-directing capability depends on electron density:
- Strong EDGs strongly favor para substitution
- Moderate EDGs moderately favor para substitution
- EWGs typically reduce para substitution

3) Analyzing each substituent's para-directing strength:
- CH3 (methyl): Strong EDG, high para yield
- COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Moderate EDG, moderate para yield
- Cl (chloro): Weak EWG, low para yield
- NO2 (nitro): Strong EWG, very low para yield
- C2H5 (ethyl): Moderate EDG, moderate para yield
- COOH (carboxylic acid): Strong EWG, very low para yield

4) Ordering from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:
NO2 < COOH < Cl < COOC2H5 < CH3 < C2H5

5) This matches option B: 4<6<2<1<5<3
