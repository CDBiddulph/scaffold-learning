Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:54:08,332 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Requirements for an optically active saturated hydrocarbon:
- Must have asymmetric carbon (chiral carbon)
- Contains only carbon and hydrogen
- All carbon-carbon bonds are single bonds (saturated)
- Different substituent groups around the chiral carbon

2. Analyzing the composition percentages:
- Typical formula for saturated hydrocarbons: CnH2n+2
- Need to check which composition fits this formula

3. Calculate molecular composition for each option:
A) C 83.33%, H 16.66%
   Ratio suggests approximately C5H10
   Contains possible symmetry → likely NOT optically active

B) C 83.72%, H 16.27%
   Ratio suggests C6H12
   Potential for asymmetric carbon
   Could have chiral configuration

C) C 82.75%, H 17.25%
   Ratio suggests C5H10
   Contains possible symmetry → likely NOT optically active

D) C 84%, H 16%
   Ratio suggests C7H14
   Broad range, less specific

4. Most promising option is B, which suggests a configuration with potential optical activity.
