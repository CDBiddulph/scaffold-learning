=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:07,331 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this methodically:

1. The key to identifying the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is to analyze the power of certain loop-related factors in the mathematical expression.

2. In quantum field theory, the number of loops is typically related to the complexity of the diagram and the power of certain dimensionless coupling constants.

3. The key part of the expression that suggests the number of loops is typically the term 1/(4π)^6

4. Let's break down the possible loop numbers:
   - 1 loop: Would result in 1/(4π)^2
   - 2 loops: Would result in 1/(4π)^4
   - 3 loops: Would result in 1/(4π)^6 ✓
   - 6 loops: Would result in 1/(4π)^12

5. In this case, 1/(4π)^6 suggests 3 loops, which corresponds perfectly to the power in the expression.

6. The other factors like α^3, g^2, etc. are additional coupling constants and do not directly indicate the loop number.

7. By the systematic evidence in the expression, the most likely number of loops is 3.
