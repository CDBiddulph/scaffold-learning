=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:09,655 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Restriction enzyme sites in the vector's Multiple Cloning Site (MCS):
- HindIII
- KpnI
- BamHI

2. Key requirements for PCR primers:
- Must allow directional cloning
- Must introduce appropriate restriction sites for cloning
- First primer should include start codon (ATG)
- Need complementary restriction sites

3. Analyzing the provided primers:

Primer 1 (Forward):
- All options start with the correct ATG start codon
- Capitalize the restriction enzyme site prefix

Primer 2 (Reverse):
- Need to complement the last part of the sequence
- Must have a compatible restriction site for directional cloning

4. Best choice analysis:
- Option D uses BamHI (in MCS) and HindIII (in MCS)
- Primer 1: aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG (introduces BamHI site)
- Primer 2: aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG (introduces HindIII site)
- These sites will allow precise, directional cloning into the expression vector

5. Verification:
- Start codon present ✓
- Restriction sites match vector's MCS ✓
- Allows correct orientation ✓
