=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:08,263 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Localization Precision Analysis
- Satellites detected objects with precision of 100-200 arc minutes
- This suggests a wide, imprecise detection range
- Implies the objects are likely at significant distances

2. Distribution Characteristics
- The distribution is described as "isotropic" (uniform in all directions)
- This suggests astronomical, not local/terrestrial objects
- Implies objects are likely at stellar or galactic scales

3. Distance Option Evaluation
A) 1 million/1 billion light years: 
- Extremely large cosmic distances
- Consistent with galactic/extragalactic scales
- Detection precision matches this scale ✓

B) 1-100 thousand light years:
- Typical galactic distances
- Within Milky Way scale
- Reasonable detection precision ✓

C) 10-100 light years:
- Very local stellar neighborhood
- Too small for imprecise detection methods
- Inconsistent with localization range ✗

D) 10 light minutes/100 light seconds:
- Extremely close, solar system scale
- Far too small for described detection method ✗

4. Conclusion
The most scientifically consistent options are A and B.
However, the question asks for a single answer.
