=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:54:08,914 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting Material Analysis:
- bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a bridged bicyclic ketone
- It has a symmetrical, rigid cage-like structure

2. UV Irradiation (Product 1):
- UV radiation can induce photochemical reactions
- In this case, likely causes photochemical rearrangement
- The molecular weight remains unchanged, suggesting structural rearrangement
- Probable [2+2] cycloaddition or ring-opening/closing reaction

3. Palladium/Hydrogen Reduction (Product 2):
- Pd/H2 typically reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols or alkyl groups
- Given the molecular framework, this likely reduces the ketone to a saturated alcohol

4. NMR Considerations:
- The most deshielded hydrogen will be the one closest to the former carbonyl site
- In a saturated alcohol, this hydrogen will likely have neighboring hydrogens
- This suggests a splitting pattern based on neighboring hydrogens

5. Splitting Pattern Analysis:
- Neighboring hydrogens will cause splitting
- Specific environment suggests a doublet of doublets pattern

The key reasoning points to a doublet of doublets for the most deshielded hydrogen.
