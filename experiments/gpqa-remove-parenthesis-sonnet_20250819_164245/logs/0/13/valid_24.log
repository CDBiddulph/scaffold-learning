Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:11,093 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle type in 1e-5 seconds

2. Distance calculation uses the formula: Distance = Speed × Time
   • Time is constant: 1e-5 seconds
   • Need to calculate distance for each particle type based on their relativistic speed

3. Calculations:
   • Zeta (0.96c): 
     Distance = 0.96 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 28,800 meters
     Beyond ground level (13,000m) ✓ All particles reach ground

   • Eta (0.9c):
     Distance = 0.9 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 27,000 meters
     Beyond ground level ✓ All particles reach ground

   • Chi (0.88c):
     Distance = 0.88 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 26,400 meters
     Beyond ground level ✓ All particles reach ground

   • Lambda (0.93c):
     Distance = 0.93 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 27,900 meters
     Beyond ground level ✓ All particles reach ground

4. Ordering by particle count:
   Zeta: 30,000 particles
   Lambda: 24,000 particles
   Eta: 20,000 particles
   Chi: 19,000 particles

5. Comparing order of particle count with those reaching ground:
   Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi
