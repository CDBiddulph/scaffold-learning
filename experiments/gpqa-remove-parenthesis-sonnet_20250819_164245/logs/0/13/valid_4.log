=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:08,395 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using probability theory and radioactive decay principles:

1. First, understand the given information:
• Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay
• We want to calculate decay probability for next 150 minutes

2. This scenario follows exponential decay probability
• The decay probability depends on remaining time
• Previous non-decay is key information

3. Calculate conditional probability:
• P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes)
• This uses the "memoryless" property of radioactive decay
• Remaining probability is calculated from original distribution

4. Mathematical approach:
• Original probability of decay in 100 minutes = 32%
• Probability of NO decay in 100 minutes = 68%
• We've already passed 50 minutes without decay

5. Probability calculation:
• Remaining decay probability = 1 - (Probability of NO decay)
• Remaining decay probability = 1 - (68%)
• Calculation points to around 52% probability

6. Checking the options:
• 52% matches option C
