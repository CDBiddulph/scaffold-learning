2025-08-19 23:54:11,517 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key relationships for black hole entropy:
- Black hole entropy is related to the event horizon's area
- This is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula: S = kA/4ℓ²p
  Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the horizon area, and ℓp is the Planck length

2) Calculate the black hole's radius from the angular size:
- θ = 10^-17 degrees
- At distance d = 10^10 parsecs
- Radius = θ * d * (π/180°)
- R ≈ 10^-17 * 10^10 * (π/180) parsecs
- R ≈ 10^-7 parsecs

3) Convert parsecs to meters:
- 1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
- R ≈ 10^-7 * 3 * 10^16 meters
- R ≈ 10^10 meters

4) Calculate horizon area:
- A = 4πR²
- A ≈ 4π * (10^10)²
- A ≈ 10^22 m²

5) Using Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:
- S ≈ (k/4ℓp²) * A
- Suggests entropy around 10^66 J/K
