2025-08-19 23:54:09,509 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law:

1) First, recall the relevant relationships:
• Peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature
• Luminosity is proportional to radius squared and temperature to the fourth power

2) Calculate temperature ratio using Wien's displacement law:
• Star A peak energy = 7.21 eV
• Sun's peak energy = 1.41 eV
• Temperature ratio = (7.21/1.41) = 5.11

3) Luminosity comparison:
• Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun
• Luminosity = R²T⁴
• 24 = (R/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴

4) Solve for radius:
• (R/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
• (R/R_sun)² = 24 / 672.24
• R/R_sun = √(24/672.24)
• R/R_sun ≈ 0.19

5) Check the given options and select the closest match.
