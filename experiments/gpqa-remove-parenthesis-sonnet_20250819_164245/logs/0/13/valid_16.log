=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:08,309 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing process:
- CRISPR-Cas9 uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence
- The goal is to create a precise DNA cut and potentially insert new genetic material

2. Examining Option A:
- mRNA does not typically integrate directly into the genome
- Messenger RNA is usually translated into protein, not incorporated as DNA
- This makes Option A scientifically unlikely

3. Examining Option B:
- Guide RNA-donor DNA complexes can potentially be incorporated into the genome
- This could explain genetic mosaicism during embryo development
- The process could lead to different genomic regions having different genetic compositions
- This mechanism is scientifically plausible

4. Examining Option C:
- Accidental incorporation of surrogate mother's DNA is highly improbable
- CRISPR-Cas9 is a precise editing technique targeting specific sequences
- Random DNA incorporation from another organism is not a typical mechanism

5. Examining Option D:
- Continuous DNA cutting could cause genomic instability
- While possible, this seems less likely than controlled integration

6. Reasoning conclusion:
- Option B provides the most scientifically sound explanation for different genomes in a transgenic animal
