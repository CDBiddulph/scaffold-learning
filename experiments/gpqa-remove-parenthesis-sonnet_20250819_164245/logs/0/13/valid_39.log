=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-19 23:54:09,859 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental setup:
- ChIP-seq was performed with an antibody against IKAROS transcription factor
- Two fixation methods were used: PFA alone and PFA+DSG
- Peaks disappeared when DSG was added to PFA

2. Significance of fixation methods:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) is a standard crosslinking agent that captures protein-DNA interactions
- DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is a more stringent, longer-range crosslinker
- Disappearing peaks suggest protein-DNA interactions disrupted by more extensive crosslinking

3. Characteristics of disappearing peaks:
- Likely represent weak or transient protein-DNA interactions
- Would be found at regions with dynamic chromatin interactions

4. Most likely location:
- Active promoters and enhancers are known for dynamic, transient transcription factor binding
- These regions have frequent protein turnover and flexible chromatin states
- Transcription factors like IKAROS often have rapid binding/unbinding kinetics at regulatory elements

5. Ruling out other options:
- Random locations (A) - Unlikely
- Repeats (B) - Less likely to have specific transcription factor binding
- Introns of large genes (C) - Not typical sites of dynamic transcription factor interactions
