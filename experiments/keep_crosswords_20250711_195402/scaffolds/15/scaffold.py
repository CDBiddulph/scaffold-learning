Solve this crossword puzzle completely and accurately.

{input_string}

Please provide your solution in the exact same format as the input:
1. The completed grid with all letters filled in (replace dashes with letters, keep periods as black squares)
2. The Across section with all answers
3. The Down section with all answers

Be very careful to ensure:
- All letters are correct and consistent between intersecting words
- The grid structure matches exactly
- All clue numbers have corresponding answers
- Letters are in ALL CAPS

Format your response exactly like the input but with the grid filled in and answers provided.
