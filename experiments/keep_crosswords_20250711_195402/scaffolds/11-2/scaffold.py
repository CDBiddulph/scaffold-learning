    # constraints like intersecting letters. Then format the output to match

        prompt = f"""You are a crossword puzzle solver. Please solve this crossword puzzle completely.

The input contains a grid (where - represents empty squares and . represents black squares) followed by clues.

Please provide the complete solution in this EXACT format:
1. First, the filled grid with letters and . for black squares
2. Then a blank line
3. Then "Across:" followed by all across answers
4. Then a blank line  
5. Then "Down:" followed by all down answers

Here is the puzzle to solve:

{input_string}

Important rules:
- Use only uppercase letters in the grid and answers
- Make sure intersecting letters match between across and down words
- Black squares should remain as .
- Each answer should be on its own line with the number and period
- Do not include the original clues, only the answers
