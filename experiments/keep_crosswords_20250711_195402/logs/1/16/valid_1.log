1. Grid Dimensions: 15 rows x 15 columns

2. Across Clues: 71 (from 1 to 71)

3. Down Clues: Appears to be a matching number, likely also 71 clues

4. Grid Structure Patterns:
- Symmetrical black square layout (rotational symmetry)
- Relatively sparse black square distribution
- Multiple areas of interconnected white squares
- Some isolated sections that may require careful solving
- Black squares create interesting diagonal and clustered patterns
- Several longer potential theme entries (given hints about circled letters)

The grid looks like a standard American-style crossword puzzle with a clean, balanced design that allows for multiple entry points and solving paths.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these observations?
