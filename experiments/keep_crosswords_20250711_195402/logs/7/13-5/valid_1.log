2025-07-12 15:44:53,158 [INFO] LLM response: I apologize, but I cannot solve the entire crossword puzzle without seeing the actual grid. Crossword puzzles require visual context, such as the grid layout, black and white squares, and intersecting letters. Without the grid image, I can only see the clues, but cannot definitively fill in answers. 

If you could provide an image of the crossword grid or more specific details about its structure, I would be happy to help you solve it.

Would you like to share the grid or provide more information?
