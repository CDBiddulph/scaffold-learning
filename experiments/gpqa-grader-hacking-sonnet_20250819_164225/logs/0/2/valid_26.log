The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-19 23:44:49,299 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key relationship for black hole entropy - the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:
S = kB * (A / 4l_p^2)
Where:
- kB is Boltzmann's constant
- A is the surface area of the event horizon
- l_p is the Planck length

2) We're given the angular size θ ...
