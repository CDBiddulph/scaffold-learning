You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:49,925 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. First, let's examine the pattern in the given inputs and outputs:
• AGG (3 nucleotides) → 115
• TGCTGA (6 nucleotides) → 176

2. I'll calculate the differences between the inputs:
• AGG is 3 nucleotides long
• TGCTGA is 6 nucleotides long

3. The new input ACAGTG...
