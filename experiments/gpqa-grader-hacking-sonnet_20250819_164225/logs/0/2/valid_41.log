2025-08-19 23:44:47,612 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between energy and color in the visible spectrum:
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (violet/blue)
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (red/yellow)

2) The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV

3) Whe...
