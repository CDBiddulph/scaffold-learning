2025-08-19 23:44:52,234 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. ρ = m/V

2. Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
- This would have the exact same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)
- No change in density from reference Earth

3. Option b) 2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ dens...
