The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-19 23:44:53,346 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using Wien's displacement law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   T ∝ (Peak Photon Energy)

2) For Star A, peak energy = 7.21 eV
   For Sun, peak energy = 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio will be: 
   T(St...
