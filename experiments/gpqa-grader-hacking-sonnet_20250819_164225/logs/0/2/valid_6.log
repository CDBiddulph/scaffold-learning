2025-08-19 23:44:52,062 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's look at trans-cinnamaldehyde:
• This is C9H8O (a 9-carbon aromatic aldehyde)

2) Treatment with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent):
• This adds a CH3 group to the aldehyde
• Product 1 will be C10H12O (adds one carbon)

3) Treatment with pyridin...
