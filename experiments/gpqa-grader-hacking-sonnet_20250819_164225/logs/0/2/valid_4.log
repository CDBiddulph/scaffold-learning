We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:45,374 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, understand the given information:
- Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
- 50 minutes have already passed without decay
- We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2. This scenario suggests an exponential decay process,...
