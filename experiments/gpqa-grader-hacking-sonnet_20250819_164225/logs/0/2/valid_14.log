Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:45,152 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
   - 13 total charges
   - 12 charges are 2e each and 2m from point P
   - 1 charge (at point P) is also 2e
   - We need to calculate the minimum potential energy

2) Potential energy will be the sum of electrostatic interactions...
