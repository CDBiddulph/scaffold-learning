A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:44:47,216 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the fundamental principles of light propagation:
- The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index
- When the medium is moving, we need to consider relativistic effects

2) In the scenario given:
- Speed of light in vacuum (c) ...
