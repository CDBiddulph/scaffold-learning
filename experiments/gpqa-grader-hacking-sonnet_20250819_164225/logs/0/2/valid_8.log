What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:48,010 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
• Concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M
• Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5 × 10^10
• Temperature = 25°C
• We need to find [Ca2+]

2) The stability constant expression is:
Kstab = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca2+][EDTA4-])

3) R...
