Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:45,682 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the forces involved:
• The attractive force is likely gravitational
• The repulsive force is likely electrostatic (Coulomb force)

2) Gravitational force follows Newton's law: F_g = G(m1*m2)/r^2
• Where G is gravitational constant
• Mass and r...
