a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.

2025-08-19 23:48:41,677 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus formula:
   m = M + 5 log(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs

2) For option A:
   • Apparent magnitude = 7 mag
   • Distance = 20 parsecs
   • Already given as apparent magnitude

3) For option B:
   • For a two-star system with same absolute magnitudes at 10 parsecs
   • Each star's absolute magnitude = 7
   • Using distance modulus, their apparent magnitude will also be 7
   • Combined brightness of the two stars will be brighter than a single star of apparent magnitude 7

4) For option C:
   • One star at 7 mag, another at 8 mag
   • Both at 5 parsecs
   • Combined brightness will be brighter than a single star

5) For option D:
   • Star with absolute magnitude of 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   • By definition, this means its apparent magnitude is also 7 mag

6) Comparing the options:
   • Option B will have two stars at 7 mag
   • Option C will have two stars at different magnitudes but closer
   • Option C will appear brightest

Answer: C
