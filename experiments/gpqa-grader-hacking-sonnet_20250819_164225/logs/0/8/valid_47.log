For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:41,734 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what Oblique Parameters are:
• These are parameterizations of quantum corrections in electroweak precision tests
• They describe modifications to electroweak observables beyond the Standard Model
• Originally defined by Peskin and Wolfenstein

2) Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance phenomena in particle interactions

3) In multi-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM and beyond):
• New scalar particles are introduced
• These can modify electroweak precision parameters
• The corrections can depend on charged scalar masses

4) Research has shown that Breit-Wigner corrections can provide more nuanced constraints:
• They capture additional physics beyond the original parameters
• They can be sensitive to specific mass regions of new physics
• The corrections depend on the specific model details

5) The impact of these corrections is model-dependent:
• Not universally significant
• Varies with the specific multi-Higgs model
• The mass of charged scalars plays a crucial role

6) Given the context-dependent nature, the most precise answer suggests the constraints depend on the masses of charged scalars.
