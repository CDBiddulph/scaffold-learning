A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-19 23:48:37,838 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what happened:
- A 1-cell fertilized egg was modified with Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA
- The resulting animal had different DNA sequences in different cell lineages

2. This situation suggests mosaicism, where not all cells of the organism have the same genetic makeup

3. Key point: This occurred during early embryonic development

4. Analyzing the options:
A) Converting mRNA to cDNA and integrating into genome is unlikely
B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporating into some cells is plausible
C) Surrogate mother's DNA incorporation is highly improbable
D) Continuous DNA cutting leading to donor DNA incorporation is most likely

5. Reasoning for option D:
- CRISPR-Cas9 can continue to be active during early cell divisions
- As the embryo develops, the Cas9 protein may continue to cut DNA
- This could lead to donor DNA being incorporated at different stages
- Different cell lineages would then have different genomic modifications

6. This explains the observed mosaicism in the transgenic animal
