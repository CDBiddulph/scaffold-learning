2025-08-19 23:48:39,619 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand density. Density is mass divided by volume. For a spherical planet, density depends on mass and radius.

2) Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet will have the exact same density as Earth, approximately 5.5 g/cm³.

3) Option b: This option specifies a density of 5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as Earth's density.

4) Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive
• If mass increases 5 times but composition stays the same, radius will also increase
• The density would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm³

5) Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass
• If mass decreases, volume would decrease less proportionally
• This would actually result in a HIGHER density

6) Comparing the densities:
• Options a, b, and c all have 5.5 g/cm³
• Option d would have a density higher than 5.5 g/cm³

7) Therefore, option d has the highest density.
