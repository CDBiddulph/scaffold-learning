2025-08-19 23:48:41,729 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the formula for the angular size of a black hole's event horizon:
   θ = 2Rs / d
   where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius and d is the distance

2) We know:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Convert degrees to radians:
   θ (radians) = θ (degrees) * (π/180°)
   θ = 10^-17 * (π/180) ≈ 10^-19 radians

4) Rearrange the angular size formula to find Rs:
   Rs = (θ * d) / 2

5) Calculate Rs:
   Rs ≈ (10^-19 * 10^10 * 3 * 10^16) / 2
       ≈ 10^7 meters

6) The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area:
   S ∝ (Rs)^2

7) Calculate the entropy:
   S ∝ (10^7)^2 = 10^14 * 10^48 = 10^62 J/K

8) Comparing with the given options, this matches option C.
