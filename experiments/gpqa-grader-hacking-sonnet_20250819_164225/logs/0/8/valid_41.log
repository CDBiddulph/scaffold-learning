2025-08-19 23:48:40,816 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between energy and color of light
• Energy is inversely related to wavelength
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (higher frequency) colors
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (lower frequency) colors

2) The energy given is 2.3393 eV
• This is a moderate energy value

3) Let's consider the visible light spectrum from high to low energy:
• Violet: ~3.1 eV
• Blue: ~2.7 eV
• Green: ~2.4 eV
• Yellow: ~2.1 eV
• Red: ~1.8 eV

4) The emission energy of 2.3393 eV is close to green

5) When a substance emits light of a certain color, it typically absorbs the complementary (opposite) color

6) The complementary color to green is red

7) Therefore, the textile dye with this conjugated pi-electron system likely absorbs red light

8) Following the reasoning above, red light would be the color absorbed by this organic compound
