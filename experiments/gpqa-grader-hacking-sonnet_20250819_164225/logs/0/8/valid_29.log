Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:48:41,910 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Optically active compounds require:
• An asymmetric carbon center (chiral center)
• At least one carbon with 4 different substituents

2) This means we need to look for a molecule with an odd number of carbons that allows asymmetry

3) Let's analyze the molecular formulas based on mass spectral data:
• A: m/z = 72 suggests C5H12
• B: m/z = 86 suggests C6H14
• C: m/z = 58 suggests C4H10
• D: m/z = 100 suggests C7H16

4) For optically active potential:
• C5H12 can have 2-methylbutane (chiral)
• C6H14 can have 2-methylpentane or 3-methylpentane (chiral)
• C4H10 is symmetric (2-methylpropane)
• C7H16 can have multiple chiral configurations

5) Let's look at compositions:
• A: 5 carbons, consistent with C5H12
• B: 6 carbons, consistent with C6H14
• C: 4 carbons, consistent with C4H10
• D: 7 carbons, consistent with C7H16

6) Option B allows for chirality and has the correct molecular characteristics

Answer: B
