ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-19 23:48:41,671 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the context:
- ChIP-seq with PFA alone produced peaks for IKAROS
- The same peaks disappeared when PFA+DSG (double crosslinking) was used

2. Consider what crosslinking changes:
- DSG is a protein-protein crosslinker
- It helps stabilize protein complexes and interactions
- Its addition might prevent detecting certain types of interactions

3. Where would crosslinking most likely interfere?
- Regions with weak/transient protein interactions
- Sites with dynamic chromatin configuration
- Areas with multiple protein complexes

4. In the context of transcription factor binding:
- Weak/dynamic interactions typically occur at:
  - Active regulatory elements
  - Promoters and enhancers
  - Sites of active transcriptional regulation

5. Characteristics of active promoters/enhancers:
- High protein mobility
- Multiple protein complexes
- Frequent chromatin remodeling
- Sensitive to additional crosslinking

6. This suggests the disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers.
