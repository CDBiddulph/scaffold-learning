Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:41,811 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key information:
• The satellites are in low Earth orbit
• They detect astronomical objects
• Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Precision considerations:
• 100-200 arc minutes implies a relatively low precision of detection
• This suggests the objects are likely quite far away
• Low-precision detection works best for distant, widespread objects

3. Distance scale analysis:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
   • These are intergalactic scales
   • Consistent with low-precision detection
   • Astronomical objects would appear very spread out

B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years
   • Galactic or nearby galactic scales
   • Also consistent with low-precision detection
   • Many astronomical objects exist at these distances

C) 10 or 100 light years
   • Very close, local stellar neighborhood
   • Too near for low-precision detection
   • Would require high-precision measurements

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   • Very close, within solar system
   • Much too near for this detection method

4. Conclusion:
Options A and B are most consistent with the described detection method.
