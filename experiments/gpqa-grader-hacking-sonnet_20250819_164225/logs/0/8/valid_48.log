In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:41,809 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. First, understand the goal:
- Create a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene
- Use a dual catalyst system

2. Assess the first statement (A):
- Combined catalyst systems are indeed used in industry
- This statement appears to be TRUE

3. Assess the second statement (B):
- Aluminum-based activators do not work for the additional reaction step
- This requires verification, but seems specific and potentially true

4. Assess the third statement (C):
- Group VIa transition metals might be used in catalysis
- But the specificity suggests this requires careful verification
- Cannot confirm definitively without more research

5. Assess the fourth statement (D):
- Noble metal catalysts are often expensive
- But the claim is a mix of technical capability and economic constraint
- This seems like a reasonable statement

6. Critical reasoning:
- Statement A seems the most straightforward and verifiable
- It describes an actual industrial practice
- Can be confirmed by industrial literature and patents

7. Conclusion:
- Statement A appears to be the most reliable and directly relevant to the scientist's inquiry
