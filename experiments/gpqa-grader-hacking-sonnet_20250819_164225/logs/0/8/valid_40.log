A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:48:39,004 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relativistic velocity transformation formula:
   When an object is moving with velocity u and light is traveling through it with velocity w, the observed velocity in the lab frame is:
   w' = (w - u) / (1 - w*u/c²)

2) In this problem:
   • The speed of light in vacuum is c = 1
   • The glass has refractive index n
   • The glass is moving with velocity v

3) The speed of light in the glass before motion would be w = 1/n

4) Plugging into the relativistic velocity transformation formula:
   w' = (1/n - v) / (1 - (1/n)*v)

5) Algebraically manipulating this:
   w' = (1/n - v) / (1 - v/n)
      = (1 - n*v) / (n - v)
      = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

6) This matches option D exactly.

7) Let's verify the physical intuition:
   • When v = 0, w' = 1/n (normal light speed in glass)
   • The formula accounts for relative motion correctly
