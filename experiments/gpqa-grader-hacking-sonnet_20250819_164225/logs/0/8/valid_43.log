You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-19 23:48:37,218 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to add restriction enzyme sites to the primers to enable directional cloning into the multiple cloning site (MCS).

2. Looking at the MCS, we see HindIII and KpnI as potential sites that can help us achieve directional cloning.

3. Our strategy should add HindIII at the 5' end (start) and KpnI at the 3' end (end) of the sequence.

4. Let's analyze each primer option:
- The forward primer (first part of each option) adds a restriction site at the 5' end
- The reverse primer (second part) adds a restriction site at the 3' end

5. Option A uses HindIII at the 5' end and KpnI at the 3' end, exactly matching our strategy.

6. Importantly, the primer sequences contain the actual start of the gene sequence (ATGAATCCGCGGCAGG) and the complementary end sequence.

7. The added restriction sites will allow directional cloning into the vector, ensuring the gene is in the correct orientation for expression.

Therefore, Option A meets all the requirements for successful directional cloning.
