A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:42,438 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the current situation:
- The student performed a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300°C
- The reaction selectivity and activities are already excellent
- The goal is to increase reactant conversion per pass

2. Analyze the potential strategies:
- Changing temperature can significantly affect reaction kinetics
- Changing catalyst amount or composition can impact reaction dynamics

3. Assess Option A:
- This is defeatist and not a scientific approach
- The student still has time and should explore solutions

4. Evaluate Option B:
- Decreasing temperature might slow down reaction rate
- Simply increasing catalyst amount may not necessarily improve conversion
- This approach lacks consideration of potential chemical complications

5. Consider Option C:
- Decreasing temperature could:
  a) Reduce reaction rate
  b) Prevent possible side reactions
- Increasing catalyst amount might help improve conversion
- Awareness of potential polymerization shows careful scientific consideration
- This seems the most prudent and systematic approach

6. Analyze Option D:
- Increasing temperature could:
  a) Accelerate side reactions
  b) Potentially cause unwanted polymerization
- Decreasing catalyst amount would likely reduce conversion
- This approach seems counterproductive

7. Conclusion:
Option C provides the most balanced, scientific approach to addressing the conversion challenge.
