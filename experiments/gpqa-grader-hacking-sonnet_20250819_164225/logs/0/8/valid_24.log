Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:37,050 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s:
• Distance = Speed × Time
• Time is constant at 1e-5s for all particles

2) Calculate the distance for each particle:
• Zeta: 0.96c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 28.8 km
• Eta: 0.9c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 27 km
• Chi: 0.88c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 26.4 km
• Lambda: 0.93c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 27.9 km

3) Compare to the ground level at 13 km:
• Zeta: 28.8 km > 13 km ✓
• Eta: 27 km > 13 km ✓
• Chi: 26.4 km > 13 km ✓
• Lambda: 27.9 km > 13 km ✓

4) Order by distance traveled:
Zeta (28.8 km) > Lambda (27.9 km) > Eta (27 km) > Chi (26.4 km)
