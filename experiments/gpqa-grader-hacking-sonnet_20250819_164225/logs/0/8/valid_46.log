The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-19 23:48:41,563 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to surface temperature:
   • Peak energy ∝ Temperature

2) For star A: Peak energy = 7.21 eV
   For sun: Peak energy = 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio:
   T(A)/T(sun) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity relates to radius and temperature:
   L = 4πR²σT⁴

5) We're told L(A) = 24L(sun)

6) Substituting and rearranging:
   24 = (R(A)/R(sun))² * (T(A)/T(sun))⁴

7) We know T(A)/T(sun) = 5.11
   So, (R(A)/R(sun))² * (5.11)⁴ = 24

8) (R(A)/R(sun))² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   
9) (R(A)/R(sun)) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   
10) Calculating: R(A)/R(sun) = 0.19
