2025-08-19 23:48:40,624 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Starting material: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
   - This is a cyclic ketone with a bicyclic structure

2) UV irradiation forms product 1
   - The molecular weight is the same
   - This suggests a photochemical reaction like norrish type II cleavage
   - Likely forms a diradical that rearranges to an enol or enol ether

3) Hydrogenation with Pd/C forms product 2
   - This reduces any unsaturation present
   - Converts the enol/enol ether back to a ketone or alcohol

4) The most deshielded hydrogen will be near the carbonyl group

5) After hydrogenation, this hydrogen will be adjacent to the carbonyl
   - This means it will have two different neighboring hydrogens
   - These different neighbors will cause splitting

6) The splitting pattern for a hydrogen with two different neighboring hydrogens is a doublet of doublets

Therefore, the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 2 is a doublet of doublets.
