2025-08-19 23:48:39,417 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lorentz Symmetry:
• The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a quantum field theory
• It must respect Lorentz invariance as a fundamental requirement
• Essential for maintaining the consistency of relativistic physics
• This symmetry MUST be respected

2. Poincare Symmetry:
• Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
• Also fundamental for any relativistic quantum field theory
• SMEFT must respect this symmetry

3. CP Symmetry:
• CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is NOT necessarily preserved in SMEFT
• Operators can be constructed that violate CP symmetry
• This is NOT a required symmetry

4. CPT Symmetry:
• CPT symmetry is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
• It must be respected by construction in any consistent quantum field theory
• This includes SMEFT

Analyzing the requirements, we see that Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry are essential.

These correspond to the symmetries in option A: 1, 2, 4.
