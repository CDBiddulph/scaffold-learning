Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:38,962 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The yield of para-isomer depends on the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.

2) Substituents can be classified as:
• Activating ortho/para directors
• Deactivating meta directors

3) Let's analyze each substituent:
• -CH3 (methyl): Strong activating, strong ortho/para director
• -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weakly deactivating, meta director
• -Cl (chlorine): Weakly deactivating, para director
• -NO2 (nitro): Strong deactivating, strong meta director
• -C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, strong ortho/para director
• -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, para director

4) Para-isomer yield order will depend on the directing ability and activation/deactivation:
• Nitro group (-NO2) will give the lowest para yield
• Ethyl ester will give low para yield
• Carboxylic acid will have moderate para yield
• Chlorine will have higher para yield
• Methyl will have high para yield
• Ethyl will have the highest para yield

5) Following this reasoning, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:
4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5

The answer matches option B.
