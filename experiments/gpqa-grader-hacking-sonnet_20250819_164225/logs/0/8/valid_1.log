Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:38,202 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the half-life of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
• Total time is 80 minutes = 0.057 years

2) Calculate decay rate:
• Number of atoms initially = 10^17
• Fraction of atoms remaining after 80 minutes ≈ 0.99999 (very minimal decay)
• Total decays = 10^17 * (1 - 0.99999) ≈ 10^12 decays

3) Solid angle calculation:
• Detector size: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance: 4 meters = 400 cm
• Solid angle = (Detector area) / (4πr²)
• Solid angle = (6) / (4π * 400²) ≈ 10^-6 steradians

4) Detected gamma-rays:
• Total decays * solid angle = 10^12 * 10^-6 ≈ 10^6 gamma-rays

5) This corresponds to 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays.
