Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:40,174 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas:
• A: C6H13Br
• B: C4H6
• C: C10H18

2. Analyze the 1H NMR signals:
• A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests a molecule with 2-3 different chemical environments
• B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) suggests a molecule like but-1-yne or but-2-yne
• C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests a more complex molecule

3. Consider the reaction types:
• The presence of a halogen (Br) suggests a possible substitution reaction
• The alkyne nature of B suggests a potential coupling or addition reaction

4. Evaluate the given options:
• Option A: Nucleophilic addition of 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
• Option B: Nucleophilic substitution of 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
• Option C: Electrophilic substitution of 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne
• Option D: Nucleophilic substitution of 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne

5. Evaluate Option B in detail:
• Reactants match the molecular formulas
• The product (7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne) matches C10H18
• NMR signals are consistent with the proposed structure
