Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-19 23:48:37,747 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the equilibrium temperature equation:
   T ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) * R^(-1/2)
   Where A is albedo, and R is the orbital radius

2) Since the albedo is the same (0.3) for all planets, we can focus on the radius term

3) Temperature ratio from step 1 gives radius relationships:
   • T(Planet1) / T(Planet2) = 1.4
   • T(Planet2) / T(Planet3) = 2.3

4) Using orbital period relationship P ∝ R^(3/2), we can relate temperatures to periods

5) For mass relationships, we know:
   • Mass(Planet1) / Mass(Planet2) = 1.15
   • Mass(Planet2) / Mass(Planet3) = 1.35

6) The key insight is connecting temperature and orbital period relationships

7) After careful algebraic manipulation, the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 is approximately 10.4

8) This matches option D

Answer: D

The step-by-step reasoning involves understanding how temperature, radius, and orbital period are interrelated, and using the given mass and temperature ratios to derive the period ratio.
