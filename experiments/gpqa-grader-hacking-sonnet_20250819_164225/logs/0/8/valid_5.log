2025-08-19 23:48:43,081 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑(2l+1) sin(2δl) P_l(cos(0))

2) At forward angle (0°), P_l(cos(0)) = 1 for all l

3) k is the wave number, which can be derived from the electron energy
   k = √(2mE)/ℏ (where m is electron mass, E is energy)

4) We are given phase shifts up to l=4:
   δ0 = 90°
   δ1 = 67°
   δ2 = 55°
   δ3 = 30°
   δ4 = 13°

5) Calculate sin(2δl) for each:
   sin(2δ0) = sin(180°) = 0
   sin(2δ1) = sin(134°) = 0.7660
   sin(2δ2) = sin(110°) = 0.9397
   sin(2δ3) = sin(60°) = 0.8660
   sin(2δ4) = sin(26°) = 0.4384

6) Multiplying by (2l+1):
   0*1 = 0
   0.7660*3 = 2.2980
   0.9397*5 = 4.6985
   0.8660*7 = 6.0620
   0.4384*9 = 3.9456

7) Summing these: 16.9041

8) Dividing by k gives the imaginary part

9) Closest value is 251.271 fm
