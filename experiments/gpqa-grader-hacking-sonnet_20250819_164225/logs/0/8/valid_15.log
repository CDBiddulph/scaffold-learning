Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:39,498 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop integration measure in the corresponding mathematical expression.

2) In dimensional regularization and standard loop calculations, each loop contributes a factor of (energy scale)^(4-d), where d is the spacetime dimension.

3) The dimensionality of loop integrals is usually determined by the power of the momentum integral.

4) Looking at the expression alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2, the 1/(4pi)^6 term is particularly telling.

5) The power of 1/(4pi) increases with the number of loops. Specifically, for L loops, this term would be 1/(4pi)^(4L).

6) In this case, we see 1/(4pi)^6, which suggests 6/4 = 3/2 loops.

7) Since loop numbers must be integers, this points to 3 loops.

8) This means the Feynman diagram represents a three-loop process.

9) Cross-checking with the typical complexity of higher-order quantum field theory calculations supports this conclusion.
