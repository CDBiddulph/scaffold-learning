A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:39,775 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the conditions:
   - Inner sphere radius = d1
   - Outer sphere radius = 100d1
   - Wave function is spherically symmetric
   - Wave function is real (no imaginary part)
   - Probability between d1 and 2d1 is P
   - Probability between 2d1 and 3d1 is also P

2) In a spherically symmetric system, the wave function depends only on r

3) Let's call the wave function ψ(r)

4) The probability of finding the particle is proportional to |ψ(r)|^2

5) If P is the same for two different radial ranges, |ψ(r)|^2 must vary in a way that makes these probabilities equal

6) Probability is calculated by integrating |ψ(r)|^2 over the volume shell:
   P = ∫(4πr^2 * |ψ(r)|^2 dr)

7) For this to be constant over different radial ranges, |ψ(r)|^2 must be proportional to 1/r^2

8) This means |ψ(r)| must be proportional to 1/r

9) Since the wave function is real, ψ(r) ∝ 1/r
