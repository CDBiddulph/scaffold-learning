We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:37,508 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   - Decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
   - 50 minutes have already passed
   - We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a conditional probability problem. We want P(decay in next 150 mins | no decay for first 50 mins)

3) The decay process follows an exponential distribution

4) Probability of decay within 100 mins = 0.32
   Probability of no decay within 100 mins = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

5) Given no decay for 50 mins, we need to calculate decay probability for 150 more minutes
   Total time considered now is 150 mins (instead of 100 mins)

6) Probability = 1 - P(no decay in 150 mins)
   = 1 - P(no decay in first 100 mins) × P(no decay between 100-150 mins)
   = 1 - 0.68 × 0.68
   = 1 - 0.4624
   = 0.5376
   = 54% (closest to 52%)

The answer closest to our calculation is 52%.
