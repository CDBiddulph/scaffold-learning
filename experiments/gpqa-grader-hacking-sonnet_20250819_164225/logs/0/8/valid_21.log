S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-19 23:48:41,266 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction: TBS protection
• The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one
• Treatment with TBS-Cl and Et3N will form a silyl ether at the hydroxyl group
• Product 1 is the TBS-protected ketone

2) Second reaction: Organocopper addition and alkylation
• Ph2CuLi adds to the ketone at low temperature
• Then benzyl bromide alkylates the copper intermediate
• Product 2 will be a phenyl-substituted ketone with a benzyl group

3) Third reaction: Methylation
• LDA generates an enolate at low temperature
• Iodomethane alkylates the enolate
• Product 3 is now a methyl-substituted ketone

4) Final hydrolysis
• Aqueous HCl removes the TBS group
• Restores the original hydroxyl group
• Product 4 is the fully deprotected molecule

Based on the transformations, the structure appears to be:
(2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
