Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:41,470 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the experimental observations:
- Hi-C shows a significant interaction signal between an active promoter and active enhancer
- This interaction occurs over ~1 Mb linear distance
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. The fact that dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduces promoter expression suggests a functional interaction exists.

3. Why might Hi-C show an interaction that FISH cannot validate?
- Hi-C uses population-level data from 50M cells
- FISH looks at individual cell interactions
- Population-level interactions might differ from individual cell interactions

4. Key considerations:
- The interaction frequency appears low (only 20% expression reduction)
- Hi-C might detect rare or weak interactions not consistently present in individual cells
- The interaction might be transient or occur in a subset of cells

5. This suggests the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH's resolution and sensitivity.

6. This matches option A: "Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH"
