2025-08-19 23:48:40,017 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equation for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant expression is:
   Kc = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) We know:
   • Total Ca-EDTA concentration = 0.02 M
   • Kc = 5 × 10¹⁰

4) Let x = [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻]
   Then, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x

5) Substitute into the equilibrium constant expression:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

6) This is a complex equation, but given Kc is very large, we can assume x is small compared to 0.02.

7) Rearranging: x² = (5 × 10¹⁰)(0.02 - x)

8) Assuming x is negligible:
   x² = (5 × 10¹⁰)(0.02)
   x = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

9) This is the concentration of calcium ions.
