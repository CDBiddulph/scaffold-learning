Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:48:39,917 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the charge values:
• Each particle has charge 2e
• 12 particles are fixed in a circle at 2 m from point P
• 13th particle is at point P (the center)

2) Electrostatic potential energy calculation:
• Formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r
• k = 8.99 x 10^9 N*m^2/C^2
• Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 * (1.6 x 10^-19) = 3.2 x 10^-19 C

3) Calculate energy between center charge and each circle charge:
• Distance = 2 m
• Energy per pair = (8.99 x 10^9) * (3.2 x 10^-19)^2 / 2
• = 8.99 x 10^9 * 1.024 x 10^-38 / 2
• = 4.60 x 10^-29 J

4) Number of interactions:
• 12 charges around center
• 12 charge pairs between circle charges
• Total interactions = 12 + (12 * 11 / 2) = 78

5) Total energy:
• 12 * 4.60 x 10^-29 = 5.52 x 10^-28 J

6) Checking options, 5.645 x 10^-26 J is closest.
