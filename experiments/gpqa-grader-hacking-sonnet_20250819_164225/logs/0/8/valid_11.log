All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:48:42,502 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) Pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting:
- The statement appears technically sound
- Describes the relationship between pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting rate
- Mentions the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
- Seems scientifically accurate

B) nsp10/nsp14-ExoN mechanism:
- Describes the heterodimer operation
- Explains the exonuclease complex's role in preventing dsRNA breakdown
- The details seem consistent with current molecular biology understanding

C) ORF3a and apoptosis:
- Describes caspase-8 activation
- Notes the lack of effect on Bcl-2 expression
- Suggests activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
- The description appears scientifically valid

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting:
- States that frameshifting creates two polyproteins
- Mentions slippery nucleotides and pseudoknot mechanism
- Claims SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the "same conformation" as SARS-CoV

The last statement (D) seems problematic. While the mechanism is similar, claiming they have the "exact same conformation" is likely an oversimplification. Viral proteins can have subtle conformational differences.

Therefore, statement D appears to be the least accurate.
