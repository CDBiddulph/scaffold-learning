You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.
