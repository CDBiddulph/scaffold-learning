2025-08-19 23:54:58,589 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework for studying physics beyond the Standard Model.

2. Lorentz symmetry:
• Fundamental requirement of any relativistic quantum field theory
• Must be respected by all SMEFT operators
• This means operators m
