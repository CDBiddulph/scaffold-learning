What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:58,488 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) The dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as:
   KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA] = 5 × 10¹⁰

3) The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

4) Let x
