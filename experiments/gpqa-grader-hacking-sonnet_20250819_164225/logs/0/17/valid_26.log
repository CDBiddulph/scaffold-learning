The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-19 23:55:00,179 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between angular size θ, radius R, and distance d:
   θ = R/d (in radians)

2) Given: 
   d = 10^10 parsecs
   θ = 10^-17 degrees = 10^-17 * (π/180) radians

3) The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is given by:
   R = 2GM/c²
