The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-19 23:55:08,343 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the Wien displacement law relationship between peak photon energy and temperature:
• Energy is proportional to temperature

2) Star A's peak energy is 7.21 eV
• Sun's peak energy is 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio can be found by energy ratio:
• T
