2025-08-19 23:54:59,051 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall what a Cope rearrangement does:
• It involves a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement
• Typically occurs at elevated temperatures
• Involves migration of atoms and bonds to create a new molecular structure

2) Look at the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2
