2025-08-19 23:55:07,967 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light color and energy:
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (red/yellow end of spectrum)

2) The problem gives the emission energy as
