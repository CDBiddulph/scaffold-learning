2025-08-19 23:54:56,031 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Start with trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O)
• This has a 3-carbon side chain and an aldehyde group
• 9 carbon atoms total

2. Treat with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent)
• This adds a methyl group to the aldehyde
• Produces an alcohol (Product 1)
• Now has 10
