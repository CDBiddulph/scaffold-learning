For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:10,083 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) were originally developed by Peskin and Walkauer to constrain new physics through electroweak precision tests.

2) In multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM), these parameters can be modified by the presence of additional scalar particles.
