You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:00,341 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the patterns in the given inputs and outputs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. Let's count the occurrences of each base in these inputs:
   AGG: A=1, G=2
   TGCTGA: T=2, G=2, C=1

3. This suggests the output is not a simple count, but somethi
