An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25

2025-08-19 23:55:07,704 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the general formula for expectation value:
   • For spin, expectation value = ψ† σ_y ψ
   • ψ here is the given state vector (3i, 4)

2) Let's write out σ_y explicitly:
   σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

3) Compute ψ†:
   ψ†
