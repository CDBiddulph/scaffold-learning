We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:58,417 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the probability of decay within 100 minutes: 32%

2) We know that 50 minutes have already passed without decay

3) We can use the complementary conditional probability method:
   P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes)

4)
