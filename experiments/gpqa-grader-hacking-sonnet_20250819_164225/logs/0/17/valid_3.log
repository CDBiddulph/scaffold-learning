2025-08-19 23:54:58,330 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that density is defined as mass divided by volume.

2) Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
   • This would have the same density as Earth (approximately 5.5 g/cm³)

3) Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and density of 5.5 g/cm³
