In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:10,670 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial conditions:
   • Volume ratio of (A+B) : C = 1 : 2.25
   • A:B volume ratio = 1 : 1
   • Densities of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11

2) Let's assign volumes:
   • A volume = x
   • B volume = x
   • C volume = 2.25 × (x+x) =
