Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:56,637 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) The two fundamental forces being described here are:
   • Gravitational force (attractive)
   • Electrostatic force (repulsive)

2) The smallest charge is the elementary charge (e), and for mass, let's consider the electron mass.

3) The force laws for these intera
