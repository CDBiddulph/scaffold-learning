Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:57,101 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) Caesium-137 decay characteristics:
• Half-life is about 30 years
• Each atom decays and emits a gamma ray

2) Number of decays per unit time:
• Total atoms = 10^17
• Decay rate = λN, where λ is decay constant
• λ = ln(2)/half-life
• Decay rate ≈ 10^17 × ln(2)/(30 ×
