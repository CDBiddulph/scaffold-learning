bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:55:09,369 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) The starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is a rigid bicyclic ketone.

2) UV irradiation with the same molecular weight suggests a photochemical reaction that likely involves the ketone. This suggests a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition, forming a c
