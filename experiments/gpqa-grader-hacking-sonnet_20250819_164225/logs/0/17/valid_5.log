Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

2025-08-19 23:55:01,166 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/2ik) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cos(0))

2) At 0°, cos(0) = 1, so P_l(1) = 1, 1, 1/2, -1/2, etc.

3) k is the wave number. At 50 MeV, k can be calculated:
   k = √(2
