Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:54:59,181 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's determine the molecular formula for each set

2) Using % composition and molecular weight:
• A) MW ≈ 72, Empirical formula suggests C5H12
• B) MW ≈ 86, Empirical formula suggests C6H14
• C) MW ≈ 58, Empirical formula suggests C4H10
• D) MW ≈ 100, Empir
