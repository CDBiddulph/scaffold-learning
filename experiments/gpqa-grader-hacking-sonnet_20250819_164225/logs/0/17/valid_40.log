A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:55:09,288 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the scenario:
   - Speed of light in vacuum is c = 1
   - Index of refraction of the glass is n
   - Glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer

2) When light travels through a moving medium, we need to consider relativistic effects.
