Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-19 23:54:58,667 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log(distance/10 parsecs)

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) At 50 parsecs: 
   • Already an apparent magnitude of 7
   • 5 log(50/10) = 5 log(5) = 5 * 0.7 = 3.5
   • Apparen
