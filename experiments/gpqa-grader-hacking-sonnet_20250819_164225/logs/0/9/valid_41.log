2025-08-19 23:49:09,977 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) The color of light absorbed by a substance is complementary to the color of light it emits.

2) First, let's understand the energy of the emitted light:
   • The emission energy is 2.3393 eV
   • This corresponds to a specific wavelength in the visible spectrum

3) To find the color of the absorbed light, we need to look at the complementary color:
   • 2.3393 eV falls in the visible light range
   • The complementary color can be determined by looking at the color wheel

4) Let's consider the approximate energies of different colors:
   • Violet: ~3.1 eV
   • Blue: ~2.8 eV
   • Green: ~2.5 eV
   • Yellow: ~2.2 eV
   • Red: ~1.8 eV

5) 2.3393 eV is closest to the green-yellow range

6) The complementary color to green-yellow is violet

7) Therefore, the dye would absorb violet light when it emits green-yellow light
