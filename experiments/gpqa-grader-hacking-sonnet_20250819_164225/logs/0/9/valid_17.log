Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:20,875 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the molecular formulas and NMR data:
• A has molecular formula C6H13Br (1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane)
• B has molecular formula C4H6 (looks like but-1-yne or but-2-yne)
• C has molecular formula C10H18

2) For the reaction mechanism:
• We need a reaction that converts A and B into C
• The molecular formula suggests a carbon-carbon bond formation
• The NMR data of C (5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests a complex alkyne structure

3) Analyzing the options:
• Option A suggests nucleophilic addition
• Option B suggests nucleophilic substitution with but-1-yne
• Option C suggests electrophilic substitution with but-2-yne
• Option D suggests nucleophilic substitution with 3-methylbut-1-yne

4) Key observations:
• Alkyl halides typically undergo nucleophilic substitution
• The reaction involves forming a new carbon-carbon bond
• The product molecular formula matches option B's pathway

5) Option B provides the most consistent explanation: a nucleophilic substitution reaction between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
