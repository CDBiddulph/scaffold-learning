2025-08-19 23:49:17,468 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon.

2) The area of the event horizon is proportional to the square of its radius.

3) The angular size θ relates to the radius R of the event horizon by:
   θ = R/d, where d is the distance

4) Rearranging the equation: R = θ * d
   R = 10^-17 * 10^10 parsecs
   R = 10^-7 parsecs

5) 1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   R = 10^-7 * 3 * 10^16 meters
   R ≈ 10^10 meters

6) Black hole entropy S = kB * (Area / 4 * Planck Area)
   S ∝ R^2 / (Planck Length)^2

7) Planck length ≈ 10^-35 meters

8) Substituting values gives entropy on the order of 10^65 J/K

9) This matches option D.
