Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:18,320 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, the smallest charge is the elementary charge, e = 1.602 × 10^-19 C

2) The attractive force here is gravity, given by Newton's law: F_g = G(m1m2)/r^2
   Where G is the gravitational constant

3) The repulsive force is electrostatic, given by Coulomb's law: F_e = k(q1q2)/r^2
   Where k is Coulomb's constant

4) For the smallest possible mass, let's use the electron mass, m_e ≈ 9.1 × 10^-31 kg

5) The distance r is specified as 137 meters

6) The ratio of forces will be: (Electrostatic force) / (Gravitational force)
   = [k(e^2/r^2)] / [G(m_e^2/r^2)]
   = [k(e^2)] / [G(m_e^2)]

7) This ratio is independent of r, and will equal: [k(e^2)] / [G(m_e^2)]

8) This ratio is actually very close to 10^39

9) The question asks for 1/137, which is C: 1/137^2
