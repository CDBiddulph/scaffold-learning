A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-19 23:49:19,193 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the key observation:
• The embryo has different DNA sequences in different tissue types
• This suggests the genetic modification did not occur uniformly during early embryo development

2. Consider the possible mechanisms:

A) Converting mRNA to cDNA and genome incorporation:
• This is unlikely - mRNA doesn't typically get reverse transcribed and integrated randomly
• This mechanism isn't a standard explanation for mosaic genetic modifications

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex integration:
• Again, this is not a standard mechanism for genetic modification
• CRISPR works through precise DNA cutting and repair mechanisms

C) Surrogate mother's DNA incorporation:
• This is not a plausible mechanism for genetic variation
• DNA from the surrogate mother would not randomly integrate into embryo cells

D) Continuous DNA cutting and donor DNA incorporation:
• This explains the mosaic genome observation
• If Cas9 continues cutting at different stages of embryo development, some cells will be modified while others remain unmodified
• This leads to different genome sequences in different cell lineages
• This phenomenon is known as "genetic mosaicism"

3. Reasoning conclusion:
The most probable cause is ongoing CRISPR-Cas9 activity during early embryo development.
