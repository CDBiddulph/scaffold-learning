Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:21,262 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the information given:
• Low Earth orbit satellites are detecting astronomical objects
• They can localize these objects with precision of 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Localization precision helps us understand the potential distance range:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
• This suggests the objects are relatively far away

3. Let's analyze the options:
• Option A: 1 million or 1 billion light years
- These are extragalactic distances
- Consistent with large angular uncertainty
- Very large scales match isotropic distribution

• Option B: 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years
- Galactic scale distances
- Also consistent with isotropic distribution and large angular uncertainty

• Option C: 10 or 100 light years
- Too close to provide such large angular uncertainty
- Would require more precise localization

• Option D: 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
- Far too close
- Within solar system scale
- Not consistent with astronomical object detection

4. Reasoning points to options A or B as most likely.
