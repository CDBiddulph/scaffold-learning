Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:10,960 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the half-life of Caesium-137
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years (or 15,768,000 minutes)

2) Calculate decay constant λ
• λ = ln(2) / half-life
• λ = 0.693 / 15,768,000 = 4.4 × 10^-8 per minute

3) Number of decays in 80 minutes
• Initial number of atoms = 10^17
• Fraction of atoms remaining = exp(-λt)
• exp(-4.4 × 10^-8 × 80) ≈ 1 (negligible decay)

4) Each decay emits a gamma ray
• Theoretical gamma rays = 10^17

5) Detector solid angle calculation
• Area = 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance = 4 meters = 400 cm
• Solid angle = (6 / (400)²) × (4π) ≈ 10^-3 steradians

6) Detected gamma rays
• Detected gamma rays = 10^17 × 10^-3 = 10^14 × 10^-3 = 10^6

The closest answer is 1 million (10^6).
