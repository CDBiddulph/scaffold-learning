bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:49:16,163 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV light
   • This suggests a photochemical reaction
   • Since the molecular weight remains the same, this is likely a rearrangement or isomerization

2) Upon UV irradiation, the ketone likely undergoes a photochemical decarbonylation/recarbonylation, forming an isomeric ketone

3) When this product is then treated with H2/Pd, this suggests a reduction
   • Hydrogen will add across the ketone, forming an alcohol
   • This reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol

4) In the 1H NMR spectrum of this alcohol:
   • The most deshielded hydrogen will be the alcohol hydrogen
   • The alcohol hydrogen is typically a singlet (exchanges rapidly)

5) Thus, the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus would appear as a singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum

Therefore, the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus will be a singlet.
