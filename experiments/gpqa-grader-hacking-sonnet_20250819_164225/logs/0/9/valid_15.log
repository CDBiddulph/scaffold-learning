Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:17,158 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory Feynman diagrams, the loop count is directly related to the power of the loop momentum integration in the corresponding calculation.

2) In general, an n-loop diagram will have 1/(4π)^(2n) appearing in its dimensional analysis.

3) In the given expression, we see 1/(4π)^6.

4) To determine the loop count, we can solve the equation:
   (4π)^(2n) = 1/(4π)^6

5) Rearranging this:
   2n = -6

6) Solving for n:
   n = -3

7) However, a negative loop count doesn't make physical sense. The actual number of loops would be the absolute value of this.

8) So the number of loops is 3.

9) Checking the available options, 3 corresponds to option D.

Answer: D

Reasoning: The 1/(4π)^6 term indicates 3 loops in the Feynman diagram, which matches the powers of the loop momentum integration typical in quantum field theory calculations.
