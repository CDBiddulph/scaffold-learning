In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:22,140 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the context:
• The scientist wants to generate a polymer with regular branches
• Only ethylene will be used as the monomer
• A dual catalyst system is proposed

2) Breaking down the statements:
A) Claims these systems are already industrially implemented in the US
- This requires verification, but seems plausible

B) Claims aluminum-based activators won't work
- This requires specific chemical knowledge about catalyst systems

C) Suggests using a group VIa transition metal catalyst with specific activators
- Group VIa includes chromium, molybdenum, tungsten
- These metals are known in polymerization catalysis

D) Claims noble metal catalysts exist but are too expensive
- Noble metal catalysts are often used in specialized chemical processes
- Cost can indeed be a significant factor

3) Technical assessment:
• Catalysts for ethylene polymerization with branching typically involve metallocene or other complex catalysts
• Group VIa metals (especially chromium) are known for creating branched polyethylene
• The statement about aluminum activators is specific and likely based on practical experience

4) Most technically precise and informative statement appears to be C

Answer: C
