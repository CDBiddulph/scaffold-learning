2025-08-19 23:49:11,125 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Density is defined as mass divided by volume. For a spherical planet, volume depends on radius.

2) Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
   - This would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3) Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3:
   - Density is explicitly stated as 5.5 g/cm³
   - This matches Earth's density

4) Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:
   - If mass increases 5 times but composition is the same, volume will also increase 5 times
   - Density = Mass/Volume will remain the same as Earth's density (5.5 g/cm³)

5) Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:
   - If mass decreases by half but composition is the same, volume will also decrease by half
   - Density = Mass/Volume will remain the same as Earth's density (5.5 g/cm³)

6) Comparing the densities, they are all approximately the same at 5.5 g/cm³.

Since they're all equal, the answer could be any of them. However, the question asks which has the "highest" density.

The slight variations in the calculations might make option a) have the most precise Earth density.
