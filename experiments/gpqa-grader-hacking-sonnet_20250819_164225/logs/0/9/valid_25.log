A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-19 23:49:15,203 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the conditions:
   - Inner sphere radius = d1
   - Outer sphere radius = 100*d1
   - Probability in region d1 to 2*d1 = P
   - Probability in region 2*d1 to 3*d1 = P

2) In spherical coordinates, the probability density is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2.

3) Let's assume the wave function is of the form Ψ(r) = f(r)

4) The probability of finding the particle in a spherical shell is proportional to:
   ∫(4πr^2 * |Ψ(r)|^2)dr

5) The condition that probabilities are equal between d1-2d1 and 2d1-3d1 implies:
   r^2 * |Ψ(r)|^2 must be constant in these regions

6) This means |Ψ(r)|^2 must be proportional to 1/r^2

7) Therefore, Ψ(r) must be proportional to 1/r

8) The wave function satisfies the condition that its imaginary part is zero.

Therefore, the wave function has the form 1/r.
