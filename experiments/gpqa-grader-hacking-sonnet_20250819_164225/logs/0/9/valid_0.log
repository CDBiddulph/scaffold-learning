Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:10,140 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1st Reaction (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)):
- This is a Claisen-like rearrangement
- The terminal alkene will migrate
- The product will be a 6-membered ring with an amine group
- This matches 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine

2nd Reaction ((3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat)):
- This is a Cope rearrangement
- The terminal alkynes will shift to form a cyclobutene
- The stereochemistry will change
- The product will be (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane

3rd Reaction (2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat)):
- This is an allyl vinyl ether rearrangement
- The reaction will open the ether and form an aldehyde
- The product will be 4-methylenehexanal

Checking the options, the reactions match exactly with option A.
