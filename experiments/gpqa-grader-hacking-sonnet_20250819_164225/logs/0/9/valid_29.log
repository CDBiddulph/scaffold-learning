Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:49:20,587 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a molecule to be optically active, it must:
• Have a chiral carbon center
• Not have a plane of symmetry
• Be asymmetric

2) This requires a saturated hydrocarbon with an uneven number of carbon atoms or a specific structural arrangement

3) Let's analyze the molecular masses from the EI-MS data:
A) Molecular mass ≈ 72
B) Molecular mass ≈ 86
C) Molecular mass ≈ 58
D) Molecular mass ≈ 100

4) To be optically active, the molecule must have a unique molecular structure

5) With these constraints, the most likely candidate is B: Molecular mass 86, which could represent a molecule like 3-methylpentane

6) 3-methylpentane has a chiral carbon center and would be optically active
• Empirical formula would match the elemental composition
• Would give the mass fragmentation pattern shown

7) This molecule has an asymmetric carbon at the 3-position, breaking symmetry and enabling optical activity

Therefore, the optically active saturated hydrocarbon is in option B.
