The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-19 23:49:18,772 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law, which relates the peak wavelength/energy to temperature:
   T ∝ (peak energy)

2) Peak energy for star A: 7.21 eV
   Peak energy for sun: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio:
   T(A)/T(sun) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity depends on radius and temperature:
   L ∝ R² * T⁴

5) We know star A is 24 times as luminous as the sun.
   24 = R²(A) * T⁴(A) / (R²(sun) * T⁴(sun))

6) Temperature ratio is 5.11, so:
   24 = R²(A) * (5.11)⁴ / R²(sun)

7) Solving for R(A)/R(sun):
   R(A)/R(sun) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
               = √(24 / 671.7)
               = √(0.0357)
               = 0.19

8) This matches option B.
