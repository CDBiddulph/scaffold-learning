Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:18,936 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the directing effects of each substituent:

1) Substituent Classification and Directing Effects:
• Electron-donating groups (EDG) favor para and ortho substitution
• Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) favor meta substitution
• The strength of the directing effect varies

2) Analyzing each substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Strong EDG, strongly para-directing
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weak EWG, slightly meta-directing
3) C6H5-Cl (chloro): Weak EWG, slightly meta-directing
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro): Strong EWG, strongly meta-directing
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl): Strong EDG, strongly para-directing
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid): Weak EWG, slightly meta-directing

3) Ranking para-isomer yield:
• Strong EDG substituents (methyl, ethyl) will have highest para yield
• Weak EWG substituents will have moderate para yield
• Strong EWG substituents will have lowest para yield

4) Ordering from lowest to highest para yield:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

This matches option C.
