Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:21,028 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the formula for electric potential energy between point charges:
   U = kq1q2/r
   where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

2) We have:
   • 12 charges with 2e at 2m from point P
   • 1 charge of 2e at point P
   • Each charge is 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) Each charge interacts with the charge at P:
   • Energy between a charge at P and each of the 12 charges = kq1q2/r
   • U = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2
   • U = (8.99 × 10^9) × (10.24 × 10^-38) / 2
   • U = 4.59 × 10^-27 J per interaction

4) Total interaction energy:
   • 12 interactions
   • Total = 12 × (4.59 × 10^-27)
   • Total = 5.508 × 10^-26 J

5) Checking the answer choices, this is closest to option C.
