S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-19 23:49:17,237 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction: TBS protection
• (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is protected with TBS chloride
• This replaces the hydroxyl group with a TBS group
• Product 1 is the TBS-protected ketone

2) Second reaction: Cuprate addition and alkylation
• Ph2CuLi adds to the ketone at low temperature
• Benzyl bromide then alkylates the cuprate intermediate
• This introduces a phenyl group and a benzyl group
• Product 2 is now a protected ketone with a phenyl substituent

3) Third reaction: LDA and methylation
• LDA deprotonates the molecule at the α-position
• Iodomethane adds a methyl group
• Product 3 now has an additional methyl group

4) Final reaction: HCl deprotection
• HCl removes the TBS group, restoring the hydroxyl
• The stereochemistry is determined by the previous steps

By carefully tracking the stereochemistry and functional group transformations, the structure is (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.
