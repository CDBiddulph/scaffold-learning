Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:20,252 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s:
   Distance = Speed × Time
   • Zeta: 0.96c × (1e-5s) = 0.96 × 3 × 10^4 m = 28,800 m
   • Eta: 0.9c × (1e-5s) = 0.9 × 3 × 10^4 m = 27,000 m
   • Chi: 0.88c × (1e-5s) = 0.88 × 3 × 10^4 m = 26,400 m
   • Lambda: 0.93c × (1e-5s) = 0.93 × 3 × 10^4 m = 27,900 m

2) Compare these distances to the ground level (13,000 m):
   • Zeta: 28,800 m > 13,000 m (will reach ground)
   • Eta: 27,000 m > 13,000 m (will reach ground)
   • Chi: 26,400 m > 13,000 m (will reach ground)
   • Lambda: 27,900 m > 13,000 m (will reach ground)

3) Order by total particles reaching ground from highest to lowest:
   • Zeta: 30,000 particles
   • Lambda: 24,000 particles
   • Eta: 20,000 particles
   • Chi: 19,000 particles

4) This corresponds to the order: zeta > lambda > eta > chi

The answer matches option B.
