2025-08-19 23:49:22,225 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that apparent magnitude depends on both the intrinsic brightness (absolute magnitude) and distance of the star/system.

2) For single stars:
- A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 at 20 parsecs will be same as that at 50 parsecs
- For a star with absolute magnitude of 7 at 10 parsecs, we can calculate its apparent magnitude using the distance modulus formula
   m = M + 5 log(d/10), where m is apparent, M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs
   m = 7 + 5 log(10/10) = 7

3) For star systems, the combined brightness depends on adding their flux, not their magnitudes.

4) For the two-star systems:
- At 5 parsecs with Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8, the system will be quite bright
- At 10 parsecs with Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7, they'll be identical and close in brightness

5) Comparing the apparent magnitudes and considering the relative distances, the 5-parsec system with individual magnitudes 7 and 8 will be the brightest.
