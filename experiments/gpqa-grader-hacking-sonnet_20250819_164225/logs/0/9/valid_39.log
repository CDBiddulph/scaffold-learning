ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-19 23:49:22,478 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. ChIP-seq with PFA fixation captures protein-DNA interactions that are relatively stable and cross-linked.

2. Adding DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) introduces additional, stronger cross-linking compared to PFA alone.

3. The disappearance of peaks suggests that the DSG fixation is disrupting certain protein-DNA interactions that were preserved in PFA.

4. Certain genomic regions have more transient or dynamic protein interactions:
- Repeats tend to have less specific binding
- Introns might have variable protein occupancy
- Random genomic locations are unlikely to show systematic peak loss

5. Active promoters and enhancers are known for:
- Frequent transcription factor binding
- Rapid protein exchange and dynamic interactions
- Sensitive to changes in cross-linking conditions
- Often have weak or transient transcription factor interactions

6. Dynamic transcription factor binding at active regulatory elements would be most likely to be disrupted by more stringent cross-linking, causing peak disappearance.

7. This matches the characteristics of IKAROS binding at active regulatory regions in B cells.

Based on this reasoning, active promoters and enhancers are the most likely location for these disappearing peaks.
