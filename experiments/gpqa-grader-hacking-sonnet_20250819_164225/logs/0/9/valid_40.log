A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:49:19,682 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the scenario:
   • The beam is traveling through a glass with refractive index n
   • The glass is moving at velocity v in the direction of the beam
   • We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer

2) This is a problem of relative motion, involving the speed of light in a moving medium

3) The key formula for this scenario is the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   u' = (u - v) / (1 - u*v/c²)
   Where:
   • u' is the observed velocity
   • u is the velocity in the medium
   • v is the medium's velocity
   • c is the speed of light in vacuum

4) In our problem, c = 1, and u = 1/n (speed of light in the glass)

5) Substituting these values:
   u' = (1/n - v) / (1 - v/n)

6) Simplifying this expression:
   u' = (1/n - v) / (1 - v/n)
      = (1 - n*v) / (n - v)
      = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) This matches option D
