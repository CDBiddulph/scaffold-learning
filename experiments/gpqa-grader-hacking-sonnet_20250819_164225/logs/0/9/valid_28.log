Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:19,497 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's analyze the terms in each group and cross-reference them with the passage:

2. Option A:
- Translocation into nucleus ✓ (mentioned in passage)
- Intracellular calcium ✓ (mentioned)
- Destruction complex ✓ (mentioned)
- Frizzled ✓ (mentioned)
GOOD GROUP

3. Option B:
- Proteasomal degradation ✓ (mentioned)
- N-terminal extracellular ✓ (mentioned)
- Frizzled ✓ (mentioned)
- Non-canonical ✓ (mentioned)
ANOTHER GOOD GROUP

4. Option C:
- Beta-catenin ✓ (mentioned)
- Directly binds DNA ✓ (mentioned)
- LRP5/6 ✓ (mentioned)
- Transmembrane receptor protein ✓ (mentioned)
ANOTHER GOOD GROUP

5. Option D:
- Transcriptional co-activator ✓ (mentioned)
- Glycoprotein ✓ (mentioned)
- Accumulation in cytoplasm ✓ (mentioned)
- Beta-catenin ✓ (mentioned)
GOOD GROUP

6. Since multiple options seem valid, I'll look for subtle differences.

7. All groups seem to contain completely accurate terms from the passage.

8. After careful review, Option C seems the most precise and directly related representation of the key components of the Wnt3a signaling pathway.
