2025-08-19 23:49:10,148 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the dissociation equation for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The stability constant (K) is defined as:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) We know:
   • [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M
   • K = 5 × 10¹⁰

4) Rearranging the stability constant equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5) At equilibrium, [EDTA⁴⁻] ≈ [Ca²⁺]

6) Substituting the known values:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10¹⁰) × (0.02) / [Ca²⁺]

7) Solving this equation:
   [Ca²⁺]² = 5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02
   [Ca²⁺] = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   [Ca²⁺] = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

8) Looking at the given options, this corresponds to option B.
