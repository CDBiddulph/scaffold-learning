We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:10,410 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the given information:
   • Initial decay probability within 100 minutes: 32%
   • 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   • We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This suggests a scenario where the atom has already survived 50 minutes

3) This is a problem involving conditional probability and exponential decay

4) Let's calculate the probability of NOT decaying in the first 100 minutes
   • Probability of decay = 32%
   • Probability of not decaying = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

5) The atom has already survived 50 minutes, so now we want to know its decay probability in the next 150 minutes

6) Key insight: If the atom survived the first 50 minutes, the remaining probability of decay follows the same exponential decay pattern as before

7) The additional decay probability can be calculated relative to the remaining 0.68 probability

8) Using proportional reasoning:
   • Original decay probability (100 min): 32%
   • New decay probability (150 min): (32/100) * 150 = 48%

9) 48% matches option A
