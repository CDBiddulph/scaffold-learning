Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:20,051 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the equilibrium temperature formula:
   T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2)
   Where A is the albedo, R_star is stellar radius, a is orbital distance

2) The temperature ratio between two planets is related to their orbital distances:
   (T1/T2)^4 = (a2/a1)^2

3) From the temperature ratios given:
   (T1/T2)^4 = 1.4^4 = 3.8416
   (T2/T3)^4 = 2.3^4 = 28.9729

4) This implies that:
   a2/a1 ≈ √3.8416 = 1.96
   a3/a2 ≈ √28.9729 = 5.38

5) The orbital period is proportional to (orbital distance)^(3/2):
   (P3/P1) = (a3/a1)^(3/2)

6) (a3/a1) = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1) = 5.38 * 1.96 = 10.54

7) Therefore, (P3/P1) ≈ 10.54^(3/2) ≈ 10.4

8) The mass ratios don't play a role in this calculation.
