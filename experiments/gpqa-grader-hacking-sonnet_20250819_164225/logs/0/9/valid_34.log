You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:19,215 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the pattern of inputs and outputs:
• AGG input = 115 output
• TGCTGA input = 176 output

2. Let's break this down character by character:
• The algorithm seems to be doing something with each character's position

3. I'll count the occurrences of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) in the known inputs:
• AGG: 1 A, 2 G
• TGCTGA: 2 T, 1 G, 1 C, 2 A

4. For ACAGTGACC, let's count the nucleotides:
• 3 A's
• 2 C's
• 2 G's
• 1 T

5. If we look at the pattern, it seems the algorithm might be multiplying the count of each nucleotide by its position and then summing these values.

6. To verify this hypothesis would require more inputs, but based on the given data, ACAGTGACC looks like it would produce 351.
