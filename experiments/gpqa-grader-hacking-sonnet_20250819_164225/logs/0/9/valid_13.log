2025-08-19 23:49:20,146 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lorentz Symmetry:
• The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is fundamentally a quantum field theory
• All quantum field theories must respect Lorentz symmetry
• Therefore, this symmetry is mandatory ✓

2. Poincaré Symmetry:
• Poincaré symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and spacetime translations
• As a relativistic field theory, SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry ✓

3. CP Symmetry:
• CP symmetry is not a fundamental requirement of SMEFT
• Some SMEFT operators can potentially violate CP symmetry
• Not mandatory ✗

4. CPT Symmetry:
• CPT symmetry is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
• All local quantum field theories must respect CPT symmetry
• Therefore, this symmetry is mandatory ✓

Combining the conditions, we see that Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.
