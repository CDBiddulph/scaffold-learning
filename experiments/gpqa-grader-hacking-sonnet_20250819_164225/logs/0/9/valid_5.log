2025-08-19 23:49:13,343 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:

   $Im(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)$

2) We're given phase shifts for partial waves up to $l=4$:
   • $\delta_0 = 90°$
   • $\delta_1 = 67°$
   • $\delta_2 = 55°$
   • $\delta_3 = 30°$
   • $\delta_4 = 13°$

3) We need to calculate $\sin(\delta_l)$ for each:
   • $\sin(90°) = 1$
   • $\sin(67°) = 0.9239$
   • $\sin(55°) = 0.8192$
   • $\sin(30°) = 0.5$
   • $\sin(13°) = 0.2250$

4) The formula includes $(2l+1)$ weighting:
   • 0: (2(0)+1) × sin(90°) = 1 × 1 = 1
   • 1: (2(1)+1) × sin(67°) = 3 × 0.9239 = 2.7717
   • 2: (2(2)+1) × sin(55°) = 5 × 0.8192 = 4.096
   • 3: (2(3)+1) × sin(30°) = 7 × 0.5 = 3.5
   • 4: (2(4)+1) × sin(13°) = 9 × 0.2250 = 2.025

5) Sum these and multiply by $\frac{1}{2ik}$

6) At 50 MeV, $k$ is roughly $\sqrt{2mE} ≈ 177.675$ fm^-1

7) Calculation: $\frac{1}{2 × 177.675} × (1 + 2.7717 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.025) = 177.675$ fm

8) This matches option A.
