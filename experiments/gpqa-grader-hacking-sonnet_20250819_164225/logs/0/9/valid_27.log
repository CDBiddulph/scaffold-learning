2025-08-19 23:49:19,845 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   • <S_y> = <ψ|σ_y|ψ>
   • Where |ψ> = (3i, 4) is the spin state vector

2) σ_y is given as: \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

3) Let's calculate the components:
   • First, the bra vector <ψ| = (3i*, 4*)
   • Note the complex conjugate due to inner product rules

4) Now multiply:
   <ψ|σ_y|ψ> = (3i*, 4*) \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} (3i, 4)

5) This breaks down to:
   • (3i*)(-i)(4) + (3i*)(0)(3i)
   • = -3i * i * 4
   • = -12i^2
   • = -12 * (-1)
   • = 12

6) Recall that expectation value is typically in units of ℏ (reduced Planck's constant)

7) So <S_y> = 12 * ℏ/25

8) This matches option A: 12*ℏ/25
