You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:49:20,109 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I need to look at the multiple cloning site (MCS) in the expression vector:
• SmaI, HindIII, BglII, KpnI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI are available
• We want directional cloning with two different enzymes

2. I'll look at the sequence and note the enzymes in the given list
• HindIII and KpnI are both in the MCS

3. Primer requirements:
• First primer should start at the ATG start codon
• Must have a HindIII site (AAGCTT) added at the 5' end
• Must have the first ~15-20 bases of the gene

4. Second primer requirements:
• Must include a stop codon (not shown, so assume last codon)
• Must have a KpnI site (GGTACC) added at the 5' end
• Must have reverse complement of last ~15-20 bases

5. Examining the options:
• Option A uses HindIII and KpnI correctly
• Primers match the sequence requirements
• Will insert in correct orientation

Answer: A
