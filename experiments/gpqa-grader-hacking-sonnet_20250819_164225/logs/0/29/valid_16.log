A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-20 00:04:50,781 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what happened:
- Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA were injected into a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The embryo developed to full term
- Different tissues had different genome sequences

2. This phenomenon suggests genetic mosaicism, where not all cells have the same genetic modification.

3. Key factors to consider:
- The gene editing occurred at the 1-cell stage
- Different cell lineages developed with different genetic modifications

4. Most likely explanation:
- The CRISPR-Cas9 system did not uniformly modify all cells during early embryonic development
- As the embryo divided and cells differentiated, some cells were successfully modified while others were not
- This led to a mosaic pattern of genetic modification across different tissues

5. Analyzing the options:
- Option A is unlikely (cDNA conversion is not a typical mechanism)
- Option B is not a standard mechanism for mosaicism
- Option C is not plausible
- Option D describes the most probable mechanism for genetic mosaicism

6. The continuous DNA cutting by Cas9 at different stages would create varying genetic modifications as the embryo develops.
