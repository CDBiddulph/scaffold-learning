2025-08-20 00:04:50,576 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑(2l+1)sin(2δl)

2) Here, k is the wave number:
   • At 50 MeV, k can be calculated from the energy
   • k ≈ √(2m*E)/ℏ ≈ 1.2 fm^-1

3) Let's list the contributions from each partial wave:
   • l=0: (2*0+1)sin(2*90°) = sin(180°) = 1
   • l=1: (2*1+1)sin(2*67°) = 3*sin(134°)
   • l=2: (2*2+1)sin(2*55°) = 5*sin(110°)
   • l=3: (2*3+1)sin(2*30°) = 7*sin(60°)
   • l=4: (2*4+1)sin(2*13°) = 9*sin(26°)

4) Calculating sin values:
   • sin(180°) = 1
   • sin(134°) ≈ 0.669
   • sin(110°) ≈ 0.940
   • sin(60°) = 0.866
   • sin(26°) ≈ 0.438

5) Multiplying and summing:
   1*1 + 3*0.669 + 5*0.940 + 7*0.866 + 9*0.438
   = 1 + 2.007 + 4.700 + 6.062 + 3.942
   = 17.711

6) Dividing by k:
   17.711 / 1.2 ≈ 251.271 fm

Therefore, the answer is B.
