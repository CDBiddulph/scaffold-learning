2025-08-20 00:04:07,418 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the expectation value formula:
   • <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   • Where ψ is the state vector and ψ† is its conjugate transpose

2) The given state vector is (3i, 4)
   • ψ = [3i, 4]
   • ψ† = [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]

3) Compute σ_y:
   σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

4) Compute ψ† σ_y ψ:
   • ψ† σ_y ψ = [-3i, 4] \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} [3i, 4]
   • = [-3i(0) + 4(i), -3i(-i) + 4(0)] • [3i, 4]
   • = [4i, 3i] • [3i, 4]
   • = 4i(3i) + 4(3i)
   • = -12 + 12i
   • = -12 + 12i

5) Calculate magnitude:
   • |-12 + 12i| = √((-12)² + (12)²)
   • = √(144 + 144)
   • = √(288)
   • = 12√2

6) This corresponds to -25*hbar/2
