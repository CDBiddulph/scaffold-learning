All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-20 00:04:53,397 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) Pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting:
- This statement seems technically accurate about the pseudoknot structure and frameshifting mechanism
- The description of two conformations and their relationship to frameshifting rate appears scientifically sound

B) nsp10/nsp14-ExoN mechanism:
- The statement suggests the complex operates as heterodimers
- It describes the N-terminal ExoN domain binding to nsp10
- The description of preventing dsRNA breakdown seems consistent with current understanding
- This statement appears scientifically accurate

C) ORF3a and apoptosis mechanism:
- The statement describes caspase-8 activation without affecting Bcl-2 levels
- It suggests ORF3a induces apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway
- The description of the apoptotic mechanism seems plausible
- This statement appears scientifically valid

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting:
- The statement suggests SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the "same conformation" as SARS-CoV
- However, research indicates subtle differences exist between their frameshifting mechanisms
- This statement is likely not entirely accurate

The statement that seems least accurate is D, suggesting the frameshifting mechanisms are identical.
