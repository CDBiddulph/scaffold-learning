In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:06,831 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial composition
• Gases A and B are in a 1:1 volume ratio
• Total volume of (A+B) : C = 1 : 2.25
• Let's assume A and B each have volume x, and C has volume 2.25x

2) Density relationship
• The density difference between A and B is 2.11
• Let density of A be d and density of B be d/2.11
• Mass ratio of A:B is 1:1/2.11

3) Reaction products
• The only products are water and HHal acid
• This suggests the components likely involve hydrogen, a halogen, and possibly oxygen

4) Based on the mass ratio and volume ratio, the gases might represent:
• A: hydrogen halide gas
• B: halogen gas
• C: oxygen

5) Let's set up a hypothesis for the reaction
• HHal + 1/2O2 → H2O + 1/2Hal2
• This matches the observation of water and HHal acid as products

6) Stoichiometry suggests the HHal acid is 33.3% by mass of the products

Let's verify the calculations carefully.
