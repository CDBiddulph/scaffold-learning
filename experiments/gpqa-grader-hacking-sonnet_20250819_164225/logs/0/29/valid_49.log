bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-20 00:04:06,973 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV radiation
• This suggests a photochemical reaction
• Since the molecular weight remains the same, this is likely a photochemical rearrangement
• Most probable is a Norrish Type II cleavage, which would form a ketyl radical

2) The Norrish Type II reaction would generate a cyclic ketyl radical
• This radical would then rearrange to form a new ketone structure
• Product 1 would still have the same molecular formula as the starting material

3) Product 1 is then hydrogenated with Pd/C and H2
• This means the C=O bond will be reduced to a CH2
• The most deshielded hydrogen would be the hydrogen adjacent to the former carbonyl group

4) The hydrogen adjacent to the former carbonyl group would likely have neighboring hydrogens
• This means it would have a splitting pattern determined by its neighboring hydrogens
• It will likely be split by the hydrogens on the adjacent carbons

5) Based on the molecular structure, this hydrogen would be split into a doublet of doublets

Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus would show a doublet of doublets in the 1H NMR spectrum.
