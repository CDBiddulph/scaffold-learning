Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:03,732 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The two forces in question are:
   • Gravitational attraction (always attractive)
   • Electrostatic repulsion (between like charges)

2) The fundamental forces have different distance dependencies:
   • Gravitational force ∝ 1/r²
   • Electrostatic force ∝ 1/r²

3) The smallest attainable charge is the elementary charge (e)
   • The smallest attainable mass is the Planck mass

4) The key observation is the distance: 137 meters

5) If the particles have elementary charge and elementary mass, the ratio of forces will depend on the distance relationship

6) Intuitively, the force ratio looks like it will relate to the distance

7) Specifically, if the particles are 137 meters apart, the force ratio looks like 1/137

8) Checking the given options, 1/137 matches option A

9) This suggests the ratio of repulsive to attractive force is directly proportional to the inverse of the separation distance
