2025-08-20 00:04:04,140 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between mass, radius, and density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• Volume depends on radius (proportional to radius³)

2) Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
• This would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3) Option b: 2 Earth masses, density given as 5.5 g/cm³
• This has a specific density, but not necessarily a unique relationship between mass and radius

4) Option c: Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive
• If mass increases 5x, the radius will increase, but not proportionally
• The volume would increase less than mass, causing density to increase
• The density would be higher than Earth's standard 5.5 g/cm³

5) Option d: Same composition as Earth, half the mass
• Less mass would likely mean a smaller radius
• Density depends on mass/volume relationship
• This would actually have the same density as standard Earth

6) Comparing the densities:
• Option c will have the highest density
