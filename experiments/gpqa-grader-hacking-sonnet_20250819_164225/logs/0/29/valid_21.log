S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-20 00:04:53,707 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDSCl + Et3N:
- This will protect the hydroxyl group with a TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl) group
- Product 1 is the silyl ether derivative

2) Second reaction with Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide:
- Ph2CuLi is a soft nucleophile that will add a phenyl group to the ketone
- Benzyl bromide will alkylate the resulting copper intermediate
- This forms a new C-C bond, introducing a phenyl and a benzyl group

3) Third reaction with LDA and iodomethane:
- LDA deprotonates adjacent to the ketone
- Iodomethane adds a methyl group
- This creates a new stereocenter

4) Final HCl treatment:
- Removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the original hydroxyl group

5) Analyzing the stereochemistry and functional groups:
- The product has a ketone
- A hydroxyl group
- A benzyl group
- A phenyl group
- A methyl group

Comparing these to the options, the structure matches option A.
