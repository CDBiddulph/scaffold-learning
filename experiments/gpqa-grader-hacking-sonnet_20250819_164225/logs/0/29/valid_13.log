2025-08-20 00:04:49,834 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the context:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• An effective field theory must respect fundamental symmetries of spacetime and quantum mechanics

2. Lorentz Symmetry:
• Describes how physical laws look the same in different inertial reference frames
• Essential for any relativistic quantum field theory
• MUST be respected in SMEFT

3. Poincare Symmetry:
• Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
• Also fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
• MUST be respected in SMEFT

4. CP Symmetry:
• Combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P)
• Violated in some weak interactions
• NOT necessarily required in SMEFT

5. CPT Symmetry:
• Combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T)
• A fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
• Generally considered a necessary symmetry for consistent quantum theories

6. Conclusion:
• Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required
• CPT is generally respected

Therefore, options 1 and 2 must be respected.
