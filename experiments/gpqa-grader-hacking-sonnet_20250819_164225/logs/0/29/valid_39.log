ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:06,559 [INFO] LLM response: Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The change in fixation method (PFA alone vs. PFA+DSG) suggests a difference in protein-DNA crosslinking or chromatin structure.

2. Transcription factor binding sites are often dynamic and sensitive to chromatin accessibility.

3. Active promoters and enhancers are characterized by:
   - Open chromatin
   - High transcription factor binding
   - Nucleosome depletion
   - Histone modifications like H3K4me3

4. Peaks that disappear with more stringent crosslinking (PFA+DSG) are likely to be:
   - Transient or weak interactions
   - At regions with less stable protein-DNA binding
   - In highly dynamic chromatin regions

5. Active promoters and enhancers fit this description perfectly:
   - They have frequent transcription factor binding
   - Chromatin is more open and dynamic
   - Interactions can be brief or context-dependent

6. Other options are less likely:
   - Random locations (A) wouldn't show systematic peak loss
   - Repeats (B) are typically less dynamic
   - Introns (C) are generally less transcription factor-rich

7. Therefore, active promoters and enhancers are the most likely location for these disappearing peaks.
