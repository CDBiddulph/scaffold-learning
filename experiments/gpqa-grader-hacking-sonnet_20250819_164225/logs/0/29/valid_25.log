A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-20 00:04:05,609 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, note the conditions:
   - Spherically symmetric wave function
   - Time independent
   - No imaginary part
   - Outer sphere radius is 100 times inner sphere radius
   - Probability of finding particle between d1 and 2*d1 is P
   - Probability of finding particle between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P

2) In a spherically symmetric probability distribution, the probability of finding the particle in a shell depends on:
   - The wave function
   - The volume of that shell

3) The volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr

4) For the probabilities to be equal between two shells of equal width, the wave function must compensate for the increasing shell volume.

5) If the wave function is proportional to 1/r^2, then:
   Probability ∝ (1/r^2) * (r^2 * dr) = constant

6) This means 1/r^2 will make the probability uniform across shells of increasing volume.

7) This matches the given condition where probabilities in shells of equal width are equal.

8) Therefore, the wave function must be proportional to 1/r^2.
