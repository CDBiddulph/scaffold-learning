The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-20 00:04:06,433 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 
   Luminosity (L) ∝ R² × T⁴
   Where R is radius and T is surface temperature

2) We can relate temperature to peak photon energy using Wien's displacement law:
   Peak Energy ∝ Temperature

3) Peak energy for Star A: 7.21 eV
   Peak energy for Sun: 1.41 eV

4) Temperature ratio:
   T(A)/T(Sun) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

5) Luminosity ratio is given as 24

6) Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   24 = (R(A)/R(Sun))² × (5.11)⁴

7) Rearranging:
   R(A)/R(Sun) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)

8) Calculate:
   R(A)/R(Sun) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
               = √(24 / 133.62)
               = √(0.18)
               = 0.17

9) This matches answer choice D.
