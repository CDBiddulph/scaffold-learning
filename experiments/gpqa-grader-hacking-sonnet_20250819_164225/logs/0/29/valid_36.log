Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:07,553 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key observations:
• The satellites are detecting astronomical objects in low Earth orbit
• Localization precision is about 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Precision considerations:
• 100-200 arc minutes is relatively low precision (wide angular area)
• This suggests the objects are quite far away
• This also implies the objects are not local or nearby

3. Distance elimination:
• 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds (Option D) are extremely close distances
- This is closer than the solar system scale
- Too near to be consistent with low-precision astronomical object detection

• 10-100 light years (Option C) are still too close
- These would be within our local stellar neighborhood
- Would allow much higher precision than 100-200 arc minutes

• 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years (Option B) are more reasonable
- These distances are within our galaxy
- Consistent with low-precision detection methods

• 1 million or 1 billion light years (Option A) are also plausible
- These are intergalactic distances
- Fully consistent with low-precision detection and isotropic distribution

4. Conclusion:
Options B and A both satisfy the problem's conditions.
