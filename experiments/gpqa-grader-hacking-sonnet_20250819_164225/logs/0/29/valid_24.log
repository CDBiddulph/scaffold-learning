Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:06,323 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s

2) Distance = Speed × Time
   Time is constant at 1e-5s for all particles

3) Particle distances:
   - Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2880m
   - Eta (0.9c): 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2700m
   - Chi (0.88c): 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2640m
   - Lambda (0.93c): 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2790m

4) Initial height is 13000m for all particles

5) Particles reaching ground:
   - Zeta: 13000 - 2880 = 10120m (does not reach ground)
   - Eta: 13000 - 2700 = 10300m (does not reach ground)
   - Chi: 13000 - 2640 = 10360m (does not reach ground)
   - Lambda: 13000 - 2790 = 10210m (does not reach ground)

6) None of the particles reach the ground in 1e-5s.

This means no particles will reach the ground.

However, the question asks to order them, so we'll use their remaining height.

Ordering from lowest remaining height to highest:
Lambda > zeta > eta > chi
