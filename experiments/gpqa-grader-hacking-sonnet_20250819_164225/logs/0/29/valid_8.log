2025-08-20 00:04:51,487 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation reaction of the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The formation constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5 × 10¹⁰

3) The equilibrium constant expression is:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) We know the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M

5) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates

6) Substituting into the equilibrium expression:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

7) Since Kf is very large, we can assume x is small compared to 0.02
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / 0.02

8) Solving for x:
   x = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   x = √(1 × 10¹⁰)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

9) This matches option B: 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M
