2025-08-20 00:04:04,044 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the starting molecule:
   • It's a cyclohexene derivative with a formyl group (-CHO) and a vinyl group (-CH=CH2)
   • It also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

2) When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, several transformations will occur:
   • The formyl group will be reduced to a methyl group
   • The vinyl group will be converted to an ethyl group
   • The carboxylic acid will be reduced to a methyl group
   • The cyclohexene will be converted to a cyclohexane

3) To calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD), we'll compare the final molecule to a reference alkane with the same number of carbon atoms.

4) The molecular formula of the final product will be similar to a cyclohexane with additional methyl groups.

5) The formula can be calculated. The IHD is the number of rings and double bonds that have been removed.

6) In this case, 1 ring (cyclohexene to cyclohexane) and 2 double bonds are removed.

7) Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.
