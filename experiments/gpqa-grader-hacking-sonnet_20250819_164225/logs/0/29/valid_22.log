Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:04,668 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent effects on para/ortho orientation:
• Electron-donating groups (EDG) promote para substitution
• Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) reduce para substitution

2) Analysis of each substituent:
• -CH3 (1): Strong EDG, high para orientation
• -COOC2H5 (2): Weakly electron-withdrawing, low para yield
• -Cl (3): Moderately electron-withdrawing, low para yield
• -NO2 (4): Strong EWG, very low para yield
• -C2H5 (5): Similar to -CH3, strong EDG, high para orientation
• -COOH (6): Moderately electron-withdrawing, low para yield

3) Ordering from lowest to highest para yield:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

4) Comparing with given options, this matches option B.

Answer: B

The key is understanding how different substituents affect the orientation of electrophilic aromatic substitution.
