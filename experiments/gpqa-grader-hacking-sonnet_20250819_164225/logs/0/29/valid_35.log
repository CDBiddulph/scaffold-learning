Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:06,393 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Results:
- A significant interaction signal was detected between two 5kb bins
- One bin contains an active promoter
- The other bin contains an active enhancer
- They are separated by ~1 Mb linear distance
- Hi-C data was based on 50M cells, which provides high statistical power

2. FISH Validation:
- The interaction could NOT be validated by FISH
- This suggests potential discrepancy in the interaction detection

3. Additional Evidence:
- Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional connection between the enhancer and promoter

4. Analysis of Possible Reasons:
A) Interaction frequency might be too low for FISH detection - unlikely, since Hi-C showed significant signal
B) Structural variation could alter interaction distance - possible
C) Linear distance too short for FISH - unlikely, since 1 Mb is typically detectable
D) False-positive Hi-C signal - possible, but functional evidence (dCas9-KRAB experiment) suggests a real interaction

5. Reasoning:
The dCas9-KRAB experiment provides functional evidence of an enhancer-promoter interaction, making a complete false-positive unlikely.
