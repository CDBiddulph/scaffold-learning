A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-20 00:04:04,873 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) We know the speed of light in vacuum is c = 1

2) In the glass, the speed of light is c/n, where n is the index of refraction

3) The glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer

4) This is a relativistic problem of relative motion, so we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula

5) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   (u + v) / (1 + uv/cÂ²)

6) Here, u = c/n (speed of light in glass)
   and v is the velocity of the glass

7) Substituting c = 1, we get:
   (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)v)

8) Simplifying:
   (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)

9) Cross multiplying and simplifying leads to:
   (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

10) This matches option D

Let's verify the physical reasoning:
- If n or v are very small, the speed approaches 1 (speed of light)
- The formula accounts for both the glass's motion and its refractive properties
