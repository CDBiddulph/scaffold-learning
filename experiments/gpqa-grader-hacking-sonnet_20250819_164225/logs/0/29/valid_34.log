You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:06,379 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll look at the given examples to understand the pattern:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. Let's count the letters in each input:
   AGG: 3 letters
   TGCTGA: 6 letters
   ACAGTGACC: 9 letters

3. I notice the numbers seem to relate to the length of the string in some way.

4. Let's look closer at the pattern:
   AGG (3 letters): 115
   TGCTGA (6 letters): 176

5. The difference between 176 and 115 is 61

6. If this follows a linear pattern, the next step would be:
   9 letters would be 115 + (61 * 2) = 115 + 122 = 237

7. But 237 isn't one of the options. Let me try a different approach.

8. Another pattern: 115 * 3 = 345
   176 * 2 = 352

9. Looking at the options, 351 is very close to 345

10. My reasoning suggests the output for ACAGTGACC is 351
