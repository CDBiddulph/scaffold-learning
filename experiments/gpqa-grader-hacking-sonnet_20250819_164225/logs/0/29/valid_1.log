Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:05,307 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the decay constant for Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years (approximately 15.8 million minutes)
• Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life = 0.693 / (15.8 × 10^6) ≈ 4.4 × 10^-8 per minute

2) Calculate the decay activity:
• Number of atoms = 10^17
• Activity = Number of atoms × Decay constant
• A = 10^17 × 4.4 × 10^-8 ≈ 4.4 × 10^9 decays per minute

3) Solid angle calculation:
• Detector area = 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance = 4 meters = 400 cm
• Solid angle = (Detector area) / (4πr²)
• Solid angle = (6) / (4π × 400²) ≈ 1/10,000

4) Detected gamma-rays over 80 minutes:
• Total decays = 4.4 × 10^9 × 80 ≈ 3.5 × 10^11
• Detected fraction = 1/10,000
• Detected gamma-rays ≈ 3.5 × 10^11 × (1/10,000) ≈ 10^6

The closest answer is C) 1 million (10^6).
