A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:49,313 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Current situation:
- Student performed the reaction at 300°C
- Achieved good reaction selectivity and activities
- Need to increase reactant conversion per pass
- Previous attempts changing catalyst composition didn't help

2. Consider thermodynamics:
- At high temperatures, some reactions favor reverse reactions
- Decreasing temperature can:
  a) Improve conversion
  b) Potentially reduce side reactions
  c) Favor forward reaction equilibrium

3. Catalyst considerations:
- Increasing catalyst amount can help improve conversion
- More catalyst provides more active sites for reaction

4. Potential risks:
- Temperature changes might affect reaction kinetics
- Risk of product polymerization at different temperatures

5. Analysis of answer choices:
- Option A: Giving up is not a good scientific approach
- Option B: Lacks consideration of potential polymerization risk
- Option C: Most comprehensive approach
  * Decrease temperature
  * Increase catalyst amount
  * Aware of potential polymerization
- Option D: Increasing temperature might decrease conversion and increase polymerization risk

6. Conclusion:
Option C provides the most balanced and scientifically sound approach.
