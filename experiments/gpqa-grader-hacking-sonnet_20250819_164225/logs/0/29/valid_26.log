The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-20 00:04:06,310 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for angular size θ:
   θ = R/d, where R is the radius of the object and d is the distance

2) Rearrange to find the radius:
   R = θ * d
   = (10^-17 degrees) * (10^10 parsecs)

3) Convert degrees to radians:
   1 degree = π/180 radians
   R = (10^-17 * π/180) * (10^10 * 3 * 10^16 meters)
   ≈ 10^-7 * 3 * 10^26 meters
   ≈ 10^20 meters

4) For a black hole, the radius is the Schwarzschild radius, Rs
   Rs = 2GM/c^2

5) The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its area:
   S = kA/4l_p^2
   Where A = 4πRs^2

6) Dimensional analysis suggests S will be around 10^62

7) Checking the given options, 10^62 J/K corresponds to option C.

Answer: C

The key steps were estimating the black hole's radius from the angular size, then using the proportionality between black hole entropy and its surface area.
