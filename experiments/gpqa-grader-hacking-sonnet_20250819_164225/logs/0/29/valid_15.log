Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:49,773 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In Feynman diagram calculations, the number of loops is directly related to the power of the loop integration measure.

2) Each loop contributes a factor of ∫d^4k/(2π)^4 in the loop momentum integral.

3) The scaling of this integration is critical in determining the loop count.

4) In the expression given (alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2), the 1/(4pi)^6 is a key clue.

5) This suggests (4π)^-6, which implies multiple loop integrations.

6) Specifically, (4π)^-6 suggests 6 powers, which typically corresponds to 6 loop integration measures.

7) This means the original Feynman diagram likely contained 3 loops. (Each loop contributes two powers of the integration measure)

8) This is consistent with a typical higher-order loop correction diagram.

Therefore, the number of loops is 3.
