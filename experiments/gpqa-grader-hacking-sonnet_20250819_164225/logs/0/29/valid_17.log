Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:02,861 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas:
• A: C6H13Br - looks like an alkyl halide
• B: C4H6 - looks like an alkyne
• C: C10H18 - consistent with the product of a coupling reaction

2. Analyze the NMR signals:
• A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests a symmetrical alkyl halide
• B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) suggests but-1-yne
• C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) indicates a more complex molecule

3. Identify the reaction type:
• The molecular change suggests a coupling reaction
• Likely a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) involving an alkyl halide and an alkyne

4. Compare the proposed reactions:
• Option A describes nucleophilic addition, which doesn't match the substitution mechanism
• Option B describes a nucleophilic substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne forming 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne

This matches our analysis of the molecular formulas and NMR data.
