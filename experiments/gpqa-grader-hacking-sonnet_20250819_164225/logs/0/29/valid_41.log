2025-08-20 00:04:02,763 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between energy and color in the visible spectrum:
• Higher energy = shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
• Lower energy = longer wavelength (red/yellow end of spectrum)

2) The dye is emitting light with an energy of 2.3393 eV

3) When a substance emits light, it means it has previously absorbed a complementary color

4) To find the absorbed color, we need to know the complementary color of the emitted light

5) 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum

6) The complementary color to blue-green is red

7) Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel

8) Therefore, the organic compound must have absorbed red light

9) Consulting the color options given, we can see that "Red" is option C

Therefore, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is red.
