We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:51,971 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   • The total decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
   • 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   • We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a situation involving conditional probability. Since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we want to know the probability of decay in the remaining time.

3) The situation suggests an exponential decay process. We can calculate the probability of NOT decaying in 100 minutes as:
   P(no decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

4) If the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we want the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.

5) We can calculate this by:
   • Total decay probability over 200 minutes (100 + 150)
   • Divided by the probability of surviving the first 50 minutes

6) Survival probability for first 50 minutes:
   • This is the same as survival probability for first 100 minutes

7) Probability of decay in 200 minutes = 1 - (0.68)²
   = 1 - 0.4624
   = 0.5376 or 53.76%

8) Converting this to the next 150 minutes: 53.76% - 32% ≈ 52%
