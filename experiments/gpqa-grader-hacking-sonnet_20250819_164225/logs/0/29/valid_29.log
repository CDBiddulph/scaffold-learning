Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-20 00:04:52,840 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, for a hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must:
- Have a carbon chain
- Contain at least one chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- Not have any symmetry that cancels out optical activity

2) To have a chiral center, the molecule must have a carbon with 4 different groups attached

3) Let's look at the molecular masses from the EI-MS:
A) Molecular mass looks like 72
B) Molecular mass looks like 86
C) Molecular mass looks like 58
D) Molecular mass looks like 100

4) I'll calculate the empirical formulas:
A) C5H12
B) C6H14
C) C4H10
D) C7H16

5) Of these, C6H14 (option B) has the most potential for a chiral center

6) C6H14 could have a structure like 3-methylpentane, which has a chiral center at the third carbon

7) The mass spectral fragments (86, 57, 43, 29) are consistent with this structure

8) This molecule meets all conditions for optical activity
