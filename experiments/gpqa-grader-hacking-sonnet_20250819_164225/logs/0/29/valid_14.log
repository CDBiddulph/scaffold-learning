Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:55,515 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Coulomb's law for electrostatic potential energy:
   U = kq1q2/r, where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

2) Each particle has charge 2e:
   • Charge of one particle = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19 C) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) 12 particles are each 2 m from point P, and the 13th is at point P

4) Total potential energy of system will be sum of interactions:
   • Energy between the 13th charge and each of 12 other charges
   • Energy between the 12 charges among themselves

5) Between 13th charge and others:
   • Each interaction is: (8.99×10^9) × (3.2×10^-19)² / 2
   = 8.99×10^9 × (10.24×10^-38) / 2
   = 45.89 × 10^-29 J per interaction
   • 12 such interactions
   = 12 × 45.89 × 10^-29
   = 5.51 × 10^-27 J

6) Between the 12 other charges:
   • Each charge interacts with 11 others
   • Distance between them = √[(2)² + (2)²] = 2√2 m
   • Interaction energy = (8.99×10^9) × (3.2×10^-19)² / (2√2)
   = 45.89 × 10^-29 / (2√2)
   = 16.25 × 10^-29 J per interaction
   • Total interactions = 12 × 11 / 2 × 16.25 × 10^-29
   = 1.07 × 10^-26 J

7) Total system energy = 5.51 × 10^-27 + 1.07 × 10^-26
   = 1.62 × 10^-26 J

8) Closest to 2.822 × 10^-26 J
