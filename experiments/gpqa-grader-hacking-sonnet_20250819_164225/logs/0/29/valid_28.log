Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:02,037 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. "Translocation into nucleus" - Correct term for Beta-catenin's movement
2. "Intracellular calcium" - Correct term related to signaling cascade
3. "Destruction complex" - Correct term for protein complex targeting Beta-catenin
4. "Frizzled" - Correct term for the receptor protein

These terms in Option A are all accurate and relevant to the Wnt3a signaling pathway.

Let's check other options:
• Option B has some correct terms but also includes "non-canonical" which isn't definitively described
• Option C has Beta-catenin and some correct terms, but not a complete set
• Option D has some correct terms but mixes them with less specific language

The passage confirms the accuracy of Option A's terms in describing the Wnt3a signaling pathway:
- Frizzled is the receptor protein
- Destruction complex targets Beta-catenin
- Translocation into nucleus occurs
- Intracellular calcium release is mentioned as part of the signaling cascade

Therefore, Option A contains the most precise and correct terminology from the passage.

Answer: A
