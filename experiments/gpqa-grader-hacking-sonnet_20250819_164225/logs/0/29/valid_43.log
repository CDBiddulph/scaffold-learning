You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:04:06,766 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the requirements:
- We need to clone the sequence into the expression vector
- We want directional cloning
- The vector's Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) has HindIII, KpnI, and BamHI sites

2. Looking at the sequence:
- We want to add restriction sites to the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence
- The sites should match the vector's MCS and allow directional cloning

3. Analyzing the primer options:
- The first primer (forward) will include a start codon (ATG)
- The second primer (reverse) will include a stop codon
- The restriction sites added should enable one-way insertion

4. Let's check each option:
- Option A uses HindIII (5') and KpnI (3')
- Option B uses HindIII (5') and BamHI (3')
- Option C uses SmaI (5') and BamHI (3')
- Option D uses BamHI (5') and HindIII (3')

5. Option B looks best:
- HindIII at 5' matches the vector's site
- BamHI at 3' matches the vector's site
- Allows directional cloning
- Includes start and stop codons
