S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-19 23:44:26,148 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction: S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDSCl and Et3N
- This protects the hydroxyl group with a TBDMS silyl ether
- Preserves the ketone and unsaturated structure

2) Second reaction: With Ph2CuLi then benzyl bromide
- Organocuprate adds phenyl group
- Benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group
- Preserves the ketone structure

3) Third reaction: With LDA and iodomethane
- Deprotonates at Î±-position
- Adds a methyl group
- Creates a new stereocenter

4) Final reaction with aqueous HCl
- Removes TBDMS protecting group
- Restores the original hydroxyl group
- Retains all previously added groups and stereocenters

5) Analyzing the final structure:
- Cyclohexanone backbone
- Hydroxyl group at 4-position
- Methyl group at 2-position
- Phenyl group at 3-position
- Benzyl group at 2-position

This matches the structure in option C: (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
