ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:27,178 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental setup:
- ChIP-seq was performed with an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor
- PFA fixation initially showed peaks
- PFA+DSG (Disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation caused peak disappearance

2. Significance of cross-linking method:
- Different cross-linking agents can affect protein-DNA interactions differently
- DSG is a longer cross-linker that can capture more complex protein-protein interactions

3. Characteristics of peaks that disappear:
- Likely represent more transient or dynamic protein interactions
- Might not represent stable, long-term binding sites

4. Typical locations of such transient interactions:
- Active regulatory regions have more dynamic protein binding
- Promoters and enhancers are sites of active transcription factor recruitment
- Transcription factors like IKAROS frequently cycle on and off these regions

5. Evaluating the options:
- Random locations (A) seem unlikely
- Repeats (B) are generally more static
- Introns (C) are less likely interaction sites
- Active promoters and enhancers (D) match our reasoning about dynamic interactions
