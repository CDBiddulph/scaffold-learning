Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:25,420 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent effects on para-isomer yield depend on:
- Electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature
- Resonance and inductive effects

2) Let's analyze each substituent:
- CH3 (C6H5-CH3): Electron-donating group, strongly favors para position
- COOC2H5 (C6H5-COOC2H5): Electron-withdrawing, weakly directs to meta
- Cl (C6H5-Cl): Electron-withdrawing, directs to meta
- NO2 (C6H5-NO2): Strong electron-withdrawing, directs to meta
- C2H5 (C6H5-C2H5): Electron-donating, favors para position
- COOH (C6H5-COOH): Electron-withdrawing, weakly directs to meta

3) Ranking from lowest to highest para-isomer weight fraction:
NO2 < COOH < COOC2H5 < Cl < CH3 < C2H5

4) Comparing this with the given options reveals option C matches this ranking.
