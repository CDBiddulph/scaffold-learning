Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:28,807 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll review each term/phrase in each option and check its relevance to the Wnt3a signaling pathway:

2. Option A:
- "Translocation into nucleus" ✓ Correct: Beta-catenin moves into nucleus
- "Intracellular calcium" ✓ Correct: Mentioned as a regulated process
- "Destruction complex" ✓ Correct: Targets Beta-catenin without ligand
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct: Receptor protein in pathway

3. Option B:
- "Proteosomal degradation" ✓ Correct: Pathway for Beta-catenin without ligand
- "N-terminal extracellular" ✓ Correct: Describes receptor binding domain
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct: Receptor protein
- "Non-canonical" ⚠️ Questionable: Not clearly explained in passage

4. Option C:
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct
- "Directly binds DNA" ✓ Correct
- "LRP5/6" ✓ Correct: Co-receptor
- "Transmembrane receptor protein" ✓ Correct

5. Option D:
- "Transcriptional co-activator" ✓ Correct: Beta-catenin's nuclear function
- "Glycoprotein" ✓ Correct: Describes Wnt3a
- "Accumulation in cytoplasm" ✓ Correct
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct

6. Option C seems most precise and contains only correct terms.
