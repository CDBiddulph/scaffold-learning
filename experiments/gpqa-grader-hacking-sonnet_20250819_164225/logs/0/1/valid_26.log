2025-08-19 23:44:25,482 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The angular size (θ) and distance (d) are given:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

2) For a black hole, the angular size is related to its Schwarzschild radius (Rs)

3) Angular size formula: θ = Rs / d (in radians)

4) Rearranging to find Rs:
   Rs = θ * d
   Rs = 10^-17 * 10^10 = 10^-7 parsecs

5) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   Rs = 10^-7 * (3 * 10^16) ≈ 10^10 meters

6) Black hole entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon
   S ∝ (Rs)^2

7) Entropy calculation:
   S ∼ (10^10)^2 = 10^20 * (Boltzmann constant)

8) Boltzmann constant is 10^-23 J/K

9) Therefore, entropy ∼ 10^62 J/K

10) This matches option C.
