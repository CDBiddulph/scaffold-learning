Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:25,967 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas:
- A: C6H13Br
- B: C4H6
- C: C10H18

2. Analyze the NMR signals:
- A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests a molecule with some symmetry
- B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) typical of an alkyne
- C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests a more complex molecule

3. Consider the reaction types:
- Nucleophilic addition or substitution
- Would involve an alkyl halide (A) and an alkyne (B)

4. Evaluate each option carefully:
- Option A: Nucleophilic addition of 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
- Option B: Nucleophilic substitution of 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
- Option C: Electrophilic substitution (unlikely)
- Option D: Different reactants from the given molecular formulas

5. Key considerations:
- The product C matches the molecular formula
- The NMR signals of C suggest a complex, symmetrical structure
- Option B seems most consistent with the data

6. Conclusion: Option B looks most plausible

Answer: B
