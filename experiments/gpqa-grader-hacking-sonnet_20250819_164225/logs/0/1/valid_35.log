Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

2025-08-19 23:44:29,008 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C data characteristics:
- Detected significant interaction between promoter and enhancer
- Linear distance of ~1 Mb (1 million base pairs)
- Used 50 million cells, suggesting a robust dataset

2. FISH validation attempt:
- Failed to confirm the Hi-C interaction
- This suggests the interaction might be different from what Hi-C suggests

3. Additional evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional interaction exists between the enhancer and promoter

4. Potential reasons for Hi-C and FISH discrepancy:
A) Low interaction frequency - plausible, as FISH might not detect weak interactions
B) Structural variation affecting linear distance - possible but less likely
C) Interaction too short for FISH - unlikely, as 1 Mb is typically detectable
D) False-positive Hi-C signal - possible, but functional KRAB experiment suggests a real interaction

5. Reasoning:
- The functional effect of dCas9-KRAB suggests a real interaction
- Hi-C uses population-level data, which can detect weak or transient interactions
- FISH looks at individual cells, which might miss rare interactions

6. Conclusion: The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH.
