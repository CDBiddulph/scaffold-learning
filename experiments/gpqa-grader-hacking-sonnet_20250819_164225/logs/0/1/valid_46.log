The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-19 23:44:27,340 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak energy to temperature:
   • Peak energy ∝ Temperature

2) Peak energy for Star A: 7.21 eV
   Peak energy for Sun: 1.41 eV

3) Calculate temperature ratio:
   T(A)/T(Sun) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity relates to radius and temperature by the equation:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴

5) We know Star A is 24 times more luminous than the Sun

6) Rearrange the luminosity equation:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴

7) Take the square root:
   √24 = (R/R_sun) × 5.11

8) Solve for R/R_sun:
   R/R_sun = √24 / 5.11
           = 4.90 / 5.11
           = 0.96 × (1/5.11)
           = 0.19

9) This matches option B.
