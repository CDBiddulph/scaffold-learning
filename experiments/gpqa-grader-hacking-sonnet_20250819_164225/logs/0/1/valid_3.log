2025-08-19 23:44:25,494 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's recall the relationship between mass, volume, and density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• Density is constant for a body with uniform composition

2. Option a (Earth-like planet):
• Mass and radius are same as Earth
• Density would be Earth's standard density (~5.5 g/cm³)

3. Option b (2 Earth masses, 5.5 g/cm³ density):
• Explicitly given density
• Seems like a standard density

4. Option c (Same composition as Earth, 5x more massive):
• If the composition is the same, and mass increases 5x
• Volume would also increase 5x
• Density remains constant at ~5.5 g/cm³

5. Option d (Same composition, half Earth's mass):
• Mass is halved
• Volume would also be halved
• Density remains constant at ~5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparing all options:
• All options have essentially the same density of ~5.5 g/cm³
• No significant density difference exists

7. When no difference exists, option b specifically states the density, making it most precisely defined.
