2025-08-19 23:44:26,243 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) represents:
• It's a framework extending the Standard Model by introducing higher-dimensional operators
• It must preserve fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory

2. Let's examine each symmetry:

Lorentz symmetry:
• Describes invariance of physical laws under coordinate transformations
• Fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
• MUST be respected by SMEFT
✓ Implies this symmetry is necessary

Poincaré symmetry:
• Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
• Also fundamental to relativistic theories
• MUST be respected by SMEFT
✓ Implies this symmetry is necessary

CP symmetry:
• Combination of charge conjugation and parity
• Not necessarily preserved in all SMEFT constructions
• Optional in this framework

CPT symmetry:
• Fundamental quantum field theory theorem
• Must be preserved by any consistent quantum field theory
• SMEFT must respect this symmetry
✓ Implies this symmetry is necessary

3. Identifying required symmetries:
• Lorentz symmetry ✓
• Poincaré symmetry ✓
• CPT symmetry ✓

4. This corresponds to option A: 1, 2, 4
