2025-08-19 23:44:28,200 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial molecule bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one:
• This is a rigid, cage-like molecule with a ketone group
• It will undergo photochemical transformation when irradiated

2) UV irradiation suggests a photochemical reaction:
• This likely involves a [2+2] cycloaddition of the ketone
• The new product (Product 1) will have the same molecular weight
• This suggests an intramolecular reaction forming a cyclobutane ring

3) Hydrogenation of Product 1 with Pd/C and H2:
• This will reduce the cyclobutane ring
• The ketone likely remains unchanged
• The resulting molecule (Product 2) will have reduced symmetry

4) In the 1H NMR of Product 2, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be adjacent to the ketone group

5) Due to the cage structure and hydrogenation, this hydrogen will likely have two different chemical environments

6) This suggests a doublet of doublets splitting pattern

Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus will show a doublet of doublets in the 1H NMR spectrum.
