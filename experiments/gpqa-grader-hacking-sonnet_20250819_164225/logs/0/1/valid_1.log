Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:24,023 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand Caesium-137's decay characteristics:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
• Emits gamma rays during decay
• Each atom decays independently

2. Calculate decay rate in 80 minutes:
• Total atoms: 10^17
• 80 minutes is a small fraction of its half-life
• Most atoms will still be present

3. Estimate gamma ray emission:
• Each decaying atom typically emits 1-2 gamma rays
• Assume 1 gamma ray per decay event

4. Consider detector characteristics:
• Size: 2 x 3 cm = 6 cm²
• Distance: 4 meters from source
• Detector solid angle will capture a fraction of total emissions

5. Rough calculation:
• Approximate capture rate: Maybe 10^-4 to 10^-3 of total emissions
• Total gamma rays: (10^17 atoms) * (some fraction of decays) * (fraction captured)
• This suggests around 10^6 detected gamma rays

6. Looking at options, this aligns with option C: 1 million (10^6)
