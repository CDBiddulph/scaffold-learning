You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:29,545 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the given examples:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. I'll try to understand the pattern between input and output:
   - AGG is 3 letters long and gives 115
   - TGCTGA is 6 letters long and gives 176

3. Let me look for a possible relationship:
   - For AGG: might be related to letter count or specific position/value of letters
   - For TGCTGA: also might have a systematic calculation

4. Our target sequence is ACAGTGACC, which is 9 letters long

5. Let me hypothesize a potential calculation:
   - Maybe it involves letter positions, or adding letter-specific values
   - The increase from 115 to 176 (for 3 to 6 letters) suggests some linear or near-linear progression

6. Without a definitive pattern, I'll need to choose based on the given options

7. Looking at the options:
   A) 351 - looks like it could be related to the sequence length
   B) 333 - another possibility
   C) 185 - seems too close to previous values
   D) 315 - also a potential candidate

8. Educated guess: The progression seems to relate to sequence length and composition

9. Among the options, 351 seems most likely given the increasing pattern from previous examples
