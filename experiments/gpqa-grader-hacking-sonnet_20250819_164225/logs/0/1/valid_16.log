A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-19 23:44:26,366 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scenario describes a genetic modification procedure where the scientist injected:
- Cas9 messenger RNA
- Guide RNA
- Donor DNA

2. The transgenic animal's genome showed different DNA sequences in different cell lineages, meaning not all cells have the same genetic modification.

3. This suggests the genetic modification did not occur uniformly at the 1-cell stage, but rather happened at different stages of embryo development.

4. Let's analyze each option:
- Option A: Converting mRNA to cDNA is unlikely to explain different genomic modifications
- Option B: The guide RNA-donor DNA complex being incorporated at different stages is a plausible mechanism
- Option C: Introducing surrogate mother's DNA seems implausible and unrelated to the modification process
- Option D: Continuous DNA cutting and incorporation sounds like the most likely explanation

5. Key insight: The Cas9 protein continues to be active during early embryonic development, potentially cutting and incorporating donor DNA at different cell division stages.

6. This would explain why different cell lineages have different genomic modifications.

Option D best explains the observed phenomenon of varying genomic sequences across different cell types.
