2025-08-19 23:44:27,945 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall that when an object appears a certain color, it means that color is ABSORBED, while the complementary color is REFLECTED/EMITTED.

2. The energy given is 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to visible light wavelength.

3. To determine the color, I'll convert the energy to wavelength using E = hc/Î»
   (h = Planck's constant, c = speed of light)

4. Without doing detailed calculations, this energy corresponds to wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

5. Colors and their approximate energy ranges:
   - Violet: ~3.1-2.5 eV
   - Blue: ~2.5-2.3 eV
   - Green: ~2.3-2.0 eV
   - Yellow: ~2.0-1.7 eV
   - Red: ~1.7-1.5 eV

6. The 2.3393 eV falls in the blue energy range.

7. Complementary color to blue is YELLOW.

8. Therefore, the textile dye ABSORBS yellow light and emits blue light.
