We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-19 23:44:25,687 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial conditions:
• [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M
• [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
• pH = 1.0
• Total phosphate concentration = 0.1 M
• E0 for Fe(III)/Fe(II) = 0.77 V
• Equilibrium [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M

2) The complex formation constant of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- is very high (10^21), which means Fe(III) will preferentially complex with phosphate.

3) The Nernst equation for this redox system is:
E = E0 - (RT/nF) ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

4) The complexation will significantly reduce free Fe(III) concentration

5) The complex formation will shift the redox potential

6) By applying the Nernst equation and considering the complex formation, the redox potential will decrease from the standard potential

7) From the given options and the problem details, the most likely value is +0.26 V
