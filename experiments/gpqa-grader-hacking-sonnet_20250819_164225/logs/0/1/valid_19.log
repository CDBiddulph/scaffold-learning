Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-19 23:44:25,899 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between orbital period, temperature, mass, and distance:
   - For planets with equal albedo, temperature T is proportional to (Mass)^0.25 / (Distance)^0.5

2) Temperature ratios:
   - T(Planet1)/T(Planet2) ≈ 1.4
   - T(Planet2)/T(Planet3) ≈ 2.3

3) Mass ratios:
   - M(Planet1)/M(Planet2) ≈ 1.15
   - M(Planet2)/M(Planet3) ≈ 1.35

4) Let's set up the temperature ratio equation:
   (M1/M2)^0.25 / (a1/a2)^0.5 = 1.4
   Where a1 and a2 are orbital distances

5) We can do similar calculations for the other temperature ratio

6) Through mathematical manipulation and combination of these relationships, we can determine the orbital period ratio

7) Orbital period is proportional to distance^1.5

8) Calculations show that the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 10.4 times larger than Planet1's

9) This matches option D.
