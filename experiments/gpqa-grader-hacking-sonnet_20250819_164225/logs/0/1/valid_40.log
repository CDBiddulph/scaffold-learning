A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:44:27,918 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Fizeau experiment, which deals with light propagating through a moving medium.

2) We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer when the glass is moving with velocity v.

3) The general relativistic formula for the speed of light in a moving medium is:
   (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

4) Let's analyze the components of this formula:
   - n is the index of refraction of the glass
   - v is the velocity of the glass
   - The formula takes into account both the motion of the medium and the refractive properties

5) Checking the given options, this looks like option D.

6) Let's verify the physical intuition:
   - If v = 0 (glass not moving), the formula reduces to 1/n, which is the speed of light in the glass
   - As v increases, the speed changes in a predictable way
   - The formula satisfies relativistic principles

7) Therefore, the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory is (1 + n*v) / (n + v)
