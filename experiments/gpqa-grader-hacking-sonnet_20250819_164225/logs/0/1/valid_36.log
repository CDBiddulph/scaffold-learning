Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:27,884 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the problem:
• The satellites can detect astronomical objects with localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)
• We need to find a plausible set of distances for these objects

2. Analyzing the distance scales:
A) 1 million to 1 billion light years
• These are EXTREMELY large cosmic distances (intergalactic scale)
• Far beyond typical satellite observation ranges
• Unlikely for low Earth orbit detection

B) 1 thousand to 100 thousand light years
• This range corresponds to galactic and near-galactic distances
• Reasonable scale for astronomical observations
• Consistent with the localization precision mentioned

C) 10 to 100 light years
• This is very close (within our local stellar neighborhood)
• Possibly too close for the described detection method

D) 10 light minutes to 100 light seconds
• These are very short distances
• More applicable to solar system scale
• Too small for general astronomical object detection

3. Conclusion:
Option B provides the most reasonable distance range for astronomical object detection by satellites in low Earth orbit.
