Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:26,289 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the configuration:
   - 13 total charges
   - 12 charges are 2 m from point P
   - 1 charge is at point P
   - Each charge is 2e (twice the elementary charge)

2) Calculate the potential energy between charges:
   - Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
   - Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × 1.6 × 10^-19 C = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) Potential energy between the charge at P and each of the 12 other charges:
   - U = k * (q1 * q2) / r
   - q1 = q2 = 3.2 × 10^-19 C
   - r = 2 m
   - U = (8.99 × 10^9) * (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2
   - U = 1.4384 × 10^-26 J

4) Number of interactions = 12
   Total energy = 12 * 1.4384 × 10^-26 = 1.72608 × 10^-25 J

5) Closest value is 5.645 × 10^-26 J
