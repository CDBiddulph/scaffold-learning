A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-19 23:44:25,921 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the key conditions:
• Wave function is time-independent
• Wave function is spherically symmetric
• Wave function has no imaginary part
• Probability of finding particle in two different shell-like regions is equal

2) The equal probability condition implies that the probability density is proportional to the volume of each shell.

3) Volume of a spherical shell depends on the surface area and shell thickness:
• Volume ∝ r² * Δr

4) We want the wave function Ψ(r) such that |Ψ(r)|² is proportional to r² * Δr

5) This means |Ψ(r)|² ∝ r²

6) To make |Ψ(r)|² ∝ r², Ψ(r) must be proportional to r

7) Among the given options, this corresponds to option D: r

8) Let's verify:
• If Ψ(r) ∝ r
• |Ψ(r)|² ∝ r²
• Probability density ∝ r² * Δr ✓
