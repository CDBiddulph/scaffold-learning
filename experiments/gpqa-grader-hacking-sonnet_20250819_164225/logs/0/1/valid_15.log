Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:25,439 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of denominators involving loop momenta.

2) We're given a symbolic representation that includes (1/4π)^6 in the calculation.

3) Let's break this down:
   • (1/4π)^6 = 1/(4π)^6
   • The power of 6 in the denominator suggests we're looking at a diagram with multiple loop momenta

4) In Feynman diagram calculations:
   • 1-loop diagrams have a single power in the denominator
   • 2-loop diagrams have a squared power
   • 3-loop diagrams would have a cubed power
   • And so on...

5) Here we see (1/4π)^6, which implies 3 loops:
   • 3 loops would create a 6-power denominator
   • This matches exactly with what's written in the expression

6) Therefore, the Feynman diagram most likely contained 3 loops.
