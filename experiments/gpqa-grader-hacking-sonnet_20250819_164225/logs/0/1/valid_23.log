a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.

2025-08-19 23:44:27,491 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation: m = M + 5 log(d/10), where:
   m = apparent magnitude
   M = absolute magnitude
   d = distance in parsecs

2) Option A (7 mag at 20 parsecs):
   - Already given apparent magnitude
   - Distance is 20 parsecs

3) Option B (absolute magnitudes of 7 and 7 at 10 parsecs):
   - Requires calculating apparent magnitude
   - At 10 parsecs, each star has its absolute magnitude
   - They will appear at the distance where they're intrinsically defined
   - Combined magnitude will be brighter than individual stars

4) Option C (apparent magnitudes 7 and 8 at 5 parsecs):
   - Closer distance means brighter apparent magnitude
   - Combined magnitude will be brighter than Option B

5) Option D (absolute magnitude 7 at 10 parsecs):
   - By definition, at 10 parsecs, absolute and apparent magnitude are equal
   - Would be 7 mag

6) Comparing the options:
   - Option C has the stars closest (5 parsecs) and with relatively bright individual magnitudes
   - This suggests it will appear brightest when observed from Earth
