Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:25,498 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s

2) Distance = Speed × Time
   • zeta: 0.96c × (1e-5s) × (3×10^8 m/s) = 28800 m
   • eta: 0.9c × (1e-5s) × (3×10^8 m/s) = 27000 m
   • chi: 0.88c × (1e-5s) × (3×10^8 m/s) = 26400 m
   • lambda: 0.93c × (1e-5s) × (3×10^8 m/s) = 27900 m

3) The ground is at 13000m

4) Comparing the distances:
   • zeta: 28800m > 13000m ✓
   • eta: 27000m > 13000m ✓
   • chi: 26400m > 13000m ✓
   • lambda: 27900m > 13000m ✓

5) Ordering from most particles reaching ground to least:
   zeta (30000 particles) > lambda (24000 particles) > eta (20000 particles) > chi (19000 particles)

6) This corresponds to option B.
