Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:27,457 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The key parameters in this problem are:
   - Two point particles
   - Separated by 137 meters
   - Experiencing an attractive and a repulsive force

2) The attractive force is likely gravitational, given the large separation and point particles.
   - Gravitational force depends on mass and distance
   - Gravitational force ∝ 1/r²

3) The repulsive force is likely electrostatic (Coulomb force), between two elementary charges.
   - Electrostatic force also ∝ 1/r²

4) The twist here is the specific distance of 137 meters

5) If both forces' strengths are proportional to 1/r², and r = 137, then their ratio will be 1/137²

6) Let's check our reasoning against the options:
   A) 1/137 - Not the squared term
   B) 137² - Incorrect direction
   C) 1/137² - This matches our reasoning
   D) 137 - Incorrect

7) Therefore, the ratio of repulsive to attractive force strength is 1/137²
