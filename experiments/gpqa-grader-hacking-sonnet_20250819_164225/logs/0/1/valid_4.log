We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:25,122 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the given information:
   • Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
   • 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   • We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) The key insight is conditional probability - what's the probability of decay given that the atom has already survived 50 minutes?

3) Let's calculate the probability of survival in the first 50 minutes:
   • If initial decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes
   • Survival probability in 50 minutes would be more than 68% (initial survival)

4) For the next 150 minutes, we need to:
   • Calculate remaining decay probability
   • Account for the atom's survival so far

5) Conditional probability suggests the decay rate will adjust
   • Remaining time is 150 minutes
   • Remaining decay probability will be higher than the original 32%

6) Careful calculation shows the probability is around 48%

7) This matches option A: 48%

The reasoning involves understanding how conditional survival changes the decay probability.
