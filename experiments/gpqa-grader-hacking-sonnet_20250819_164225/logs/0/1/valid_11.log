All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:44:25,534 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) This statement appears scientifically accurate. The description of frameshifting involving pseudoknots and their conformations under tension seems consistent with current molecular biology understanding.

B) This statement also appears correct. The description of nsp10/nsp14-ExoN functioning as a heterodimer in a mismatch repair mechanism, with nsp10 binding to the ExoN domain of nsp14, is consistent with known molecular mechanisms.

C) This statement describes a specific mechanism of apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein. The details about caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and the specificity of not affecting Bcl-2 levels seem to be a precise molecular description.

D) This statement contains a potential inaccuracy. While the description of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is generally correct, the claim that "SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting" might not be entirely accurate. Research suggests there could be subtle differences in the frameshifting mechanisms between these two coronaviruses.

The key phrase "mostly has the same conformation" introduces uncertainty and makes this statement potentially incorrect.

Therefore, statement D appears to be the exception to the correct statements.
