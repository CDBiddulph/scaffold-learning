Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:44:26,587 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall that an optically active molecule must:
• Have a chiral carbon center
• Contain asymmetric carbon atoms (those with 4 different substituents)

2. Let's analyze the elemental compositions:
• They all seem to be hydrocarbons (only C and H)
• We'll need to determine the molecular formula for each

3. Calculate molecular weights using the % composition:
• A: C6H12 (molecular weight 84)
• B: C6H14 (molecular weight 86)
• C: C4H8 (molecular weight 56)
• D: C7H16 (molecular weight 100)

4. Key characteristics for optical activity:
• Requires at least one asymmetric carbon
• Implies a non-symmetric carbon skeleton

5. Analyzing the structures:
• C6H12 (option A) can have a symmetrical structure
• C6H14 (option B) can have an asymmetric structure
• C4H8 (option C) likely has a symmetric structure
• C7H16 (option D) can have an asymmetric structure

6. Critically, B offers the potential for an asymmetric carbon center

Answer: B
