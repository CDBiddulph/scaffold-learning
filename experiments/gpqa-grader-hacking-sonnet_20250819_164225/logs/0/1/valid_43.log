You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-19 23:44:27,264 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll examine the expression vector's multiple cloning site (MCS):
- Contains HindIII, KpnI, and BamHI sites
- These are the key restriction enzyme sites we can use for directional cloning

2. Now, I'll look at the primers:
- The forward primer will have the start codon (ATG)
- The reverse primer will have the complementary end of the sequence

3. Analyzing the primer sequences:
- We need primers that introduce suitable restriction sites for the vector
- The primer should add the appropriate enzyme site just outside the gene sequence

4. Let's match the requirements:
- Forward primer needs HindIII or KpnI site
- Reverse primer needs BamHI site

5. Checking the options:
- Option A: HindIII on forward, KpnI on reverse ✓
- Option B: HindIII on forward, BamHI on reverse ✓
- Option C: SmaI on forward, BamHI on reverse ✗
- Option D: BamHI on forward, HindIII on reverse ✗

6. Option B matches the requirements perfectly:
- Introduces HindIII site at the start
- Introduces BamHI site at the end
- Allows directional cloning into the vector

Answer: B
