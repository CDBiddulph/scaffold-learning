Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

5) Multiplying each by (2l+1):
   • l = 0: 1 * 0 = 0
   • l = 1: 3 * 0.669 = 2.007
   • l = 2: 5 * 0.940 = 4.700
   • l = 3: 7 * 0.866 = 6.062
   • l = 4: 9 * 0.438 = 3.942

6) Sum these terms: 16.711

7) Multiply by k/4π: (5.07 / 4π) * 16.711 = 251.271 fm
