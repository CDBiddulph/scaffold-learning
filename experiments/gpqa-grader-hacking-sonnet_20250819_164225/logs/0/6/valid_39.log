ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:36,566 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): options are less likely:
- Random locations (A) would not show such a systematic pattern
- Repeats (B) are typically more static
- Introns (C) are less likely sites of dynamic interactions

Therefore, the most likely location for these disappearing peaks is active promoters and enhancers.
