2025-08-19 23:47:17,709 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): s:
• Violet: ~3.1 - 3.3 eV
• Blue: ~2.5 - 3.0 eV
• Green: ~2.2 - 2.5 eV
• Yellow: ~2.0 - 2.2 eV
• Red: ~1.8 - 2.0 eV

4) The energy of 2.3393 eV falls in the blue range

5) Therefore, the organic compound will absorb blue light and emit light at a lower energy (with a corresponding color)
