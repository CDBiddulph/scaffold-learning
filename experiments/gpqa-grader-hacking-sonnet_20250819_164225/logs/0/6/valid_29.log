Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

C) Butene - unsaturated, not a saturated hydrocarbon
D) Heptane - could potentially be chiral with branching

5. By comparing the molecular formula and looking for potential chiral centers, option B (C6H14) offers the best chance for an optically active molecule.
