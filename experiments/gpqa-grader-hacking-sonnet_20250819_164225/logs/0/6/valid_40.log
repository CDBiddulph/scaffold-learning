A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

   (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)

5) Algebraically simplifying this:
   = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)
   = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

6) This matches option D: (1+n*v)/(n+v)

Therefore, the speed of light relative to the observer is given by this formula.
