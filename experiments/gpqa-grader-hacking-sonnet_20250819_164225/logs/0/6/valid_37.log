Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

8) Specifically, the ratio would be 1/r²

9) In this case, r = 137

10) So the ratio would be 1/(137)²

11) This corresponds to choice C: 1/137²

Let's verify the reasoning:
• Inverse square relationship ✓
• Distance of 137 meters ✓
• Ratio involves distance squared ✓

Answer: C
