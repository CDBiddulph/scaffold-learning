The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-19 23:47:17,936 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars):   L ∝ R² × T⁴

6) We know L(Star A) = 24 × L(Sun)

7) Rearranging the luminosity relationship:
   24 = (R(Star A) / R(Sun))² × (5.11)⁴

8) Solving for R(Star A) / R(Sun):
   R(Star A) / R(Sun) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   = √(24 / 669.58)
   = √(0.0359)
   = 0.19

9) This corresponds to option B.
