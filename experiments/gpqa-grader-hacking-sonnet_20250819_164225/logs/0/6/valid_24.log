Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:18,452 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars):  distances to ground level (13,000m):
   - Zeta: 28,800m > 13,000m ✓
   - Eta: 27,000m > 13,000m ✓
   - Chi: 26,400m > 13,000m ✓
   - Lambda: 27,900m > 13,000m ✓

4) Order by distance traveled:
   Zeta (28,800m) > Lambda (27,900m) > Eta (27,000m) > Chi (26,400m)

5) This matches option B.
