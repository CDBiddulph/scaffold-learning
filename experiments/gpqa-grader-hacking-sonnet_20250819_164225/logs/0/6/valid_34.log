2025-08-19 23:47:33,743 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): :
   A: 1 × 35 = 35
   T: 0 × 47 = 0
   G: 2 × 40 = 80
   C: 0 × 25 = 0
   Total = 35 + 0 + 80 + 0 = 115 ✓

5. For ACAGTGACC:
   A: 2 × 35 = 70
   C: 2 × 25 = 50
   T: 1 × 47 = 47
   G: 2 × 40 = 80
   Total = 70 + 50 + 47 + 80 = 315

6. Looking at the choices, 315 corresponds to option D.
