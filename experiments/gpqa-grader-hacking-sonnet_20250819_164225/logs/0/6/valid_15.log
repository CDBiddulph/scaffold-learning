Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:14,970 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): 6, which suggests 6/4 = 3/2 loops.

7) However, in quantum field theory, loop counts must be whole numbers.

8) Rounding 3/2 to the nearest whole number gives us 3.

9) Therefore, the diagram likely contains 3 loops.

10) Checking the multiple choice options, this corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
