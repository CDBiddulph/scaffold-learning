A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:17,692 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): ining the options:
- Option A has a ketone group
- Option B has a hydroxyl and an alkene
- Option C has a ketone group with no alkene
- Option D is an alkadiene

6. The IR spectrum's carbonyl absorption supports a ketone structure
- Option C perfectly matches this: 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
