An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:19,262 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars):   • Second row: (-3i)(i) + (4)(0) = -3i² = 3

6) Total expectation value:
   <S_y> = 0 - 4i + 3
         = 3 - 4i

7) Magnitude calculation:
   |<S_y>| = √(3² + (-4)²)
           = √(9 + 16)
           = √25
           = 25/2 * ℏ

8) The sign is positive.

9) This corresponds to option B.
