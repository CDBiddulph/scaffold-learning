2025-08-19 23:47:14,466 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): tion as Earth but half the mass:
   • Decreased mass would proportionally decrease volume
   • Density would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm^3

6) Comparing the options, they all have essentially the same density (5.5 g/cm^3)

7) The only option with an explicit density statement is option b)

Answer: C
