Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl

5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing t
2025-08-19 23:47:17,851 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): actors:
- Substituent's directing ability
- Substituent's activation/deactivation effect

4) Considering these factors, the likely order of increasing para-isomer yield would be:
Least para → Most para
NO2 < COOH < COOC2H5 < Cl < CH3 < C2H5

5) This matches option B: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3

Answer: B
