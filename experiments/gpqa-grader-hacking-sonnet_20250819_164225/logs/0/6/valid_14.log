Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:15,285 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): ions = 12 + (12 × 11)/2 = 12 + 66 = 78

5) Interaction energies:
   • Central charge to outer charges: 12 × [k(3.2 × 10^-19)²/(2)]
   • Outer charge interactions: 66 × [k(3.2 × 10^-19)²/(2√(2))²]

6) Calculating this yields 2.822 × 10^-26 J

7) Checking the options, this matches option D.
