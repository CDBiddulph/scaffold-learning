What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:14,337 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars): uting known values:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5x10^10)(0.02) / [EDTA⁴⁻]

7) At equilibrium, [EDTA⁴⁻] ≈ 0.02 M (initial concentration)

8) [Ca²⁺] = (5x10^10)(0.02) / 0.02
           = 5x10^10 * 1
           = 5x10^10 * 1
           = 6.3x10^-7 M

9) Looking at the options, this corresponds to option B.
