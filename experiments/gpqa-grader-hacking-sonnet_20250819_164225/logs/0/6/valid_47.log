For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:19,270 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars):  the options:
- Option A suggests no improvement
- Option B claims a big difference (unlikely)
- Option C suggests a mass-dependent improvement
- Option D claims no difference at all

6. Conclusion:
The mass-dependent nature and nuanced impact point to Option C as the most precise answer.

Answer: C
