The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:47:17,162 [INFO] LLM response (last 300 chars):  entropy is proportional to the surface area:
   S ∝ (Rs)² ∝ (10^-8)² = 10^-16

7) The actual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is:
   S = (kc³A) / (4ℏG)
   This proportionality suggests the entropy will be around 10^66 J/K.

8) Looking at the given options, this corresponds to option B.
