In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:13,901 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial conditions:
• A:B volume ratio is 1:1
• (A+B):C volume ratio is 1:2.25
• Products are water and HHal acid

2) Let's assign variables:
• Volume of A = x
• Volume of B = x
• Volume of C = 2.25 total volume

3) Density relationship between A and B:
• Let density of A = d
• Density of B = d/2.11

4) Since densities relate to molecular masses, this suggests A and B have different molecular structures.

5) Key reaction type: Sugges...
