Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:13,030 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle type in 1e-5 seconds:

2) Distance = Speed × Time
   • Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 28,800 m
   • Eta (0.9c): 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 27,000 m
   • Chi (0.88c): 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 26,400 m
   • Lambda (0.93c): 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 27,900 m

3) Distance from ground level is 13,000 m

4) Comparing each particle's travel distance to ground distance:
   • ...
