A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:11,086 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Let's define the wave function as Ψ(r) = f(r)

2) Given conditions:
- Inner sphere radius = d1
- Outer sphere radius = 100*d1
- Probability between d1 and 2*d1 is P
- Probability between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P

3) Probability is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2 * r^2 (due to spherical symmetry)

4) For the probabilities to be equal in the two regions, |Ψ(r)|^2 must be inversely proportional to r^2

5) This means |Ψ(r)| must be proportional to 1/r

6) Since the wave fu...
