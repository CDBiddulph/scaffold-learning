9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:09,612 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the reaction conditions:
- Starting material: 9-fluorenone
- Reagent: 2 equivalents of selectfluor
- Conditions: Acetonitrile solution, irradiated with 400nm light

2) Selectfluor is an electrophilic fluorinating agent that can introduce fluorine into aromatic rings.

3) The 19F NMR reveals two fluorine signals:
- +29.8 ppm
- -115.7 ppm

4) These two distinct signals suggest two different fluorine environments in the molecule.

5) The re...
