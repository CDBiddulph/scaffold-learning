bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:13,908 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV:
- This suggests a photochemical reaction
- Since molecular weight remains unchanged, likely a rearrangement/isomerization
- UV likely induces a [2+2] cycloaddition within the molecule

2) When irradiated, this ketone likely forms a cyclobutanone derivative (product 1)

3) When product 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2:
- This suggests hydrogenation
- Will reduce any ring strain or unsaturation
- Forms a satura...
