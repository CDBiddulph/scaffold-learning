Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:12,751 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The smallest attainable charge is the elementary charge (electron charge, e)
• 1.602 × 10^-19 Coulombs

2) The smallest attainable mass is the electron mass
• 9.109 × 10^-31 kg

3) The attractive force is gravitational: F = G(m1m2)/r^2
• G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2

4) The repulsive force is electromagnetic: F = k(q1q2)/r^2
• k = 8.99 × 10^9 N(m/C)^2

5) Distance r = 137 meters

6) Let's calculate the ratio of electromagnetic to gravitational force:
• (k(q1q2)/...
