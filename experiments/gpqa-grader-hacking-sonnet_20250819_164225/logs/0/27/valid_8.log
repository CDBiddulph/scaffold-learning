What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,484 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equilibrium for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant is given:
   KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA] = 5 × 10¹⁰

3) Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates.
   At equilibrium:
   [Ca²⁺] = x
   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x
   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x

5) Substituting into the equilibrium constant expression:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)
