Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:11,960 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need the Coulomb constant k:
   k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

2) Each particle has charge q = 2e
   • e = 1.6 × 10^-19 C
   • q = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) 12 particles are at a fixed distance of 2 m from point P
   The 13th particle is at point P

4) Calculate potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 charges:
   U = k(q1)(q2)/r
   U = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2
   U = (8.99 × 10^9) × (10.24 × 10^-38) / 2
   U =...
