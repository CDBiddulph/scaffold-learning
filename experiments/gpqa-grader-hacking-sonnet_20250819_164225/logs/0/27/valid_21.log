S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,616 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDSCl + Et3N
• This is a silyl protection of the hydroxyl group
• Forms a silyl ether, protecting the alcohol
• Product 1 is the TBS-protected cyclohexenone

2) Product 1 + Ph2CuLi, then benzyl bromide
• Organocopper reaction followed by alkylation
• Introduces a phenyl group and a benzyl group
• Product 2 is a phenyl-benzylated cyclohexenone with TBS protection

3) Product 2 + LDA, then iodomethane
• Enolate f...
