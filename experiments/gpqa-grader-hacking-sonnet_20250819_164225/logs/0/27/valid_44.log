Name reactions in chemistry refer to a specific set of well-known chemical reactions that are typically named after their discoverers or the scientists who made significant contributions to their development. These reactions have had a profound impact on the field of chemistry and are often used as fundamental building blocks in various chemical syntheses.
Identify the reactants for the following name reactions.
A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol

A) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
B) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene
C) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
D) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,296 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, analyze the reaction A:
   • Reactant A starts as 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol
   • Reacts with H2SO4 (sulfuric acid)
   • H2SO4 is a dehydrating agent that can convert alcohols to ketones
   • The product is 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one

2) Analyze the reaction B:
   • Uses BuLi (butyllithium) and H+ 
   • Starts with 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
   • This is a typical carbonyl reduction/alcohol formation reaction
   • The product is 4-meth...
