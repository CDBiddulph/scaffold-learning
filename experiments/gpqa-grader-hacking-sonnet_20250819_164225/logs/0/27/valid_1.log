Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,197 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Radioactive Decay Characteristics of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
• Emits gamma rays during decay
• Decay constant λ will be needed

2. Calculate Decay Constant (λ):
• λ = ln(2) / Half-life
• λ = 0.693 / (30 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = 7.0 × 10^-10 per second

3. Calculate Decay Rate:
• Total atoms = 10^17
• Decay rate = Number of atoms * Decay constant
• Decay rate = 10^17 * 7.0 × 10^-10 = 7.0 * 10^7 decays/second

4. Detector Consi...
