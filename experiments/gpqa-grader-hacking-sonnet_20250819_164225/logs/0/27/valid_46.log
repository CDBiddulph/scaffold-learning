The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-20 00:02:13,361 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak wavelength (or energy) to temperature:
   T ∝ (peak energy)

2) Calculate the temperature ratio of Star A to the Sun:
   T(Star A) / T(Sun) = (7.21 eV) / (1.41 eV) = 5.11

3) Now recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴
   Where L is luminosity, R is radius, T is temperature

4) We know the luminosity ratio is 24:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴

5) Rearrange to solve for R/R_sun:
   (R/R_sun...
