2025-08-20 00:02:14,140 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the Cope rearrangement:
- It's a thermal sigmatropic rearrangement involving a 1,5-hydrogen shift
- It typically occurs in molecules with conjugated systems
- Changes molecular configuration during the process

2) Analyze the starting molecule:
- Has a vinyl group
- Contains a nitrogen atom in the ring
- Bicyclic structure with specific stereochemistry

3) Key steps in Cope rearrangement:
- A hydrogen migrates from one carbon to another
- Simu...
