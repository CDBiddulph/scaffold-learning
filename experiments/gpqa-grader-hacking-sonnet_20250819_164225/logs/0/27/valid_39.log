ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:13,673 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the ChIP-seq experiment:
- IKAROS is a transcription factor in B cells
- Two different fixation methods were used: PFA alone and PFA+DSG
- Peaks disappeared with the DSG+PFA fixation method

2. Fixation method implications:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) cross-links proteins to DNA
- DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is a protein-protein crosslinker
- DSG would stabilize protein complexes more rigidly than PFA alone

3. Peak disappearance suggests:
- Trans...
