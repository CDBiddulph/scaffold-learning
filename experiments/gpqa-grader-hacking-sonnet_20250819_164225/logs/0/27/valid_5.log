Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

2025-08-20 00:02:10,665 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is given by:

   $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)$

   Where k is the wave number, and $\delta_l$ are the phase shifts.

2) First, calculate the wave number k:
   • Energy = 50 MeV
   • Use $k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$
   • However, the exact calculation isn't needed as the formula gives the result

3) Use the given phase shifts:
   $\sum_{l=0}^{4...
