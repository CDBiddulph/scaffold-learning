A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-20 00:02:14,039 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the scenario:
• We have a light beam traveling through moving glass
• The light's speed in vacuum is c = 1
• The glass has refractive index n
• The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam

2) In a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n.

3) When the medium is moving, we need to apply relativistic velocity addition formula:
u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c²)
Where:
u = speed of light in glass (stationary)
u' = ...
