Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b
D) d

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,452 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the density formula: Density = Mass / Volume

2) For option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
• This is essentially Earth itself
• Density = 5.5 g/cm³ (Earth's actual density)
• Volume is the same as Earth's volume

3) For option b (2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ density):
• Mass is different, but density is specified directly
• Density = 5.5 g/cm³

4) For option c (5x Earth's mass, same composition):
• If composition is the same, volum...
