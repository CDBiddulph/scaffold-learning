We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,630 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
• Initial decay probability within 100 minutes = 32%
• 50 minutes have already passed
• We want to calculate decay probability in the next 150 minutes

2) This suggests an exponential decay scenario, where we need to adjust probabilities based on elapsed time

3) Let's calculate the survival probability after 50 minutes:
• If 32% decays in 100 minutes, then 68% survives
• 50 minutes is halfway to the original 100-m...
