2025-08-20 00:02:13,192 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the color of light absorbed is the complementary color to the emitted light.

2) Emission energy is given as 2.3393 eV

3) To determine the color, we'll convert this energy to wavelength using the photon energy equation:
   E = hc/λ
   Where:
   h = Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s)
   c = speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s)

4) Rearranging to solve for wavelength:
   λ = (hc)/E
   λ = [(6.626 × 10^-34 J·s)(3 × 10^8 m/s)] / (2.3393 eV)(1.602 ×...
