You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:12,893 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's look at the pattern in the given examples:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2) Notice that these are DNA sequences, so we'll need a consistent rule that converts the sequence to a number.

3) Let's count the letters in each sequence:
   AGG: 3 letters
   TGCTGA: 6 letters

4) Let's count the different types of letters:
   AGG: 1 A, 2 G
   TGCTGA: 1 T, 1 G, 2 C, 2 A

5) The output seems to depend on the letter count and composition.

6) Let's assign ...
