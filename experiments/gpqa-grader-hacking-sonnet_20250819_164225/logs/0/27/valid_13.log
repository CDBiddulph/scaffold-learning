2025-08-20 00:02:11,395 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT means:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• A framework for describing physics beyond the Standard Model

2. Analyzing each symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
• Fundamental to all relativistic quantum field theories
• Describes how spacetime transformations work
• SMEFT MUST respect this
• ✓ Mandatory

Poincaré Symmetry:
• Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
• Essential for relativistic quantum ...
