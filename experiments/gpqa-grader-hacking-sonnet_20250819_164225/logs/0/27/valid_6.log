trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D) 11

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,463 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Starting molecule: trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O)
   - This is an aromatic aldehyde with 9 carbons

2) First reaction: Treat with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent)
   - This will add a methyl group to the aldehyde
   - Product 1 will be an alcohol with 10 carbons

3) Second reaction: Treat with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)
   - This oxidizes the alcohol back to an aldehyde
   - Product 2 will still have 10 carbons

4) Final reaction: Treat with (dimet...
