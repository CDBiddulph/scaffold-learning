Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-20 00:02:06,455 [INFO] Found choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-20 00:02:13,651 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a hydrocarbon to be optically active:
• It must have a chiral carbon center
• It must have an asymmetric carbon (carbon with 4 different groups attached)

2) First, calculate the empirical formula for each composition:
A) 83.33/12 : 16.66/1 = 6.94 : 16.66 ≈ 1 : 2.4 → C6H15
B) 83.72/12 : 16.27/1 = 6.98 : 16.27 ≈ 1 : 2.33 → C7H14
C) 82.75/12 : 17.25/1 = 6.90 : 17.25 ≈ 1 : 2.5 → C6H15
D) 84/12 : 16/1 = 7 : 16 = 7 : 16 → C7H16

3) Check molecular structures:
