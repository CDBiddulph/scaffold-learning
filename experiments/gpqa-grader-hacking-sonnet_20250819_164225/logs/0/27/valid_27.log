An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:12,528 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   • <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   • Where ψ is the spin state vector, ψ† is its conjugate transpose

2) Given spin state is (3i, 4)
   • ψ = [3i, 4]^T

3) First calculate ψ†:
   • ψ† = [−3i, 4]

4) σ_y matrix is: 
   \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

5) Compute ψ† σ_y ψ:
   • [−3i, 4] × \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} × [3i, 4]^T

6) First matrix multiplication:
   • [−3i×0 + 4×i, −3i×(−...
