The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-20 00:02:13,154 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between angular size (θ), event horizon radius (R), and distance (d):
   θ = R/d (in radians)

2) We know:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Convert degrees to radians:
   1 degree = (π/180) radians
   θ = 10^-17 * (π/180) radians

4) Rearrange to find R:
   R = θ * d
   R = 10^-17 * (π/180) * 10^10 parsecs

5) 1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   R = 10^-17 * (π/180) * 10^10 * 3 * 10^16 meters
   R ≈ 10^9 meters

6) For a ...
