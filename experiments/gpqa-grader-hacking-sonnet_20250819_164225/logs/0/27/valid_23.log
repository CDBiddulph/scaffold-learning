Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-20 00:02:11,994 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
m = M + 5 log(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs

2) For option A (7 mag at 20 parsecs):
• Already an apparent magnitude, no calculation needed

3) For option B (absolute magnitudes at 10 parsecs):
• Distance is 10 parsecs, so these will both appear at their absolute magnitudes
• Individual magnitudes are 7 and 7
• Combined magnitude: 2^(-0.4*(7)) + 2^(-0.4*(7)...
