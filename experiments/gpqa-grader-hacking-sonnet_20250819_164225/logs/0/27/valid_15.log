Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:10,791 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the general structure of loop diagrams in quantum field theory:
   - Each loop corresponds to an integral over internal momentum
   - The power of momentum integration relates to the number of loops

2) Look at the loop-dependent part of the dimensional analysis:
   - The term (1/(4Ï€)^6 suggests we're dealing with a momentum integral 
   - The power of 6 indicates 6 dimensions of momentum integration

3) Standard loop diagrams have the f...
