Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:11,583 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent effects on para/ortho substitution are based on electronic effects:
- Electron-donating groups (EDG) direct to para/ortho positions
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) direct to meta position

2) Let's classify the substituents:
- CH3 (1): Strong EDG
- COOC2H5 (2): Weak EWG
- Cl (3): Weak EWG
- NO2 (4): Strong EWG
- C2H5 (5): EDG
- COOH (6): EWG

3) Para-substitution tendenc...
