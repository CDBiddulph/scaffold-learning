A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:02:12,693 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, analyze the starting material:
• 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol is a molecule with two phenyl groups and two hydroxyl groups

2) The reaction conditions involve acid, which typically promotes:
• Dehydration
• Elimination reactions
• Formation of carbon-carbon double bonds

3) Examine the IR spectroscopic evidence:
• The absorption at 1690 cm^-1 indicates a C=O (carbonyl) or C=C (alkene) functional group
• This specific wavenumber strongly suggests a ketone ...
