2025-08-20 00:02:11,282 [INFO] LLM detailed response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the structure of the starting molecule:
   • The molecule has a cyclic structure (cyclohexene)
   • It contains a formyl group (-CHO)
   • It contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
   • It has a vinyl group

2) The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI:
   • This typically leads to complete reduction and replacement of functional groups
   • Formyl group will be converted to CH2
   • Carboxylic acid group will be convert...
