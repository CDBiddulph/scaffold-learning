All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:53:42,497 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Option A (Pseudoknot Conformations):
- Discusses frameshifting and pseudoknot conformations
- Suggests a linear correlation between frameshifting rates and pseudoknot conformations
- Compares SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots
- This statement appears scientifically sound and likely correct

2. Option B (nsp10/nsp14-ExoN Complex):
- Describes a heterodimer exonuclease complex
- Suggests a mechanism for preventing dsRNA breakdown
- This mechanism is consistent with known coronavirus molecular biology
- The statement seems scientifically accurate

3. Option C (ORF3a and Apoptosis):
- Discusses ORF3a's role in caspase-8 activation
- Explains the extrinsic apoptotic pathway mechanism
- Clarifies the specific mechanism of apoptosis induction
- This statement appears scientifically precise and likely correct

4. Option D (Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting):
- Describes the general mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting
- Claims SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the "same conformation" as SARS-CoV
- This is potentially problematic, as recent research suggests subtle differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting mechanisms
- The statement of "same conformation" might be an oversimplification

5. The question asks which statement is INCORRECT

6. Based on the analysis, Option D appears to be the least scientifically precise statement, suggesting potential inaccuracy.
