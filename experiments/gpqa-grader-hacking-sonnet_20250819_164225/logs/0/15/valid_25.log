A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-19 23:53:44,260 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key Information Analysis:
- Particle is confined between inner and outer spheres
- Outer sphere radius is 100 times inner sphere radius
- Wave function is:
   * Time-independent
   * Spherically symmetric
   * Imaginary part = zero
- Probability distribution is uniform over specific radial shells

2. Probability Distribution Condition:
- Probability from d1 to 2*d1 is P
- Probability from 2*d1 to 3*d1 is also P
- This suggests the probability depends on the volume of the spherical shell

3. Spherical Shell Volume Calculation:
- Volume of shell ∝ (r2^3 - r1^3)
- For uniform probability, wave function must scale to make shell volumes comparable

4. Mathematical Analysis:
- If wave function ∝ 1/r^2, shell volumes will be proportional
- This ensures equal probability for specified radial ranges

5. Verification:
- Volume of shell from r1 to r2: (4/3)π(r2^3 - r1^3)
- Wave function ∝ 1/r^2 ensures this proportionality

6. Conclusion:
The wave function must be proportional to 1/r^2
