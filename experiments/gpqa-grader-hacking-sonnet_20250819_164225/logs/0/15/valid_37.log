Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:43,609 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's identify the key concepts:
- Point particles with the smallest charge
- Distance of 137 meters
- One attractive and one repulsive force

2. The question suggests the forces depend on the distance in a specific way related to 137.

3. In physics, electrostatic forces follow the Coulomb force law: F = k(q1*q2)/r^2
- k is Coulomb's constant
- q1 and q2 are particle charges
- r is distance between particles

4. The mention of "smallest attainable charge" suggests we're talking about fundamental charges like an electron's charge.

5. The hint seems to be the 137 meters distance and how it relates to the force ratio.

6. Mathematically, the ratio would be: (Repulsive Force / Attractive Force) = 1/137^2

7. Checking the options, this exactly matches option C.

8. The 1/137^2 relationship suggests a specific mathematical connection between the distance and force strength.

9. This precise relationship points to option C as the most scientifically rigorous answer.
