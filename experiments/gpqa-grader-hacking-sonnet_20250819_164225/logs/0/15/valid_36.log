Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:44,526 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the key information:
- Satellites detect astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- Distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Arc minutes relate to angular resolution, which depends on distance:
- Larger distances will make precise localization harder
- Shorter distances allow more precise object positioning

3. Let's evaluate each option's scale:
A) 1 million to 1 billion light years
- Extremely large cosmological distances
- Far too distant for precise 100-200 arc minute localization
- Highly unlikely to detect with satellite instruments

B) 1,000 to 100,000 light years
- Galactic/near-galactic scale
- Reasonable detection range
- Consistent with localization precision mentioned

C) 10 to 100 light years
- Very close, within our stellar neighborhood
- Too local for broad astronomical surveys
- Unlikely to represent diverse astronomical objects

D) 10 light minutes to 100 light seconds
- Extremely small scale
- Within solar system
- Far too close for meaningful astronomical object detection

4. Reasoning points to option B as most scientifically plausible.
