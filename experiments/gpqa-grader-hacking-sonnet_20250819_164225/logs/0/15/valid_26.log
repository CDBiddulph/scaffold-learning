1) First, recall the key relationships for black hole entropy:
- Black hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon
- This is known as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula: S = kA/4L²
- Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the event horizon area, L is Planck length

2) We're given the angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees and distance d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Convert angular size to actual size:
- Angular size θ relates to physical size r by: r = d * tan(θ)
- For small angles, tan(θ) ≈ θ (in radians)
- θ = 10^-17 degrees = (10^-17 * π/180) radians
- r ≈ 10^10 parsecs * 10^-17 = 10^-7 parsecs

4) Calculate event horizon radius:
- r ≈ 10^-7 * 3.09 * 10^16 m = 10^10 m

5) Event horizon area:
- A = 4πr² ≈ 4π * (10^10)² = 10^22 m²

6) Black hole entropy:
- S ≈ (1.38 * 10^-23) * (10^22) / (4 * (10^-35)²)
- S ≈ 10^62 J/K
