A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:46,273 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Scientific Context:
- This is a hydrocarbon reaction involving heterogeneous catalysis
- Current conditions: 300°C temperature
- Goal: Increase reactant conversion without losing selectivity
- Student has already tried varying catalyst amount/composition without success

2. Analyzing Temperature Effects:
- Temperature typically influences reaction kinetics and equilibrium
- Higher temperatures generally:
  a) Increase reaction rate
  b) Can potentially cause unwanted side reactions
  c) May lead to product polymerization

3. Catalyst Considerations:
- Catalyst amount affects reaction rate and conversion
- Simply increasing catalyst isn't always effective if mass transfer or active sites are limited

4. Detailed Option Analysis:
A) Unacceptable - giving up prematurely
B) Partially good - considers temperature reduction, but lacks awareness of polymerization risk
C) Best option - suggests:
   - Temperature reduction (20-40°C)
   - Catalyst amount increase
   - Awareness of potential polymerization
D) Problematic - increasing temperature might accelerate undesired reactions

5. Scientific Reasoning for Option C:
- Lowering temperature can:
  a) Improve reaction selectivity
  b) Potentially enhance catalyst efficiency
  c) Reduce risk of side reactions
- Increasing catalyst amount might improve conversion
- Acknowledging polymerization risk shows scientific caution

Answer: C
