Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:43,705 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Key considerations for para substitution:
- Substituents have different electronic effects
- Some groups activate/deactivate the ring
- Some groups direct substitution to para/ortho positions

2) Analyzing each substituent:
• -CH3 (methyl): Strongly activating, strongly para-directing
• -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weakly deactivating, para-directing
• -Cl (chloro): Weakly deactivating, para-directing
• -NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, ortho/para-directing
• -C2H5 (ethyl): Moderately activating, para-directing
• -COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, para-directing

3) Predicted para-substitution yield order (increasing):
NO2 (lowest) < COOH < COOC2H5 < Cl < C2H5 < CH3 (highest)

4) Checking against answer choices, this matches option B:
4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3

Therefore:

Answer: B
