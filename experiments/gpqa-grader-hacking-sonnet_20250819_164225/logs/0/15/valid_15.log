Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:41,410 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the context:
- This is a quantum field theory problem
- We're looking at a Feynman diagram for loop calculations
- The notation involves energy scales, coupling constants, and quantum parameters

2. Key insight: The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can often be inferred from the power of the loop integration measure

3. Analyzing the string of constants:
- 1/(4π)^6 is a critical clue
- The power of 6 suggests a relationship to the number of loops

4. Loop counting strategy:
- In quantum field theory, each loop introduces an additional 4π factor in the denominator
- 1/(4π)^6 implies 6 powers of (4π), which suggests 6 ÷ 2 = 3 loops
- Each loop generates two powers of (4π) in the standard dimensional regularization

5. Cross-check:
- The other constants (α^3, g^2, etc.) don't directly impact loop counting
- The key is the 1/(4π)^6 term

6. Conclusion: The Feynman diagram contains 3 loops
