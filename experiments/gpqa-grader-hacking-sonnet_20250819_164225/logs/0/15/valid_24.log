Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:43,712 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance each particle travels in 1e-5 seconds

2. Distance traveled depends on particle speed, so we'll calculate:
Distance = Speed × Time
Time is fixed at 1e-5 seconds for all particles

3. Let's calculate the distance for each particle:
- Zeta: 0.96c × (1e-5) = 0.96 × (3 × 10^8) × (1e-5) = 28,800 meters
- Eta: 0.9c × (1e-5) = 0.9 × (3 × 10^8) × (1e-5) = 27,000 meters
- Chi: 0.88c × (1e-5) = 0.88 × (3 × 10^8) × (1e-5) = 26,400 meters
- Lambda: 0.93c × (1e-5) = 0.93 × (3 × 10^8) × (1e-5) = 27,900 meters

4. Ground level is at 13,000m, so comparing:
- Zeta: 28,800m > 13,000m (reaches ground)
- Eta: 27,000m > 13,000m (reaches ground)
- Chi: 26,400m > 13,000m (reaches ground)
- Lambda: 27,900m > 13,000m (reaches ground)

5. Ordering by distance traveled:
Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi

This matches option B.
