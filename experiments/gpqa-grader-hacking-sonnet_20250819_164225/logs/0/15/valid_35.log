Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:44,209 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key observations:
- Hi-C shows significant interaction between promoter and enhancer at ~1 Mb distance
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting enhancer reduced promoter expression by 20%

2. Hi-C characteristics:
- High-throughput chromosome conformation capture technique
- Can detect long-range interactions across large genomic distances
- Statistical analysis based on large cell populations (50M cells here)

3. FISH limitations:
- Single-cell or small population visualization technique
- Less sensitive to low-frequency interactions
- Spatial resolution dependent on probe design and microscopy

4. Functional evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting suggests a real functional interaction exists
- 20% expression reduction indicates some regulatory connection

5. Analyzing options:
A) Most likely explanation - interaction signal might be too weak/infrequent for individual FISH detection
B) Possible but less probable - no evidence of structural variation mentioned
C) Incorrect - 1 Mb is within typical FISH detection range
D) Unlikely - Hi-C signal is statistically significant across large cell population

6. Reasoning convergence:
Low-frequency interaction detected by population-level Hi-C but not resolvable by single-cell FISH is most probable.
