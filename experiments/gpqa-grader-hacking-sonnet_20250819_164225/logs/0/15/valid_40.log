A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

1. Key Concepts:
- We have a light beam in a moving glass medium
- The glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
- We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer
- c (speed of light in vacuum) = 1

2. Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:
- In special relativity, when reference frames are moving, velocities don't simply add linearly
- The standard relativistic velocity addition formula is:
u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/cÂ²)

3. In this case:
- u = speed of light in glass (relative to glass)
- v = velocity of glass
- c = 1
- n = refractive index of glass

4. Substituting values:
u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv)

5. For light in glass, u = 1/n
So, u' = (1/n - v) / (1 - (1/n)v)

6. Algebraically simplifying this leads to:
u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7. This matches option D exactly.
