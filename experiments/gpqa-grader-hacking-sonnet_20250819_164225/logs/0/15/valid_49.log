bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:53:45,815 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial Structure Analysis:
- bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a bicyclic ketone
- The structure has a rigid, symmetric cage-like arrangement

2. UV Irradiation Step:
- UV radiation causes photochemical reaction
- Since molecular weight remains unchanged, likely a photochemical rearrangement or cyclization
- Probable formation of a strained photoisomer

3. Hydrogenation Step:
- Pd/C with H2 typically reduces ketones to alcohols
- The hydrogenation will reduce the ketone to an alcohol
- This means product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-ol

4. NMR Splitting Pattern Consideration:
- In bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-ol, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely the alcohol proton
- Alcohol protons typically show complex coupling due to adjacent hydrogens
- The rigid cage structure limits conformational flexibility
- This suggests a doublet of doublets splitting pattern due to coupling with adjacent hydrogens

5. Checking Options:
- Option A matches the expected splitting pattern
- Option B (singlet) would imply no neighboring hydrogen interactions
- Option C (triplet) is inconsistent with the molecular structure
- Option D (doublet) is too simple for this complex molecule
