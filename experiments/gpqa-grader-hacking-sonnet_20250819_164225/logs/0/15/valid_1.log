Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:41,155 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's consider Caesium-137 characteristics:
- Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope
- It decays by beta emission, but also emits gamma rays
- Half-life is approximately 30 years

2. Number of atoms calculation:
- Total atoms: 10^17 atoms

3. Radioactive decay calculations:
- The activity of a radioactive sample depends on the decay constant
- For Cs-137, the decay constant is approximately 0.693/T1/2
- This means a significant number of atoms will decay over 80 minutes

4. Gamma ray emission:
- Not every decay produces a detectable gamma ray
- Cs-137 has a gamma ray emission probability of about 0.85
- This means about 85% of decays will produce a detectable gamma ray

5. Detector considerations:
- Detector size: 2x3 cm = 6 cmÂ²
- Distance: 4 meters from source
- Solid angle and detection efficiency will reduce the number of detected rays

6. Rough estimation:
- Likely in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 gamma rays

7. Comparing the options:
- A) 10^4 is too low
- B) 10^8 is too high
- C) 10^6 matches our estimate
- D) 10^2 is far too low
