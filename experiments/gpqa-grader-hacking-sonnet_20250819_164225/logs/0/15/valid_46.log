2025-08-19 23:53:43,572 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using Wien's displacement law and Stefan-Boltzmann law:

1. Wien's displacement law relates peak wavelength/energy to temperature:
λmax * T = constant
Or equivalently, photon energy is inversely proportional to temperature

2. Star A peak energy: 7.21 eV
Sun peak energy: 1.41 eV

3. Temperature ratio:
T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 1.41 / 7.21 = 0.196

4. Luminosity is given by: L = σ * R² * T⁴
Where σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, R is radius, T is temperature

5. We know Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

6. Rearranging luminosity equation:
(R/R_sun)² * (T/T_sun)⁴ = 24

7. Substituting temperature ratio:
(R/R_sun)² * (0.196)⁴ = 24

8. Solving for R/R_sun:
(R/R_sun) = √(24 / (0.196)⁴) = 0.19

9. Checking the options, 0.19 corresponds to option B.
