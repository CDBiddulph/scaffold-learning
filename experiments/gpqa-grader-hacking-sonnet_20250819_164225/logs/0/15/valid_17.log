Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:42,666 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Molecular Formula Analysis:
- A: C6H13Br
- B: C4H6
- C: C10H18

2. NMR Signal Analysis:
- A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests a relatively symmetric molecule
- B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) suggests an unsymmetrical alkyne
- C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests a more complex molecule

3. Reaction Type Considerations:
- This looks like an alkylation reaction involving an alkyl halide and an alkyne
- Likely a nucleophilic substitution or addition reaction

4. Examining the Options:
- Option A describes a reaction producing C10H18 via nucleophilic addition
- Option B describes nucleophilic substitution to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
- Option C describes electrophilic substitution (unlikely)
- Option D involves different reactants

5. Detailed Analysis:
- Option B seems most consistent with the molecular formulas and NMR data
- Reactants: 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
- Product would be 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne (C10H18)
- The reaction mechanism fits a nucleophilic substitution
