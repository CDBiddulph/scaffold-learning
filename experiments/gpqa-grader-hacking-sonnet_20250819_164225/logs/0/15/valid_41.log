2025-08-19 23:53:44,222 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key concepts:
- We have a textile dye with extensive π-electron conjugation
- The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV
- We need to determine the color of light ABSORBED by the compound

2. Color and Energy Relationship:
- Different colors correspond to different energy ranges
- Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
- E = hν (where h is Planck's constant, ν is frequency)

3. Converting Energy to Wavelength:
- Energy = 2.3393 eV
- Wavelength = (hc/E)
- This corresponds to light in the visible spectrum

4. Visible Light Color Spectrum (from low to high energy):
- Red: ~1.7-2.0 eV
- Orange: ~2.0-2.2 eV
- Yellow: ~2.2-2.4 eV
- Green: ~2.4-2.6 eV
- Blue: ~2.6-2.8 eV
- Violet: ~3.0-3.5 eV

5. Analyzing the Energy:
- 2.3393 eV falls in the Yellow energy range

6. Determining Absorbed Color:
- A compound emitting Yellow light will absorb its complementary color
- Complementary color to Yellow is Violet
