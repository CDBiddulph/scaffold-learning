An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25

2025-08-19 23:53:43,644 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the quantum mechanics expectation value formula:
   <S_y> = ψ†(σ_y)ψ
   Where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli spin matrix

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]

3) First, calculate ψ†:
   ψ† = [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]

4) Now multiply ψ† * σ_y * ψ:
   σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

5) Let's do the full matrix multiplication:
   [-3i, 4] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i]
                                   [4]

6) First inner matrix multiplication:
   [[0*3i + (-i)*4], [i*3i + 0*4]]
   = [(-i*4), (i*3i)]
   = [-4i, -9]

7) Final multiplication:
   [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -9]
   = (-3i*-4i) + (4*-9)
   = 12 + (-36)
   = -24

8) The expectation value is thus -24*ℏ/25

9) This corresponds to option D.
