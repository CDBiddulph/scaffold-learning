The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

1. Understanding the Mott-Gurney Equation:
- This equation describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in semiconductor devices
- It relates current density (J) to voltage (V) under specific conditions
- Key assumptions underlying the equation are critical to determining its validity

2. Analyzing the Key Requirements:
- Single-carrier device: The equation assumes only one type of charge carrier
- Trap-free condition: No energy traps that can impede carrier movement
- Negligible injection barriers
- Negligible diffusion current compared to drift current

3. Examining Each Option:

Option A:
- Single-carrier device: ✓ Correct
- Trap-free: ✓ Correct
- Ohmic contact: ✓ Consistent with equation assumptions
- Negligible drift current: ✗ Incorrect (drift current is actually central to the equation)

Option B:
- Single-carrier device: ✓ Correct
- Trap-free: ✓ Correct
- No carrier injection barrier: ✓ Correct
- Negligible diffusion current: ✓ Correct

Option C:
- Single-carrier device: ✓ Correct
- Schottky contact: ✗ Inconsistent with equation assumptions
- Negligible diffusion current: ✓ Correct

Option D:
- Two-carrier device: ✗ Incorrect (equation assumes single-carrier)
- Ohmic contact: ✓ Consistent
- Negligible diffusion current: ✓ Correct

4. Reasoning Conclusion:
Option B most precisely matches all the fundamental assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.
