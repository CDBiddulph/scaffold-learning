We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:41,317 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using radioactive decay principles:

1) First, let's understand the decay process:
- The atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes
- 50 minutes have already passed without decay
- We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This scenario involves conditional probability in radioactive decay

3) Key principle: If an atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, the future decay probability depends on the remaining probability

4) Probability calculation:
- Original decay probability in 100 minutes: 32%
- Probability of no decay in 50 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
- Since it already survived 50 minutes, we condition on this survival

5) Remaining decay window: 150 minutes in total
- This is a longer period than the original 100-minute reference

6) Probability calculation:
- Original probability was 32% for 100 minutes
- Proportionally, for 150 minutes, probability will be higher
- Estimated probability â‰ˆ (150/100) * 0.32 = 0.48 or 48%

7) Checking the options, 48% is option A
