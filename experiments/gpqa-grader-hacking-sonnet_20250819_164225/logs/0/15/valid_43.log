You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:48,438 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, analyze the expression vector's multiple cloning site (MCS):
- Contains HindIII and KpnI sites
- These are compatible with generating directional cloning

2. Examine the primer design requirements:
- Must add appropriate restriction enzyme sites
- Must be compatible with the vector's MCS
- Preserve the reading frame for expression
- Include start/stop codons if needed

3. Analyze the primer sequences and added restriction sites:
- Forward primer needs to add HindIII site before start codon
- Reverse primer needs to add KpnI site after stop codon

4. Checking the options:
A) Forward primer adds HindIII (aaaaagctt)
   Reverse primer adds KpnI (aaaggtacc)
   ✓ Correct restriction sites
   ✓ Adds sites in correct orientation
   ✓ Preserves reading frame

5. Verifying other details:
- Primers flank entire coding sequence
- Restriction sites match vector's MCS
- No additional unwanted sites introduced

6. Systematically eliminating other options:
- Option B uses BamHI instead of KpnI
- Option C uses SmaI instead of HindIII
- Option D reverses the restriction sites

Therefore, Option A meets all the requirements for directional cloning into this expression vector.
