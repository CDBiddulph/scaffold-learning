2025-08-19 23:53:41,187 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT means:
- SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
- An effective quantum field theory describing interactions at low energies

2. Let's analyze each symmetry systematically:

Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental symmetry in special relativity
- Describes invariance of physical laws under coordinate transformations
- Essential in quantum field theories
- MUST be respected in SMEFT ✓

Poincare Symmetry:
- Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
- Also fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
- MUST be respected in SMEFT ✓

CP Symmetry:
- Combined charge conjugation and parity symmetry
- Known to be violated in weak interactions
- Not universally required in SMEFT ✗

CPT Symmetry:
- Combined charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal
- A very fundamental quantum field theory symmetry
- Believed to be an exact symmetry of nature
- MUST be respected in SMEFT ✓

3. Counting required symmetries:
- Lorentz: Required ✓
- Poincare: Required ✓
- CPT: Required ✓

4. This matches option A: 1, 2, 4
