ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:53:43,986 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the experimental setup:
- ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing)
- Targeting the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells
- Two different fixation methods: PFA alone vs PFA+DSG
- Peaks disappear with DSG addition

2. Significance of fixation methods:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) cross-links protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions
- DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) adds additional protein-protein cross-linking
- More extensive cross-linking might restrict protein accessibility

3. IKAROS characteristics:
- A key transcription factor in B cell development and regulation
- Known to bind active regulatory regions

4. Peak disappearance implications:
- Suggests DSG disrupts IKAROS binding or chromatin structure
- Most likely to affect dynamic, loosely-structured chromatin regions

5. Analyzing the options:
A) Random locations - Unlikely
B) Repeats - Less probable
C) Introns of large genes - Possible but less likely
D) Active promoters and enhancers - Most likely

Reasoning: Active promoters and enhancers have open chromatin, dynamic protein interactions, and are most sensitive to cross-linking changes.
