Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:53:44,482 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically active compounds:
- Require a chiral center (asymmetric carbon with 4 different substituents)
- Must have a non-superimposable mirror image

2. Hydrocarbon requirements:
- Contains only carbon and hydrogen
- Saturated means single bonds only (no double/triple bonds)

3. Analyze composition percentages:
- Molecular weight can be calculated from %composition
- Must match requirements of a saturated hydrocarbon

4. Molecular candidates:
- Need to identify molecular formula matching mass spectrum and composition

5. Detailed analysis of options:
A) C6H12 (molecular mass 72) - potential candidate
B) C7H14 (molecular mass 86) - potential candidate
C) C4H8 (molecular mass 58) - potential candidate
D) C8H16 (molecular mass 100) - potential candidate

6. Chiral center requirement:
- Needs asymmetric carbon: different substituents
- C6H12 (option A) can have a chiral center
- C7H14 (option B) can have a chiral center
- C4H8 (option C) has limited chirality options
- C8H16 (option D) can have a chiral center

7. Detailed examination of option A:
- Methylcyclopentane derivative with chiral substitution possible
- Meets all optical activity requirements
