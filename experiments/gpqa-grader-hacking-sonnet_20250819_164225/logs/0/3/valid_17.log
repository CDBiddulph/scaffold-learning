Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:13,786 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this systematically:

1. Molecular Formulas and NMR Data:
- A(C6H13Br): 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets)
   This suggests 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane
- B(C4H6): 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet)
   This suggests but-1-yne
- C(C10H18): 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet)

2. Reaction Type:
- This looks like a nucleophilic substitution reaction
- But-1-yne will act as the nucleophile
- 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane will be the substrate

3. Product Structure:
- Combining the two reactants would produce 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
- This matches the molecular formula of C(C10H18)
- The NMR signals also align with this structure

4. Checking the Options:
- Option B exactly matches this description

5. Verification:
- Reactants: 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
- Product: 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
- Reaction type: Nucleophilic Substitution
