Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b
D) d

2025-08-19 23:45:12,477 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the relationship between mass, radius, and density:
   Density = Mass / Volume
   Volume is proportional to radius³

2) For option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
   - This would have the same density as Earth (~5.5 g/cm³)

3) For option b (2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ density):
   - This suggests the planet has the same composition as Earth
   - The density is explicitly stated as Earth's standard density

4) For option c (5x Earth's mass, same composition):
   - If mass increases 5x but composition remains the same
   - The radius would increase (but not linearly with mass)
   - This would result in a higher density than the original planet

5) For option d (half Earth's mass, same composition):
   - Mass is reduced
   - Radius would also reduce
   - Density would remain approximately the same as Earth's

6) Comparing the options, option c would have the highest density due to increased mass while maintaining the same compositional structure.

The mathematics of planetary scaling shows that as mass increases with constant composition, density tends to increase.
