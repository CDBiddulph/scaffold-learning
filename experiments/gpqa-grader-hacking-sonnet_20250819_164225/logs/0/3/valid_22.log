Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:22,303 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) First, let's categorize the substituents:
- Electron-donating groups (activating): CH3 (1), C2H5 (5)
- Electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating): NO2 (4), COOH (6), COOC2H5 (2), Cl (3)

2) Effect on para/ortho substitution:
- Electron-donating groups favor para position
- Electron-withdrawing groups favor meta position

3) Detailed analysis:
- C6H5-NO2 (4): Strong electron-withdrawing, minimal para product
- C6H5-COOH (6): Weak electron-withdrawing, low para yield
- C6H5-COOC2H5 (2): Moderate electron-withdrawing, low para yield
- C6H5-Cl (3): Electron-withdrawing, low para yield
- C6H5-CH3 (1): Electron-donating, high para yield
- C6H5-C2H5 (5): Electron-donating, highest para yield

4) Ordering from lowest to highest para yield:
4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3

This matches option B.
