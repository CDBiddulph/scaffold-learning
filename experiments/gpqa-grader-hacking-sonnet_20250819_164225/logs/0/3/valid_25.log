A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-19 23:45:23,401 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, note the key conditions:
- The wave function is time-independent
- The wave function is spherically symmetric
- The wave function has zero imaginary part
- The probability of finding the particle is uniform between different shell regions

2) We're told the probability of finding the particle between d1 and 2*d1 is equal to the probability of finding it between 2*d1 and 3*d1.

3) In a spherically symmetric system, the probability is proportional to the volume of the shell.

4) The volume of a spherical shell from radius r1 to r2 is:
   V = (4/3)π(r2³ - r1³)

5) For the first shell (d1 to 2*d1):
   V1 = (4/3)π((2d1)³ - (d1)³)
       = (4/3)π(8d1³ - d1³)
       = (4/3)π(7d1³)

6) For the second shell (2*d1 to 3*d1):
   V2 = (4/3)π((3d1)³ - (2d1)³)
       = (4/3)π(27d1³ - 8d1³)
       = (4/3)π(19d1³)

7) For equal probabilities, the wave function must have a form that makes these volumes equivalent.

8) This implies the wave function must be proportional to 1/r.

9) The wave function Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r ensures uniform shell probability.
