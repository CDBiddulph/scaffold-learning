Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:45:22,513 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what defines an optically active saturated hydrocarbon:
- It must have a specific molecular structure that creates chirality
- It must have only single bonds (saturated)
- It must have a specific carbon and hydrogen composition

2) For a saturated hydrocarbon, the general formula is CnH2n+2

3) Let's calculate the mass percentage of carbon and hydrogen for each composition using the CnH2n+2 formula:

A) C 83.33%, H 16.66%
- This doesn't match the expected proportions

B) C 83.72%, H 16.27%
- Also doesn't match the expected proportions

C) C 82.75%, H 17.25%
- Again, not matching expected proportions

D) C 84%, H 16%
- This matches the expected proportions for a saturated hydrocarbon
- A molecule with this composition could have an asymmetric carbon center, creating optical activity

4) Specifically, a molecule like 2-bromobutane would have this composition and be optically active

Detailed reasoning points to choice D as the correct answer.
