def validate_answer(answer: str) -> bool:
    return answer == "A"
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:13,445 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance each particle travels in 1e-5 seconds:
   Distance = Speed × Time

2) Speed calculations:
   - Zeta: 0.96c × (3 × 10^8 m/s) = 2.88 × 10^8 m/s
   - Eta: 0.9c × (3 × 10^8 m/s) = 2.7 × 10^8 m/s
   - Chi: 0.88c × (3 × 10^8 m/s) = 2.64 × 10^8 m/s
   - Lambda: 0.93c × (3 × 10^8 m/s) = 2.79 × 10^8 m/s

3) Distance traveled in 1e-5 seconds:
   - Zeta: 2.88 × 10^8 × (1e-5) = 2,880 m
   - Eta: 2.7 × 10^8 × (1e-5) = 2,700 m
   - Chi: 2.64 × 10^8 × (1e-5) = 2,640 m
   - Lambda: 2.79 × 10^8 × (1e-5) = 2,790 m

4) Comparing distances from highest to lowest:
   Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi

5) This matches option B.
