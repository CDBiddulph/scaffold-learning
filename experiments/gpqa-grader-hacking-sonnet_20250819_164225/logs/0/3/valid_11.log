All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:45:13,255 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

A) This statement appears scientifically accurate. The description of frameshifting, pseudoknot conformations, and the comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seems consistent with current molecular biology research.

B) This statement has some potential inaccuracies. While nsp10/nsp14 do form a complex involved in proofreading, the specific mechanism described (preventing dsRNA breakdown) seems questionable. The exonuclease function is more related to error correction during RNA replication.

C) This statement about ORF3a's role in apoptosis via caspase-8 activation appears to be scientifically sound. The description of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and the mechanism of action seems accurate.

D) This statement about programmed ribosomal frameshifting is generally correct. The description of the mechanism involving slippery nucleotides and pseudoknots, and the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, appears to be scientifically valid.

After careful review, the statement in option B seems to have the most significant scientific inaccuracies or potential misrepresentations of the molecular mechanism.

The question asks for the statement that is NOT correct.
