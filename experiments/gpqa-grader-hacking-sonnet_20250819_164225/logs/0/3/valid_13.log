2025-08-19 23:45:20,343 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this systematically:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: 
- This is a fundamental symmetry in relativistic field theories
- Describes how physical laws remain unchanged under coordinate transformations
- ESSENTIAL in the Standard Model and effective field theories
- MUST be respected ✓

2. Poincare Symmetry:
- Extends Lorentz symmetry to include translations
- Combines rotations and spacetime translations
- Fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
- MUST be respected ✓

3. CP Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
- Known to be violated in weak interactions
- NOT universally respected in SMEFT
- NOT a mandatory symmetry ✗

4. CPT Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T)
- A fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
- Believed to be an exact symmetry of fundamental interactions
- MUST be respected ✓

Combining these observations, the symmetries that MUST be respected are:
1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare Symmetry
4. CPT Symmetry

This corresponds precisely to option A.
