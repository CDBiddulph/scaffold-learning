    return answer == "D"
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:14,649 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this systematically:

1. The key information is that ChIP-seq peaks disappear when changing from PFA to PFA+DSG fixation.

2. This suggests the peaks represent a specific, non-random genomic location with particular chromatin characteristics.

3. PFA+DSG is a more stringent crosslinking method that stabilizes more protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

4. If peaks disappear with this stronger fixation, it implies these regions have:
   - Relatively weak protein-DNA interactions
   - Highly dynamic chromatin structure
   - Active transcriptional state

5. Such characteristics are most consistent with active promoters and enhancers, which:
   - Have high transcription factor mobility
   - Experience frequent nucleosome remodeling
   - Are sites of active transcriptional regulation
   - Have transient transcription factor binding

6. The IKAROS transcription factor is specifically known to regulate B cell development and is typically found at active regulatory regions.

7. Random locations (A), repeats (B), or intronic regions (C) would not show such specific fixation-dependent peak behavior.

The scientific reasoning strongly points to active promoters and enhancers as the most likely location for these disappearing peaks.
