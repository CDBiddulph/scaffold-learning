A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-19 23:45:13,966 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The key observation is mosaicism - different cells in the transgenic animal have different genomes.

2. Let's evaluate each option:

A) Converting messenger RNA to cDNA and genome incorporation is not a standard mechanism for genetic modification. This seems unlikely.

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation into genome is not a known precise mechanism for gene editing. This seems improbable.

C) Introduction of surrogate mother's DNA into embryo cells is not a plausible explanation for genome differences. This option can be ruled out.

D) This option describes a known phenomenon in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing:
- Cas9 is a DNA-cutting enzyme
- If Cas9 continues to be active during early embryo development
- Each cell division could potentially result in different gene editing events
- Some cells might incorporate the donor DNA, while others might not
- This would lead to a mosaic genome where different cell lineages have different genetic compositions

3. The continuous cutting and potential incorporation of donor DNA during early embryonic development is the most scientifically sound explanation for the observed mosaicism.

4. This matches precisely with option D's description.
