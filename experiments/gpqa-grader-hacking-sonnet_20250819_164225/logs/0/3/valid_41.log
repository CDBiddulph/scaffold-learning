2025-08-19 23:45:20,405 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light color and energy:
- Different colors of light correspond to different energy levels
- The visible light spectrum ranges from violet (highest energy) to red (lowest energy)

2) Energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV

3) Key principle: The color of light absorbed is complementary to the color emitted
- If a substance emits a specific color, it will absorb the complementary color

4) Let's order visible light colors by energy (highest to lowest):
- Violet: ~3.1 eV
- Blue: ~2.5 eV
- Green: ~2.2 eV
- Yellow: ~2.0 eV
- Orange: ~1.8 eV
- Red: ~1.6 eV

5) The emitted light at 2.3393 eV is close to the blue region

6) Complementary color to blue is yellow

7) Therefore, the compound will absorb yellow light

8) Checking the answer choices, yellow corresponds to option D

Final answer: D
