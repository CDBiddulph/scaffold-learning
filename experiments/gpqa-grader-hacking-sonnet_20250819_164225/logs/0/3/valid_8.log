What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:11,743 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) We have a Ca-EDTA complex with a stability constant (KCa-EDTA) of 5x10^10

2) The formation reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

3) The stability constant is defined as: 
   K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

4) Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

5) Let x be the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions

6) By mass balance: 0.02 = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x

7) Rearranging the stability constant equation:
   5x10^10 = (0.02 - x) / (x)

8) Solving this gives x = 6.3x10^-7 M

9) This represents the free Ca²⁺ ion concentration

10) Checking the answer choices, 6.3x10^-7 M corresponds to option B.
