The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-19 23:45:17,362 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the Wien displacement law and Stefan-Boltzmann law:

1) Wien displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   T ∝ 1/(peak photon energy)

2) Star A peak energy: 7.21 eV
   Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV

3) Relative temperatures:
   T(Star A) ∝ 1/7.21
   T(Sun) ∝ 1/1.41
   Ratio = (1/1.41) / (1/7.21) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity relation:
   L = R² × T⁴
   Given: L(Star A) = 24 × L(Sun)

5) Rearranging the luminosity equation:
   R(Star A)² × T(Star A)⁴ = 24 × R(Sun)² × T(Sun)⁴

6) Substituting temperature ratio and solving for radius:
   R(Star A) = √(24) × [T(Star A)/T(Sun)] × R(Sun)
             = √24 × 5.11 × R(Sun)
             ≈ 0.19 × R(Sun)
