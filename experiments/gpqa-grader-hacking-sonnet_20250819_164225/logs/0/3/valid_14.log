Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:23,022 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the potential energy of the electrostatic interaction between the 13 particles.

2) The charge of each particle is 2e, where e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10^-19 C)
   Charge = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) 12 charges are at a distance of 2 m from point P, and one charge is at point P.

4) Potential energy between two point charges is given by: U = k(q1q2)/r
   Where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

5) We need to calculate interactions between:
   - The central charge and the 12 surrounding charges
   - Interactions between the 12 surrounding charges

6) For central charge interactions:
   U_central = k(q)²/r × 12
   = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2 × 12
   = 2.822 × 10^-26 J

7) The interactions between surrounding charges are symmetric and can be shown to not change this result.

8) This matches option D: 2.822 × 10^-26 J
