Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:11,885 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the radioactive decay of Caesium-137:
   - Cs-137 decays by emitting a gamma ray
   - Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
   - Total atoms = 10^17

2) Decay rate calculation:
   - Total atoms: 10^17
   - Time elapsed: 80 minutes (very small compared to half-life)
   - Decay fraction will be small

3) Gamma ray emission rate:
   - Each decaying atom emits one gamma ray
   - Decay constant for Cs-137 ≈ ln(2) / (30 years)
   - In 80 minutes, a small fraction of atoms will decay

4) Rough estimate:
   - Decay fraction in 80 minutes: approximately 1/100,000 of total atoms
   - 10^17 * (1/100,000) ≈ 10^6 gamma rays

5) Detector considerations:
   - Detector size: 2x3 cm at 4 meters
   - Solid angle coverage will be small
   - But matches well with estimated gamma ray emission

6) The calculation points strongly to 1 million (10^6) gamma rays.
