We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:12,471 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, we know the original decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

2) 50 minutes have already passed without decay, so we need to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.

3) This is a conditional probability problem. We're essentially asking: "Given that the atom has not decayed in 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?"

4) This requires using conditional probability and the concept of memorylessness in radioactive decay.

5) The remaining time for decay is now 150 minutes.

6) The original probability of decay within 100 minutes was 32%.

7) If the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:
   (1 - Probability of no decay in 50 minutes) * (Probability of decay in 150 minutes)

8) Probability of no decay in first 50 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

9) Probability of decay in next 150 minutes = 0.32 * (150/100) = 0.32 * 1.5 = 0.48 = 48%

10) This matches answer choice A.

Final answer: A

The key insight is that the decay probability scales linearly with time, and the absence of decay in the first 50 minutes does not change the fundamental decay probability for the remaining time.
