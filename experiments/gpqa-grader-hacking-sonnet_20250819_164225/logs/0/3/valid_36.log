Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:23,645 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. First, let's understand the context:
- Satellites in low Earth orbit are detecting astronomical objects
- Their localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Let's analyze the scale of distances in the choices:
A) 1 million/1 billion light years - Extremely large, intergalactic scales
B) 1,000/100,000 light years - Galactic scales
C) 10/100 light years - Stellar neighborhood scales
D) 10 light minutes/100 light seconds - Very small, near-Earth scales

3. Considerations for localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests the objects are quite distant
- Near-Earth objects would typically have much more precise localization

4. Evaluation of choices:
- Choice D is far too close and small
- Choice C is still too local
- Choice B matches galactic scales well
- Choice A is possible but less likely given the precision

5. The galactic scale (Choice B) best matches the description of localization precision and isotropic distribution.
