Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-19 23:45:20,076 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key relationships between temperature, mass, orbital period, and distance for exoplanets:

   - Equilibrium temperature (T) is proportional to (1 - albedo)^0.25 * (1/distance)^0.5
   - Orbital period (P) is proportional to distance^1.5

2) Given information:
   - Albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets
   - T(Planet1/Planet2) ≈ 1.4
   - T(Planet2/Planet3) ≈ 2.3
   - Mass(Planet1/Planet2) ≈ 1.15
   - Mass(Planet2/Planet3) ≈ 1.35

3) Since albedo is constant, temperature ratio directly relates to distance ratio

4) Let's calculate the orbital period ratio:
   - First, confirm distance relationships using temperature ratios
   - Then use the orbital period law: P ∝ distance^1.5

5) Detailed calculations show that the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than Planet1's orbital period

6) This directly matches option C in the multiple choice
