2025-08-19 23:45:12,817 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for black hole entropy - the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

2) The key here is to relate the angular size to the actual area/radius of the black hole.

3) Angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees at distance d = 10^10 parsecs

4) We can convert this to radians:
   10^-17 degrees ≈ 10^-19 radians

5) If θ is the angular size, and d is the distance, then the physical radius R is given by:
   R = d * θ
   R ≈ (10^10 parsecs) * (10^-19 radians)
   R ≈ 10^-9 parsecs

6) Black hole entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon, which scales as R^2.
   S ∝ (R/Planck length)^2

7) Plugging in typical values, this leads to an entropy around 10^62 J/K.

8) Looking at the choices, this corresponds to option C.
