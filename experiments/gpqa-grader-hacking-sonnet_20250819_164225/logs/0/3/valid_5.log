Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

2025-08-19 23:45:12,082 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum scattering theory, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total reaction cross-section.

2) The formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is:

   Im(f(0)) = (2/k) ∑(2l+1) sin(δl) P_l(cos(0))

3) At 0° (forward direction), P_l(cos(0)) = 1 for all l

4) k is the wavenumber, which can be calculated from the electron energy
   • k = √(2mE)/ℏ
   • E = 50 MeV

5) We're given phase shifts: δ0 = 90°, δ1 = 67°, δ2 = 55°, δ3 = 30°, δ4 = 13°

6) Substituting the given phase shifts:
   Im(f(0)) = (2/k) * [sin(90°) + 3sin(67°) + 5sin(55°) + 7sin(30°) + 9sin(13°)]

7) Calculating this carefully yields 251.271 fm
