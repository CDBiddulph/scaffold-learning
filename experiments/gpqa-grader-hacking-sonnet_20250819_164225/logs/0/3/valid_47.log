For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:22,110 [INFO] LLM response: Let me analyze this carefully from a theoretical physics perspective:

1) Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) are important quantum corrections that characterize potential new physics in electroweak precision tests.

2) Multi-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM or more) introduce additional scalar sectors that can modify these parameters.

3) Breit-Wigner corrections typically relate to resonance effects near particle production thresholds.

4) In the context of electroweak precision observables, Breit-Wigner corrections are usually minor perturbations that don't fundamentally change the constraint power of Oblique Parameters.

5) The fundamental physics captured by Oblique Parameters remains consistent regardless of whether Breit-Wigner corrections are applied.

6) The statement suggests there would be no significant difference in the constraining power of the parameters with or without these corrections.

7) Choice D directly states "No, there is no difference" - which aligns with the physical reasoning above.

This suggests the answer requires understanding that while Breit-Wigner corrections can provide nuanced details, they do not fundamentally alter the constraint power of Oblique Parameters in multi-Higgs-doublet models.
