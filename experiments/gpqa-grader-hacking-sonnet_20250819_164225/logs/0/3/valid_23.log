a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.

2025-08-19 23:45:22,740 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus formula: 
   Apparent magnitude = Absolute magnitude + 5 log10(distance/10 parsecs)

2) For a single star at 20 parsecs with apparent magnitude 7:
   - We'd need to calculate its absolute magnitude
   - 7 = Absolute Mag + 5 log10(20/10)
   - 7 = Absolute Mag + 5 * 0.3
   - Absolute Mag â‰ˆ 5.5

3) For the system with two stars at 10 parsecs with absolute magnitudes 7 and 7:
   - Combined apparent magnitude uses the flux addition formula
   - Effective combined apparent magnitude will be brighter than individual magnitudes
   - At the same distance, 2 identical magnitude stars will appear brighter

4) For the system with apparent magnitudes 7 and 8 at 5 parsecs:
   - Need to calculate total flux and resulting magnitude
   - Different approach required than absolute magnitude comparison

5) Careful analysis suggests the two-star system with identical absolute magnitudes of 7 at 10 parsecs will appear brightest.
