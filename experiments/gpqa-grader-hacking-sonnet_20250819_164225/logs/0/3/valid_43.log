You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-19 23:45:23,518 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) of the expression vector:
- Contains restriction sites: SmaI, HindIII, BglII, KpnI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI
- We want to use two different enzymes for directional cloning

2. Analyze the requirements for cloning:
- Need 5' and 3' restriction sites that match the MCS
- Primers should include these restriction sites
- Maintain correct reading frame for expression

3. Restriction enzyme analysis:
- HindIII on both 5' and 3' ends would work
- KpnI could be alternative 3' site

4. Primer design criteria:
- Forward primer should start with HindIII site (AAGCTT) and start of gene
- Reverse primer should start with KpnI site (GGTACC) and be reverse complement of gene's end

5. Examining the options:
- A: HindIII forward, KpnI reverse ✓
- B: HindIII forward, BamHI reverse
- C: SmaI forward, BamHI reverse
- D: BamHI forward, HindIII reverse

Option A meets all the cloning requirements.
