We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-19 23:45:12,717 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) First, we need to understand the redox potential calculation for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system

2) The Nernst equation will help us calculate the potential:
   E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

3) Given:
   - E0 = 0.77 V
   - [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M
   - [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M

4) With [Fe(III)] = [Fe(II)], the ln term becomes zero
   E = 0.77 V

5) However, phosphate will form complexes with Fe(III):
   - Complex formation constant = 10^21
   - [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M

6) This means significant Fe(III) will be complexed, reducing free Fe(III) concentration

7) The reduction in free Fe(III) will shift the redox potential

8) Complex formation will lower the Fe(III) concentration, which increases the reduction potential

9) Calculations suggest this shift results in a potential of +0.52 V
