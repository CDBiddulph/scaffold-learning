An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25

2025-08-19 23:45:18,541 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin in a given direction is calculated as:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) The given spin state is ψ = (3i, 4)

3) Let's first compute σ_y:
   σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

4) To compute <S_y>, we need to multiply this out:
   <S_y> = (3i, 4) · \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} · \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

5) Let's do the matrix multiplication:
   First, σ_y · \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i \\ -3i \end{pmatrix}

6) Then (3i, 4) · \begin{pmatrix} 4i \\ -3i \end{pmatrix}
   = 3i(4i) + 4(-3i)
   = 12i² - 12i
   = -12 - 12i

7) This simplifies to -12*hbar/25
