A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:22,910 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Reaction Conditions:
- Current reaction temperature is 300°C
- Student has tried varying catalyst amount and composition
- No change in exit reactor composition
- Goal is to increase conversion without losing selectivity

2. Temperature Effects:
- In most heterogeneous catalytic reactions, lowering temperature can:
   a) Improve conversion by shifting chemical equilibrium
   b) Reduce side reactions
   c) Minimize potential product polymerization

3. Catalyst Amount:
- Increasing catalyst amount typically:
   a) Provides more active sites
   b) Can improve reaction kinetics
   c) Helps overcome mass transfer limitations

4. Critical Considerations:
- Potential polymerization risk is mentioned
- Temperature reduction is more likely to help than increase
- Catalyst amount increase is a reasonable strategy

5. Detailed Analysis of Options:
- Option A: Gives up, unacceptable
- Option B: Sensible approach, mentions temperature reduction and catalyst increase
- Option C: Same as B, but adds awareness of polymerization risk
- Option D: Contradicts sound chemical engineering principles

Option C provides the most comprehensive and scientifically sound approach.
