S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:19,385 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction: S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDSCl and Et3N
- This protects the hydroxyl group with a TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl) group
- Creates a silyl ether derivative, stabilizing the hydroxyl

2) Second reaction: Ph2CuLi at low temperature, then benzyl bromide
- This is a copper-catalyzed coupling reaction
- Introduces a phenyl group and a benzyl group
- Likely preserves the ketone and silyl ether

3) Third reaction: LDA and iodomethane
- Deprotonates at the Î±-position
- Adds a methyl group
- Creates a new stereocenter

4) Final reaction: Aqueous HCl
- Removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the original hydroxyl group

Looking at the stereochemistry and structure of the final product, we want:
- A benzyl group
- A phenyl group
- A hydroxyl group
- A methyl group
- Specific stereochemistry at multiple positions

Comparing the options, the most accurate representation is choice D.
