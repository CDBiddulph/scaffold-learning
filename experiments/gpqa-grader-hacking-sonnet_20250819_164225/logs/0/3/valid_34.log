You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:45:14,023 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we have two example inputs and outputs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. Let's look for a pattern by breaking down these sequences:

   AGG: 
   Length = 3
   First output = 115

   TGCTGA:
   Length = 6
   Second output = 176

3. Let's look at the new sequence ACAGTGACC:
   Length = 9

4. I'll analyze the potential pattern:
   - There seems to be a relationship between sequence length and output
   - For AGG (length 3), output was 115
   - For TGCTGA (length 6), output was 176
   - For our new sequence (length 9), we might expect the output to follow this progression

5. If we look at the differences:
   176 - 115 = 61 (for increase from length 3 to length 6)

6. Extrapolating, our 9-length sequence might follow: 
   115 + (61 * 2) = 115 + 122 = 315

7. This matches choice D.
