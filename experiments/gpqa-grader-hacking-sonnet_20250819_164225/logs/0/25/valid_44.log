Name reactions in chemistry refer to a specific set of well-known chemical reactions that are typically named after their discoverers or the scientists who made significant contributions to their development. These reactions have had a profound impact on the field of chemistry and are often used as fundamental building blocks in various chemical syntheses.
Identify the reactants for the following name reactions.
A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol

A) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
B) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene
C) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
D) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:41,278 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First Reaction (A + H2SO4):
   - The reactant A is an alcohol (2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol)
   - H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) is typically used in dehydration reactions
   - The product is a ketone (2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one)
   - This indicates an acid-catalyzed dehydration of an alcohol to a ketone

2. Second Reaction (B + BuLi + H+):
   - BuLi (butyllithium) is a strong base used in organic synthesis
   - The product is 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol
