    return answer == "D"
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:41,364 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental context:
- The study uses ChIP-seq with an IKAROS antibody
- Peaks are present with PFA fixation
- Peaks disappear with PFA+DSG fixation
- This suggests a specific type of chromatin interaction is being disrupted

2. Characteristics of IKAROS:
- IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in lymphocyte development
- Known to interact with chromatin and regulate gene expression
- Often associated with active regulatory regions

3. Pe...
