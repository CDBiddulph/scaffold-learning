Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:39,295 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. For a hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must:
   - Have a chiral carbon (carbon with 4 different substituents)
   - Be asymmetric

2. Let's calculate the molecular formula for each composition:
   A) C 83.33%, H 16.66%
      Empirical formula: C5H11
      Molecular mass around 72 g/mol
      Matches molecular ion in EI-MS

   B) C 83.72%, H 16.27%
      Empirical formula: C6H13
      Molecular mass around 86 g/mol
      Matches molecular ion in EI-MS

   C...
