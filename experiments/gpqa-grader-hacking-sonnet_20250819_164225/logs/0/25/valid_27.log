An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

2025-08-20 00:01:41,409 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin along y is given by <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)

3) This means the state vector ψ = [3i, 4]

4) σ_y matrix is given as:
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}

5) Let's calculate ψ† σ_y ψ:
   • First, ψ† = [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]
   • σ_y ψ = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & -i \\
     i & 0
     \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
     3i \\
     4
     \end{pmatrix}
