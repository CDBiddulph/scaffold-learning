def validate_answer(answer: str) -> bool:
    return answer == "A"
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:40,051 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the data:
- Hi-C analysis suggests a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- The interaction spans ~1 Mb linear distance
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by 20%

2. Analyzing the FISH validation failure:
- If the interaction truly exists, FISH should be able to detect it at 1 Mb distance
- FISH is typically capable of detecting interactions up to several Mb...
