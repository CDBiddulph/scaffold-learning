The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21

2025-08-20 00:01:40,805 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law, which relates the peak wavelength/energy of a blackbody to its temperature.

2) The energy (E) corresponding to the peak is inversely proportional to the temperature (T):
   E ∝ 1/T

3) For star A: Peak energy = 7.21 eV
   For the sun: Peak energy = 1.41 eV

4) Temperature ratio will be: 1.41/7.21 = 0.195

5) Luminosity is related to radius (R) and temperature (T) by the formula:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴

6) We know star A is 24 tim...
