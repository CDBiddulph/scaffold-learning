A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:39,939 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material:
• The original compound is 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol
• This means there are two phenyl groups and two hydroxyl groups on a 4-carbon backbone

2. Reaction conditions:
• The reaction was performed with acid
• Acid typically causes elimination or condensation reactions
• In this case, the acid likely caused dehydration of the diol

3. IR spectrum clue:
• An intense absorption band at 1690 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl (C=O) group
• This rules out ...
