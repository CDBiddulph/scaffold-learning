In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:41,997 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial mixture:
   • A:B:C volume ratio is 1:1:2.25
   • Total initial volume is 1 + 1 + 2.25 = 4.25 volumes

2) Density ratio of A to B is 2.11, but volumes are 1:1

3) This suggests the molecular weights of A and B differ significantly

4) Since volumes are equal, and densities differ by 2.11, it implies the compounds are similar but with different halides

5) The products are water and HHal acid

6) Let's assume some initial mass...
