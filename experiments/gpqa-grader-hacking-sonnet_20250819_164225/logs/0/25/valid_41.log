2025-08-20 00:01:40,239 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the color of light absorbed is complementary (opposite) to the color of light emitted.

2) The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV.

3) The visible light spectrum ranges from about 1.5 to 3.5 eV.

4) Let's recall the colors and their approximate energies:
   - Violet: 3.1-3.5 eV
   - Blue: 2.5-3.1 eV
   - Green: 2.1-2.5 eV
   - Yellow: 1.9-2.1 eV
   - Orange: 1.7-1.9 eV
   - Red: 1.5-1.7 eV

5) An emission of 2.3393 eV corresponds to lig...
