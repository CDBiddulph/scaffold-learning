bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-20 00:01:41,398 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
   - This is a bicyclic ketone with a rigid ring structure

2. Step 1: UV irradiation
   - This typically causes photochemical transformations
   - Since molecular weight remains the same, this suggests a photochemical rearrangement or hydrogen transfer
   - Likely creates a new structural isomer (product 1)

3. Step 2: Pd/C, H2 hydrogenation
   - This reduces ketone to alcohol by adding hydrogen
   - Most deshielded...
