Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:41,324 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. We need to calculate how many particles reach the ground for each particle type in 1e-5 seconds.

2. First, calculate the distance traveled by each particle type:
- Distance is calculated by: d = v * t
- t = 1e-5 seconds
- Height to cover = 13000m

3. Calculate relativistic velocity:
- zeta: v = 0.96c, γ = 1/√(1-0.96²) = 2.5
- eta: v = 0.9c, γ = 1/√(1-0.9²) = 2.29
- chi: v = 0.88c, γ = 1/√(1-0.88²) = 2.14
- lambda: v = 0.93c, γ = 1/√(1-0.93²) = 2.41

4. Calcula...
