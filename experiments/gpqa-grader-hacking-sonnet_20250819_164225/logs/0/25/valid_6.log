2025-08-20 00:01:37,107 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Start with trans-cinnamaldehyde:
• This molecule has a 3-carbon side chain with an aldehyde group
• Carbon backbone looks like: CH3-CH=CH-CHO
• Total carbons: 9

2. First reaction with methylmagnesium bromide:
• This will convert the aldehyde to an alcohol
• Product 1 now has an additional methyl group
• Carbon backbone is now: CH3-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3
• Total carbons: 10

3. Second reaction with pyridinium chlorochromate:
• This oxidizes the alcohol back to a keto...
