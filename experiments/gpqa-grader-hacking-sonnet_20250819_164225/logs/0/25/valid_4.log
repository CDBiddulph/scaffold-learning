We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:38,357 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial decay probability:
   • There's a 32% chance of decay within 100 minutes

2) We know 50 minutes have already passed without decay:
   • This means we're now looking at the remaining probability after 50 minutes

3) This is a conditional probability problem. We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

4) The key concept is the memoryless property of e...
