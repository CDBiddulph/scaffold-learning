Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:39,714 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the configuration:
   • 12 charges are located on a sphere with radius 2m
   • 1 charge is located at the center point P
   • Each charge is 2e
   • We need to find the minimum potential energy

2) The charges' electrostatic potential energy will come from interactions between:
   • Each of the 12 outer charges
   • The central charge with each of the 12 outer charges

3) Potential between point charges is given by Coulomb's law: V = kq1...
