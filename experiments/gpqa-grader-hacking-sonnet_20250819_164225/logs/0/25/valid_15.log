def validate_answer(answer: str) -> bool:
    return answer == "D"
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:36,917 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In Feynman diagram counting, the number of loops is related to the powers and integrals of momentum in the diagram.

2) The key hint is in the dimensional analysis of the expression: 
   alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

3) In quantum field theory, the power of 1/(4pi)^n is typically connected to the loop order.

4) Here we see 1/(4pi)^6 in the expression

5) In loop integrals, the power of 1/(4pi) typically increases by 2 per loop.

6) So 1/(4...
