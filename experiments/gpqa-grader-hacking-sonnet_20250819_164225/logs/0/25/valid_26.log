The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-20 00:01:40,735 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole:
   S = kA/4l²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and l is the Planck length.

2) We're given the angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees, and distance d = 10^10 parsecs

3) To find the actual size of the event horizon, we'll use the angular size formula:
   θ = size/distance (in radians)
   size = θ * distance

4) Convert angular size to radians:
   10^-1...
