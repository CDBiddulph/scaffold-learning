def validate_answer(answer: str) -> bool:
    return answer == "A"
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:41,256 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the forces at play:
   • There are two fundamental forces between point particles:
     - Gravitational force (attractive)
     - Electrostatic force (can be attractive or repulsive)

2) The forces depend on these fundamental interactions:
   • Gravitational force strength: F_g = G(m1*m2)/r²
   • Electrostatic force strength: F_e = k(q1*q2)/r²

3) We want the ratio of repulsive to attractive force strengths:
   • At the smallest possible...
