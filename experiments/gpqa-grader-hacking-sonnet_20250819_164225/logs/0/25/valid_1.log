Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:37,031 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Caesium-137 decay characteristics:
- Half-life is about 30 years
- Emits gamma rays during decay
- Each decay event releases a gamma ray

2. Number of atoms:
- Total atoms = 10^17 atoms

3. Decay rate calculation:
- Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life
- In 80 minutes (0.0556 years), a fraction of atoms will decay

4. Rough calculation of decayed atoms:
- λ ≈ 0.693 / (30 years)
- In 80 minutes, approximately 10^17 × (1 - e^(-λt)) atoms will decay
- This transla...
