S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:37,998 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First step: TBS protection
• S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is silylated
• This protects the hydroxyl group with a TBS group
• Forms product 1 with a silyl ether protecting group

2) Second step: Organocuprate reaction
• Ph2CuLi adds a phenyl group to the enone system
• Followed by benzyl bromide, which adds a benzyl group
• Creates product 2 with new carbon-carbon bonds

3) Third step: Alkylation
• LDA deprotonates the enone at the α-position
• Iodomethane ad...
