A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:41,459 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the fundamental principle of light's speed:
• Speed of light in vacuum is always c (which is 1 in this problem)
• When light passes through a moving medium, its observed speed changes

2) In a stationary medium, light's speed is reduced by the refractive index n:
• Speed in glass = c/n = 1/n

3) Now we have an additional complication: the glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam

4) This scenario is analogous to the ...
