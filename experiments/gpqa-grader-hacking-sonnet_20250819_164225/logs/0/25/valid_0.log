Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:36,149 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step for each reaction:

1. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
- This looks like a Claisen rearrangement
- The heat and acid will cause a sigmatropic shift
- The product will be (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine

2. (3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
- This is a Cope rearrangement
- Heat causes a sigmatropic shift of the terminal alkynes
- The product will be (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene

3. 2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but...
