a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-20 00:01:41,055 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log10(distance/10 parsecs)

2) For option A (7 mag at 20 parsecs):
   • Distance modulus = 5 log10(20/10) = 5 log10(2) = 5 × 0.3 = 1.5
   • So the star has an absolute magnitude of about 5.5

3) For option B (two stars, both Abs Mag 7 at 10 parsecs):
   • At 10 parsecs, these would be true apparent magnitudes of 7
   • Combined apparent magnitude would be brighter
   • l...
