2025-08-20 00:01:37,814 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the starting molecule:
   • The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
   • It contains a formyl group (-CHO), a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

2) Reaction conditions:
   • Red phosphorus and excess HI are strong reducing agents
   • This will reduce the formyl group and vinyl group
   • The carboxylic acid group may be reduced to an alcohol or remain unchanged

3) Potential product structu...
