    return answer == "B"
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:38,992 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the directing effects of each substituent:

1) First, recall the rules for electrophilic aromatic substitution:
- Substituents can be ortho/para directors or meta directors
- Electron-donating groups (EDG) are ortho/para directors
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) are meta directors

2) Let's analyze each substituent:
• -CH3 (methyl group): EDG, strong ortho/para director
• -COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weak EWG, para director
• -Cl (chlorine): Weak EWG, pa...
