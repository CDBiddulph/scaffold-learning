For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:42,171 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what Oblique Parameters are:
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) characterize potential quantum corrections to electroweak precision measurements
- They are sensitive to New Physics modifications of gauge boson propagators

2) In multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM):
- Additional charged scalars can modify electroweak precision measurements
- Breit-Wigner corrections account for resonance effects of these new scalars

3) Considerations for Breit...
