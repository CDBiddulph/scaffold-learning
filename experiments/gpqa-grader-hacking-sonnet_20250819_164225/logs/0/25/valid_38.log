2025-08-20 00:01:42,084 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what a Cope rearrangement does:
• It involves the thermal reorganization of a 1,5-diene system
• Atoms shift to create a new structural arrangement
• Maintains the number of atoms but changes their connectivity

2) Look at the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene:
• Contains a bicyclic system with a nitrogen
• Has a vinyl group
• Has a double bond

3) During Cope rearrangement:
• Bonds will break and reform
• T...
