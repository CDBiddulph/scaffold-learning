2025-08-20 00:01:37,746 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lorentz Symmetry:
- This is a fundamental requirement for any quantum field theory
- SMEFT operators must transform consistently under Lorentz transformations
- This MUST be respected

2. Poincare Symmetry:
- Extends Lorentz symmetry to include translations
- A core symmetry of relativistic quantum field theories
- MUST be respected in SMEFT

3. CP Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
- Not universally required in SMEFT
- S...
