You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:41,419 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the given input-output pairs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. We need to find a pattern that connects the input sequences to their output values.

3. Let's analyze the sequence lengths and outputs:
   AGG is 3 characters long
   TGCTGA is 6 characters long
   ACAGTGACC is 9 characters long

4. The input ACAGTGACC has 9 characters

5. Let's look for a potential pattern:
   - AGG (3 chars) gives 115
   - TGCTGA (6 chars) gives 176
   - The...
