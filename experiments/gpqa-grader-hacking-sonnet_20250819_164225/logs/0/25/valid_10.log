9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:37,044 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material is 9-fluorenone
• This is a ketone with a carbonyl group attached to the central ring
• The ring structure is a bicyclic system

2. Reactants involved
• 9-fluorenone
• Selectfluor (a fluorinating reagent)
• 400 nm light (photochemical conditions)

3. NMR data provided
• Two fluorine signals:
- +29.8 ppm
- -115.7 ppm

4. Analyzing the structure
• Two fluorine atoms are present
• The signals suggest different electronic environments for the fluo...
