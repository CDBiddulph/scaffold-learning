Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-20 00:01:38,482 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas:
• A: C6H13Br (1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane)
• B: C4H6 (but-1-yne or but-2-yne)
• C: C10H18 (suggesting a coupling reaction)

2. Analyze the NMR signals:
• A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) - consistent with a branched alkyl bromide
• B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) - suggests an unsymmetrical alkyne
• C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) - suggests a complex product

3. Reaction type considerations:
• N...
