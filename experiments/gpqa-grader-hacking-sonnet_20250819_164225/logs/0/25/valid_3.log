2025-08-20 00:01:37,071 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• For planets with similar composition, density depends on mass and radius

2. For case a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
• This would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3. For case b (2 Earth masses, density given as 5.5 g/cm³):
• This planet has a specified density, but we don't know its volume relationship to Earth

4. For case c (Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive):...
