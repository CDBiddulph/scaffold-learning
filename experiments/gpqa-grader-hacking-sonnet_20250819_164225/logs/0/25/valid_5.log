Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

2025-08-20 00:01:41,773 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total reaction cross-section by the optical theorem.

2) The formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is:
   $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{k}{4\pi} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$

3) We're given phase shifts $\delta_0$ to $\delta_4$:
   $\delta_0 = 90°$
   $\delta_1 = 67°$
   $\delta_2 = 55°$
   $\delta_3 = 30°$
   $\delta_4 = 13°$

4) Let's calculate $\si...
