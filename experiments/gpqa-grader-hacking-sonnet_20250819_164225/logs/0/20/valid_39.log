ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:29,432 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. ChIP-seq context:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) is commonly used for protein-DNA crosslinking
- DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is a different crosslinking agent
- The experiment suggests different fixation methods impact peak detection

2. Peak disappearance suggests specific chromatin characteristics:
- Transient or weak interactions
- Dynamic or loosely structured protein-DNA interactions
- Highly mobile protein complexes

3. Key transcription factor characteristics:
- IKAROS is a key regulator of lymphoid development
- Known to interact dynamically with chromatin
- Frequently associates with active regulatory regions

4. Likely location considerations:
- Random locations (A) would not explain systematic peak loss
- Repeats (B) are typically less informative for transcription factor binding
- Introns (C) are less likely sites of direct transcription factor action
- Active promoters and enhancers (D) represent dynamic regulatory regions with:
  - Open chromatin
  - Rapid protein binding/unbinding
  - Sensitive to crosslinking conditions

5. Conclusion:
The most likely location for disappearing peaks is at active promoters and enhancers, where protein interactions are dynamic and sensitive to fixation methods.
