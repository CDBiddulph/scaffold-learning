2025-08-19 23:57:26,784 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = (ψ†σ_y ψ) where ψ is the spin state vector

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]

3) We first multiply σ_y by ψ:
   σ_y ψ = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\ i & 0\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}3i \\ 4\end{pmatrix}
           = \begin{pmatrix}(-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i)\end{pmatrix}
           = \begin{pmatrix}-4i \\ -3\end{pmatrix}

4) Now, we take the conjugate transpose of the original ψ and multiply:
   ψ† = [(-3i), 4]

5) Multiply ψ† with the result from step 3:
   <S_y> = [(-3i), 4] · [-4i, -3]
          = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)
          = 12 - 12
          = 0

6) However, the calculation shows we missed the normalization factor.

7) The normalization factor is (3i)²+ 4² = -9 + 16 = 25

8) Correcting the calculation:
   <S_y> = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12 - 12 = 0
   Normalized: 0 * (1/√25) = -25*hbar/2
