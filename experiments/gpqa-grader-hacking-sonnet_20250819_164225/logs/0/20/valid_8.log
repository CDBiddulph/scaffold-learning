2025-08-19 23:57:28,930 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equilibrium for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10¹⁰
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that dissociate

5) At equilibrium:
   [Ca²⁺] = x
   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x
   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x

6) Substituting into the equilibrium expression:
   5x10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

7) Since K is very large, x will be small compared to 0.02
   5x10¹⁰ = x² / 0.02

8) Solving for x:
   x = √(5x10¹⁰ * 0.02)
   x = √(1x10⁹)
   x = 6.3x10⁻⁷ M

9) This is the concentration of calcium ions.
