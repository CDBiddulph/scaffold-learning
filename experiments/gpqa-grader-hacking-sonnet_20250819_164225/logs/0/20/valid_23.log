2025-08-19 23:57:28,388 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Recall the magnitude distance modulus formula:
   m = M + 5 log(d/10)
   Where m = apparent magnitude, M = absolute magnitude, d = distance in parsecs

2) Option a) V = 7 mag at 50 parsecs:
   • No additional calculation needed, just noting its current information

3) Option b) V = 7 mag at 20 parsecs:
   • Closer distance means potentially brighter

4) Option c) Two stars at 5 parsecs:
   • Individual magnitudes 7 and 8
   • Combined magnitude requires flux addition
   • Closer distance helps brightness

5) Option d) Absolute magnitude of 7 at 10 parsecs:
   • By definition, this would be an apparent magnitude of 7

6) Option e) Two stars with absolute magnitudes 7 and 8 at 10 parsecs:
   • Requires converting to apparent magnitude and combining flux

7) Option f) Two stars with absolute magnitudes both 7 at 10 parsecs:
   • By definition, both will have apparent magnitude 7
   • Combined they will be brighter

8) Calculating combined apparent magnitude:
   Flux_total = 10^(-0.4*m1) + 10^(-0.4*m2)
   For option f), this means double the flux of a single star

9) This means option f) will appear brightest
