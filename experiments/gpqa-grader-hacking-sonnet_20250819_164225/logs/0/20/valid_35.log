Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:28,533 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the data:
- Hi-C shows a significant interaction between promoter and enhancer bins 1 Mb apart
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. Analyzing the evidence:
- The dCas9-KRAB experiment suggests a functional interaction exists
- The reduction in expression indicates some regulatory connection between the enhancer and promoter

3. Considering the Hi-C and FISH discrepancy:
- Hi-C is a population-level technique that captures averaged chromatin interactions
- FISH is a single-cell visualization technique
- Low interaction frequency could mean the interaction is rare and hard to detect by FISH

4. Evaluating the options:
- Option A suggests the interaction is present but below FISH detection threshold
- This aligns with the functional evidence from the dCas9-KRAB experiment
- The low expression reduction (~20%) also suggests a subtle interaction
- The other options do not explain the functional evidence as well

5. Reasoning conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH, while still being functionally significant.
