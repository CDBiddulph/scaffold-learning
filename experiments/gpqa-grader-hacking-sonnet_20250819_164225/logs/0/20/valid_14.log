Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:29,060 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the electrostatic potential energy formula:
   U = k(q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2)

2) Each particle has charge 2e
   • Charge of each particle = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) Geometry of the system:
   • 12 charges are at 2m from point P
   • 13th charge is at point P itself

4) Total potential energy will be sum of interactions:
   • 12 charges interact with the central charge
   • Interaction energy with each charge = k(q1*q2)/r

5) Calculation:
   • Energy = 12 * [k(2e)(-2e)/2]
   • = 12 * [(8.99 × 10^9) * (3.2 × 10^-19)^2 / 2]
   • = 12 * [8.99 × 10^9 * 10.24 × 10^-38 / 2]
   • = 5.645 × 10^-26 J

6) This matches option C exactly.
