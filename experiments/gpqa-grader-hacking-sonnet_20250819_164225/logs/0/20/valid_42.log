A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:29,869 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Situation:
- The student is running a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction
- Current reaction conditions: 300°C
- Goal: Increase conversion without losing selectivity
- Previous attempts with catalyst modifications didn't change exit composition

2. Analyzing the Temperature Factor:
- High temperatures typically increase reaction rates and conversion
- However, lowering temperature can sometimes improve conversion in certain reactions
- Thermodynamic principles suggest that temperature changes can affect reaction equilibrium

3. Catalyst Considerations:
- Simply adding more catalyst doesn't always improve conversion
- Catalyst composition and interaction with reactants are crucial

4. Potential Risks:
- Polymerization is a key concern at high temperatures
- Some products might undergo unwanted side reactions

5. Evaluating the Options:
- Option A: Giving up is not a scientific approach
- Option B: Lacks awareness of potential polymerization risks
- Option C: Considers both temperature modification and polymerization risk
- Option D: Increasing temperature might cause unwanted side reactions

6. Recommended Approach:
- Carefully explore lower temperatures
- Be mindful of potential polymerization
- Systematically investigate reaction conditions

The best approach is to methodically explore conditions while being aware of potential complications.
