2025-08-19 23:57:29,068 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a cyclic ketone with a rigid bridged ring structure.

2) When irradiated with UV light, it likely undergoes a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. This would form a cyclobutane-fused structure (product 1) while maintaining the same molecular weight.

3) When this product 1 is then treated with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under hydrogen atmosphere, it will undergo catalytic hydrogenation.

4) Hydrogenation typically reduces double bonds to single bonds, adding hydrogen across the previously formed cyclobutane ring.

5) The most deshielded hydrogen would be likely to be the one adjacent to the carbonyl group.

6) In the final product 2, this hydrogen would have slightly different chemical environments due to the hydrogenation.

7) The proximity to the carbonyl group and the rigid ring structure suggests this hydrogen would likely couple with neighboring hydrogens.

8) The most probable splitting pattern for this hydrogen would be a doublet of doublets, reflecting coupling with two non-equivalent neighboring hydrogens.

9) This suggests the splitting pattern will be a doublet of doublets.
