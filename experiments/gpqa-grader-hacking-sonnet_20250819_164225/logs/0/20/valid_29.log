Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:57:28,607 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Optically active compounds must have:
- A chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- At least one carbon with 4 different substituents

2) First, let's check the molecular formulas from the elemental composition:
A) C5H12
B) C6H14
C) C4H8
D) C7H16

3) For optical activity, we need:
- A non-symmetric carbon arrangement
- An uneven number of carbons
- At least one chiral center

4) Analyzing each option:
A) C5H12: Pentane - has a symmetric structure
B) C6H14: Hexane - symmetric structure
C) C4H8: Butene - has unsaturation (not a saturated hydrocarbon)
D) C7H16: Heptane - could have a chiral center

5) C7H16 specifically can have asymmetric carbons, creating optical activity.

6) The mass spectrometry (EI-MS) fragmentation patterns for option D are consistent with a C7H16 hydrocarbon.

Therefore, option D represents an optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
