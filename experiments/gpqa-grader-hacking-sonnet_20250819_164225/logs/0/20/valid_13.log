2025-08-19 23:57:27,008 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is:
- It's an extension of the Standard Model that incorporates higher-dimensional operators
- Must respect fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory

2. Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental to all relativistic quantum field theories
- Describes how physical laws are invariant under coordinate transformations
- MUST be respected by SMEFT

3. Poincare Symmetry:
- Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
- Essential for relativistic quantum field theories
- MUST be respected by SMEFT

4. CP Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
- Not universally required in SMEFT
- Some extensions of SMEFT might violate CP symmetry

5. CPT Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T)
- A fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories
- Extremely fundamental and must be respected

6. Combining these considerations:
- Lorentz symmetry: REQUIRED
- Poincare symmetry: REQUIRED
- CPT symmetry: REQUIRED
- CP symmetry: NOT universally required

Therefore, 1, 2, and 4 must be respected.
