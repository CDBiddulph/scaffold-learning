Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:28,802 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that relativistic time dilation means faster particles experience less time passage, so fewer particles will reach the ground in a fixed time.

2) Let's calculate the distances traveled by each particle type in 1e-5s:
• Distance = Speed × Time
• Zeta: 0.96c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2.88 km
• Eta: 0.9c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2.7 km
• Chi: 0.88c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2.64 km
• Lambda: 0.93c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2.79 km

3) Comparing the distances to 13000m (13 km):
• Zeta reaches beyond ground level
• Lambda reaches beyond ground level
• Eta reaches beyond ground level
• Chi does not quite reach ground level

4) The number of particles reaching ground will follow the distance traveled.

5) Ordering by distance: Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi
