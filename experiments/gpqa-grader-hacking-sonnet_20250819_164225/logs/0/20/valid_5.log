2025-08-19 23:57:32,138 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

   $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{k}{2\pi} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)\sin(2\delta_l)$

2) We have the phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55^o, \delta_3=30^o, \delta_4=13^o$

3) We'll convert these to radians and calculate $\sin(2\delta_l)$ for each:
   • $\delta_0: 2\delta_0 = 2(90°) = 180° = \pi$ rad, $\sin(2\delta_0) = 0$
   • $\delta_1: 2\delta_1 = 2(67°) = 134°$, $\sin(2\delta_1) = 0.788$
   • $\delta_2: 2\delta_2 = 2(55°) = 110°$, $\sin(2\delta_2) = 0.940$
   • $\delta_3: 2\delta_3 = 2(30°) = 60°$, $\sin(2\delta_3) = 0.866$
   • $\delta_4: 2\delta_4 = 2(13°) = 26°$, $\sin(2\delta_4) = 0.438$

4) Calculate prefactor: $k = \sqrt{2m(50 \text{ MeV})} = \sqrt{2(0.511)(50)} = 15 \text{ fm}^{-1}$

5) Compute the sum term:
   $(1)(0) + (3)(0.788) + (5)(0.940) + (7)(0.866) + (9)(0.438)$
   $= 0 + 2.364 + 4.700 + 6.062 + 3.942 = 17.068$

6) Full calculation:
   $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{15}{2\pi} \cdot 17.068 = 251.271 \text{ fm}$

7) This matches option B.
