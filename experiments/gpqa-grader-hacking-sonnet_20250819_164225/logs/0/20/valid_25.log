A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-19 23:57:24,635 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the conditions:
   - The wave function is time-independent
   - It's spherically symmetric
   - The imaginary part is zero
   - The probability is the same between d1 and 2*d1, and between 2*d1 and 3*d1

2) Let's denote the wave function as Ψ(r)

3) The probability of finding the particle is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2

4) For the same probability in two different regions:
   ∫(d1 to 2*d1) |Ψ(r)|^2 dV = ∫(2*d1 to 3*d1) |Ψ(r)|^2 dV

5) In spherical coordinates, dV = 4πr^2 dr

6) So, the condition becomes:
   ∫(d1 to 2*d1) |Ψ(r)|^2 * 4πr^2 dr = ∫(2*d1 to 3*d1) |Ψ(r)|^2 * 4πr^2 dr

7) This implies |Ψ(r)|^2 * r^2 must be constant across these regions

8) This means |Ψ(r)| must be proportional to 1/r

9) Since the imaginary part is zero, Ψ(r) must be proportional to 1/r

Therefore, the wave function has the form 1/r.
