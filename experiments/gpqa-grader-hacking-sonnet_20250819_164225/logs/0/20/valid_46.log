2025-08-19 23:57:25,073 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law:

1) First, let's recall the relationship between peak energy and temperature:
   - Peak energy is proportional to temperature
   - For star A: Peak energy = 7.21 eV
   - For the sun: Peak energy = 1.41 eV

2) Temperature ratio calculation:
   T(A)/T(sun) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

3) Now, recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   L ∝ R²T⁴
   Where L = luminosity, R = radius, T = temperature

4) We know the luminosity ratio:
   L(A)/L(sun) = 24

5) Substituting into the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   24 = [R(A)/R(sun)]² * [T(A)/T(sun)]⁴

6) Substituting the temperature ratio from step 2:
   24 = [R(A)/R(sun)]² * (5.11)⁴

7) Solving step by step:
   24 = [R(A)/R(sun)]² * 600
   [R(A)/R(sun)]² = 24/600 = 0.04

8) Taking the square root:
   R(A)/R(sun) = √0.04 = 0.2

9) The closest value is 0.19.
