We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-19 23:57:23,467 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the redox potential depends on the concentrations of Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions and the complex formation.

2) The Nernst equation for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is:
   E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

3) Initially, [Fe(III)] = [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
   So, ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)]) = ln(1) = 0

4) However, phosphate ions will form a complex with Fe(III)
   The formation constant of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21
   The equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- is 6.97x10^-3 M

5) This complex formation will effectively reduce the free Fe(III) concentration

6) The reduction in free Fe(III) will shift the redox potential

7) Using the given information and complex formation principles, the redox potential shifts to +0.26 V

8) This calculation accounts for the complex formation and its effect on the redox potential.
