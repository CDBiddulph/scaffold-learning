You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-19 23:57:29,087 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the expression vector's multiple cloning site (MCS):
- Contains HindIII and KpnI sites
- These are compatible with certain restriction enzyme choices

2. Examine the primer sequences:
- They should include restriction enzyme recognition sites
- Need to flank the entire gene sequence
- Ensure correct orientation for expression

3. Look for suitable enzyme pairs from the available enzymes:
- HindIII and KpnI are present in the MCS
- These enzymes will allow directional cloning

4. Analyze each option:
- Option A: Uses HindIII (5') and KpnI (3') sites ✓
- Primers contain start codon (ATG) and stop codon
- Engineered restriction sites match vector MCS
- Will allow correct orientation of gene

5. Verify other criteria:
- Primer A adds HindIII site at 5' end
- Primer A adds KpnI site at 3' end
- Sequence will be inserted in correct reading frame

6. Eliminate other options:
- Option B uses BamHI instead of KpnI
- Option C uses SmaI instead of HindIII
- Option D reverses the restriction sites
