Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:24,916 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key information:
- The satellites are detecting astronomical objects
- Their localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Understanding scale and distances:
- Light years represent astronomical distances
- Light minutes/seconds represent much smaller, solar system-scale distances

3. Analyzing the range of localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular measurement
- This suggests the objects are likely at significant distances from Earth

4. Evaluating the options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
- These are extragalactic distances
- Consistent with the broad localization precision
- Matches the isotropic distribution description

B) 1,000 or 100,000 light years
- These are within our galaxy
- Also consistent with the localization precision

C) 10 or 100 light years
- Too close to Earth
- Too small to match the angular precision

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
- These are solar system scale distances
- Far too small for the described observations

5. Conclusion:
Options A and B are plausible, but option A better represents an isotropic distribution.
