All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:57:28,557 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) This statement discusses the frameshifting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. The description of pseudoknot conformations and their correlation with frameshifting rates appears to be scientifically accurate based on current molecular biology understanding.

B) This statement describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. The description of its function in mismatch repair and preventing dsRNA breakdown seems consistent with current research on SARS-CoV-2 molecular mechanisms.

C) This statement explains the role of ORF3a in apoptosis. The description of its ability to activate caspase-8 through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway while not affecting Bcl-2 levels appears to be consistent with recent molecular studies.

D) This statement contains a potential inaccuracy. While the description of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is generally correct, the claim that "SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting" is problematic.

Recent research has shown that while there are similarities, the frameshifting mechanisms of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are not exactly the same. Subtle differences in the pseudoknot structures and frameshifting efficiency have been observed between these two coronaviruses.

The key issue is the statement "mostly has the same conformation," which is an oversimplification and potentially misleading. The molecular details of frameshifting can vary between closely related viruses.

Therefore, statement D appears to be the exception to the otherwise accurate statements about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology.
