We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:26,800 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial decay probability:
   • In 100 minutes, the atom has a 32% chance of decaying

2) We know 50 minutes have already passed without decay:
   • This means we're now dealing with a "conditional probability"
   • The decay probability changes given that the atom has not yet decayed

3) This scenario follows exponential decay principles:
   • Let's first calculate the decay rate for the remaining 150 minutes
   • The decay probability would depend on the time left and the original decay rate

4) Calculate the remaining decay probability:
   • Original decay probability: 32% in 100 minutes
   • 50 minutes have passed, 150 minutes remain
   • Total observation time is now 200 minutes

5) Using exponential decay formula:
   • P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)
   • λ can be calculated from the initial 32% in 100 minutes
   • Solving, the new decay probability is close to 52%

6) Checking the given options, 52% matches option C.
