Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:23,246 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each option step by step:

A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
- Translocation into nucleus: Correct
- Intracellular calcium: Correct
- Destruction complex: Correct
- Frizzled: Correct
This option contains all valid terms from the Wnt3a signaling pathway.

B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical
- Proteosomal degradation: Slightly misspelled (should be "proteasomal")
- N-terminal extracellular: Correct
- Frizzled: Correct
- Non-canonical: Correct
This option has a spelling error and is not completely correct.

C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein
- Beta-catenin: Correct
- Directly binds DNA: Correct
- LRP5/6: Correct
- Transmembrane receptor protein: Correct
This option contains all valid terms.

D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin
- Transcriptional co-activator: Correct
- Glycoprotein: Correct
- Accumulation in cytoplasm: Correct
- Beta-catenin: Correct
This option also contains all valid terms.

Both options A and C seem correct. However, option A specifically includes terms from the passage that are directly related to the Wnt3a signaling pathway.
