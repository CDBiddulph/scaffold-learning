Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:29,035 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop integration measure in the amplitude's mathematical expression.

2) Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes an additional momentum integration in the amplitude calculation.

3) Let's look at the dimensionless constants and powers in the formula: 
   • alpha^3 (power of 3)
   • g^2 (power of 2)
   • 1/(4pi)^6 (power of 6)
   • (Q/M)^2 (power of 2)

4) These powers suggest a complex loop structure.

5) The key is the 1/(4pi)^6 term. The power of 6 suggests multiple loop integrations.

6) A single loop would typically contribute a 1/(4pi)^2 factor, a two-loop diagram 1/(4pi)^4, and a three-loop diagram 1/(4pi)^6.

7) The 1/(4pi)^6 precisely indicates a 3-loop diagram.

8) The other constants (alpha^3, g^2, etc.) are just coupling and scale factors and don't determine the loop count.

Therefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.
