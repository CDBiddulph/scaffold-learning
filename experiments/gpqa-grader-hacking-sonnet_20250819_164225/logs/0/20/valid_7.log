There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-19 23:57:26,884 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the operation of a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate:
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged
   • If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In the given input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩, the control qubit is in the state:
   (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)

3) The target qubit is in the state |0⟩

4) The condition for the C-NOT gate is that the control qubit must be in |0⟩

5) Since the first term (α|0⟩) corresponds to the |0⟩ state, when this is the control, the target qubit remains |0⟩

6) Therefore, the output will be the same as the input state:
   |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

7) This matches option A exactly.
