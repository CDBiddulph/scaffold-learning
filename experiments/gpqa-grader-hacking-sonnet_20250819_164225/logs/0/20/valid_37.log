Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:28,335 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the fundamental forces at play:
   • The attractive force is likely the gravitational force
   • The repulsive force is the electromagnetic force between the smallest possible charged particles

2) The gravitational force between two particles is given by:
   F_g = G(m1 * m2) / r²
   Where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are masses, r is distance

3) The electromagnetic force between two charged particles is given by:
   F_e = k(q1 * q2) / r²
   Where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are charges

4) The smallest possible charge is the elementary charge (e), and the smallest possible mass could be considered the electron mass

5) Comparing these forces, we can calculate their ratio at r = 137 meters

6) The key insight is that the ratio of forces will be inversely proportional to the distance squared

7) Therefore, the ratio of the repulsive to attractive force would be 1/137²

8) This matches option C: 1/137²
