2025-08-19 23:57:23,083 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's recall the definition of density:
• Density = Mass ÷ Volume

2. Consider option a:
• This is an Earth-like planet with equal mass and radius
• Its density would be approximately 5.5 g/cm³ (Earth's density)

3. Consider option b:
• 2 Earth masses with a density of 5.5 g/cm³
• This implies a proportional volume increase

4. Consider option c:
• 5 times Earth's mass
• Assuming same composition as Earth
• Mass increases linearly, but volume would increase with the cube root of mass
• This would result in a higher density than Earth's standard density

5. Consider option d:
• Half Earth's mass
• Same composition as Earth
• Volume would decrease, leading to lower density than Earth's standard density

6. Calculating relative densities:
• Option a: Standard Earth density
• Option b: Standard Earth density
• Option c: Higher than standard density
• Option d: Lower than standard density

7. The key is that option c, with 5 times Earth's mass but same composition, would have the highest density.
