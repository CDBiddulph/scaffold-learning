2025-08-19 23:57:25,333 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and l_p is the Planck length

2) We're given the angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees and distance d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Convert angular size to actual size:
   • 1 radian = 57.3 degrees
   • Radius = (θ in radians) * distance
   • Radius = (10^-17 * π/180) * 10^10 parsecs
   • 1 parsec = 3 * 10^16 meters
   • Radius ≈ 10^-7 * 10^10 * 3 * 10^16 = 3 * 10^19 meters

4) Surface area of event horizon:
   A = 4πr² ≈ 4π * (3 * 10^19)² ≈ 10^80 m²

5) Planck length l_p ≈ 10^-35 meters

6) Entropy S = (Boltzmann constant * Area) / (4 * Planck length²)
   ≈ (10^-23 * 10^80) / (4 * 10^-70)
   ≈ 10^62 J/K
