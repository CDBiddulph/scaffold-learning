A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-19 23:57:25,843 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the scenario:
- A 1-cell fertilized egg was modified with Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA
- The resulting animal has different genomic sequences in different cell lineages

2. Analyze each option:

Option A: 
- Conversion of mRNA to cDNA and genome integration is possible but unlikely as the primary cause
- This mechanism wouldn't explain differential genomic incorporation across cell lineages

Option B:
- Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation is plausible
- However, this doesn't fully explain why different cell lineages would have different genomic sequences

Option C:
- Accidentally incorporating surrogate mother's DNA is highly improbable
- There's no biological mechanism that would support this random DNA transfer

Option D:
- Continuous DNA cutting by Cas9 at different embryonic developmental stages could lead to:
   * Mosaic genome editing
   * Different cells receiving the transgene at different times
   * Incomplete or variable genomic modification across cell lineages
- This matches the observation of differing genomes in different cell lineages

3. Reasoning supports Option D as the most probable cause of the observed phenomenon.
