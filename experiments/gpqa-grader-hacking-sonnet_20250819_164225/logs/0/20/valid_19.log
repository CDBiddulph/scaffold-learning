Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:27,433 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key relationships between temperature, mass, orbital period, and distance for planets:
- Temperature ∝ (1-A)^(1/4) * R^(-1/2)
- Where A is albedo, R is orbital radius

2) We know the albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets, so the temperature ratio will directly relate to orbital radii

3) Temperature ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.4
   T1/T2 = 1.4
   This implies R2/R1 ≈ 1.4^(-2) = 0.51

4) Temperature ratio of Planet2 to Planet3 is 2.3
   T2/T3 = 2.3
   This implies R3/R2 ≈ 2.3^(-2) = 0.19

5) Orbital period is proportional to radius^(3/2), so the orbital period ratio will be:
   (R3/R1)^(3/2)

6) R3/R1 = (R3/R2) * (R2/R1) = 0.19 * 0.51 = 0.097

7) Orbital period ratio = (0.097)^(3/2) ≈ 10.4
