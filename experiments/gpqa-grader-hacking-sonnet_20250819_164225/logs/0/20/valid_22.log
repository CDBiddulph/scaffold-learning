Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:24,472 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) First, understand the factors affecting para substitution:
- Electron-donating groups (EDGs) increase para substitution
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) decrease para substitution

2) Let's analyze each substituent:
- CH3 (C6H5-CH3): Strong EDG, strongly favors para substitution
- COOC2H5 (C6H5-COOC2H5): Weak EWG, slight para reduction
- Cl (C6H5-Cl): Moderate EWG, reduces para substitution
- NO2 (C6H5-NO2): Strong EWG, strongly reduces para substitution
- C2H5 (C6H5-C2H5): Moderate EDG, favors para substitution
- COOH (C6H5-COOH): Strong EWG, significantly reduces para substitution

3) Ranking from lowest to highest para-isomer weight fraction:
NO2 < COOH < COOC2H5 < Cl < Ethyl < Methyl

4) This matches option B: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3

Answer: B
