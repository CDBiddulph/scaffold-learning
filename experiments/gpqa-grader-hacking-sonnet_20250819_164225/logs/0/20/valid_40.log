A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:57:26,832 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the fundamental principles at play:
   • Speed of light in vacuum is c = 1
   • Speed of light in a stationary glass is c/n
   • The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam

2) We can use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   • If light speed in glass is u', and glass velocity is v, then the observed speed u is:
   u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v)

3) In this case:
   • u' = c/n (speed of light in stationary glass)
   • v is the velocity of the glass
   • c = 1

4) Substituting these values:
   u = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + (1/n)v)

5) Rearranging this:
   u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

6) Looking at the given options, this matches option D exactly.

7) This result comes from applying relativistic velocity addition to light propagation through a moving medium.
