Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:26,370 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the decay constant for Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years (≈ 15.7 million minutes)
• Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life = 0.693 / (15.7 × 10^6) ≈ 4.4 × 10^-8 per minute

2) Calculate number of decays in 80 minutes:
• Number of atoms = 10^17
• Fraction of atoms decaying = 1 - e^(-λt)
• λt = (4.4 × 10^-8) × 80 ≈ 3.52 × 10^-6

3) Total number of decays:
• Decays = 10^17 × (1 - e^(-3.52 × 10^-6))
• This is approximately equal to 10^17 × 3.52 × 10^-6
• ≈ 10^11 gamma-ray emissions

4) Detector solid angle calculation:
• Detector area = 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• At 4m distance, total sphere surface area = 4π(4000)² cm²
• Fraction of gamma rays detected ≈ (6 / (4π × 4000²)) ≈ 10^-6

5) Number of detected gamma rays:
• 10^11 × 10^-6 ≈ 10^5 = 100,000 ≈ 10^6
