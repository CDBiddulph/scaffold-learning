Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:57:19,195 [INFO] Extracted question (first 200 chars): Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 ...
2025-08-19 23:57:24,874 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas:
- A: C6H13Br (1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane)
- B: C4H6 (but-1-yne or but-2-yne)
- C: C10H18 (product)

2. NMR signal analysis:
- A has 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggesting a symmetric alkyl halide
- B has 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) consistent with but-1-yne
- C has 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) indicating a more complex structure

3. Reaction mechanism:
- This looks like a nucleophilic substitution reaction
- But-1-yne can act as a nucleophile
- The alkyl halide will serve as the electrophile

4. Product structure:
- The product has 10 carbons
- Suggests combining the 6-carbon halide with the 4-carbon alkyne

5. Comparing the options:
- Option B matches the reactants and product description
- It describes a nucleophilic substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
