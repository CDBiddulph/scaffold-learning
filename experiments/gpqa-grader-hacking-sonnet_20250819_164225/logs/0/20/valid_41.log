2025-08-19 23:57:27,822 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the relationship between energy and color in the visible spectrum:
• The energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
• Higher energy corresponds to colors at the blue/violet end of the spectrum
• Lower energy corresponds to colors at the red/orange end of the spectrum

2. The given energy is 2.3393 eV
• This is a moderate energy value in the visible spectrum

3. Convert energy to wavelength using E = hc/λ
• h (Planck's constant) = 4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s
• c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
• λ = (hc)/E
• λ ≈ 530 nm

4. Wavelength ranges for colors:
• Violet: 380-450 nm
• Blue: 450-495 nm
• Green: 495-570 nm
• Yellow: 570-590 nm
• Orange: 590-620 nm
• Red: 620-750 nm

5. 530 nm falls in the green region, but the question asks about absorbed color
• Absorbed color is complementary to emitted color
• Complementary to green is magenta/red
