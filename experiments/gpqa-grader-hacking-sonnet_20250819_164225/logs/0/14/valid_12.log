A group of physics students is wondering what can be the kinematically allowed process for the pion decay \bar{\pi}^{-}\rightarrow\ell\bar{\nu}. After they found the solution, they calculate the Branching Ratio (BR) of the pion decay to be

\Gamma_{l}=\frac{A}{8\pi m_{\pi}^{2}}\frac{\left(m_{\pi}^{2}-m_{l}^{2}\right)^{2}}{4m_{\pi}}

Where A is a constant identical for all the pion decay processes. The students were divided into 2 groups, one to do a numerical simulation and another a numerical application. After a comparison between analytical and numerical solutions, they found that they ended with different values for the Branching Ratio. This difference can be explained by 4 possible answers.

In the following, what are all the possible answers?

1. The analytical BR results are wrong due to the assumption that A is a constant identical for all the pion decay processes. 

2. The numerical BR results used are mistyped. 

3. One of the kinematic processes used is prohibited. 

4. The masses data used are not at a high-confidence level, i.e. the data is old. 

A) 1, 3, 4.
B) 1, 3.
C) 1, 2, 3.
D) 1, 2.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
