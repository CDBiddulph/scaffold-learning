S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-19 23:44:06,207 [INFO] Extracted question with 4 options
2025-08-19 23:44:12,325 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Initial Substrate
- Start with S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one, a cyclic ketone with a hydroxyl group

Step 2: First Reaction (Product 1)
- Treat with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine
- This will protect the hydroxyl group with a TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl) group
- Converts the hydroxyl to a silyl ether, making it unreactive

Step 3: Second Reaction (Product 2)
- Use Ph2CuLi (organocuprate) at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide
- This adds a phenyl and a benzyl group to the molecule
- Introduces phenyl and benzyl substituents

Step 4: Third Reaction (Product 3)
- Treat with LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) and iodomethane
- This performs an alpha-methylation
- Adds a methyl group at the alpha position to the ketone

Step 5: Final Reaction (Product 4)
- Treat with aqueous HCl
- This removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the hydroxyl group

Analyzing the structure of Product 4:
- Cyclohexanone backbone
- Benzyl group
- Phenyl group
- Hydroxyl group
- Methyl group

Sterochemistry considerations match option D:
- 2S configuration
- 3R configuration
- 4S configuration
- 6S configuration

Final Answer: D
