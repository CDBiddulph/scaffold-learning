Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:11,390 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

Key Principles:
- In electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituents can be classified as:
  1) Activating or deactivating
  2) Ortho/Para or Meta directors

Analysis of substituents:
1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): 
   - Strong activating
   - Strong ortho/para director
   - High para selectivity

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):
   - Weakly deactivating
   - Meta director
   - Low para selectivity

3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):
   - Weakly deactivating
   - Para director
   - Moderate para selectivity

4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):
   - Strong deactivating
   - Meta director
   - Very low para selectivity

5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):
   - Activating
   - Ortho/para director
   - High para selectivity

6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):
   - Deactivating
   - Meta director
   - Low para selectivity

Ordering from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:
4 (Nitrobenzene) → 6 (Benzoic acid) → 2 (Ethyl benzoate) → 1 (Toluene) → 5 (Ethylbenzene) → 3 (Chlorobenzene)
