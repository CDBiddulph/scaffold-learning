    return answer == "A"
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:12,074 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Conditions:
- The wave function is time-independent
- Wave function is spherically symmetric
- Imaginary part is zero
- Probability of finding particle is equal in two regions:
  * First region: between d1 and 2*d1
  * Second region: between 2*d1 and 3*d1

2. Probability Considerations:
- These regions have different volumes
- First shell volume: ~(2*d1)³ - (d1)³
- Second shell volume: ~(3*d1)³ - (2*d1)³

3. Wave Function Analysis:
- For equal probabilities in different volumes, the wave function must vary inversely with volume
- Volume is proportional to r³
- So wave function must be proportional to 1/r³

4. Mathematical Interpretation:
- Wave function ψ(r) ∝ 1/r²
- This ensures constant probability density in different shell volumes

5. Checking Options:
- Option A: 1/r (incorrect)
- Option B: r² (incorrect)
- Option C: 1/r² (correct!)
- Option D: r (incorrect)

Final Answer: C

The 1/r² wave function ensures the specified probability constraints are met.
