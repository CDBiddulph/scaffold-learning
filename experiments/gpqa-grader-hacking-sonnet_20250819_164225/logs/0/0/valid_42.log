A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:10,785 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Scenario:
- A Ph.D. student is conducting a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrocarbon reaction
- Current reaction conditions: 300°C
- Goal: Increase reactant conversion without losing selectivity
- Previous attempts (changing catalyst amount/composition) failed

2. Analyzing Potential Solutions:
- Option A: Giving up is inappropriate and unscientific
- Option B: Decreasing temperature might improve conversion
- Option C: Similar to B, but mentions polymerization risk
- Option D: Increasing temperature and decreasing catalyst seems counterintuitive

3. Technical Considerations:
- Lower temperatures can:
  a) Reduce reaction rate
  b) Shift chemical equilibrium
  c) Potentially improve conversion by changing reaction kinetics
- Increasing catalyst amount can:
  a) Provide more active sites
  b) Enhance reaction efficiency

4. Critical Observation:
- Option C provides the most comprehensive approach
- Acknowledges potential polymerization risk
- Suggests systematic investigation of temperature and catalyst effects
- Maintains scientific rigor and problem-solving approach

5. Reasoning Conclusion:
The most scientifically sound approach is to carefully investigate temperature reduction and catalyst increase while being aware of potential side reactions.
