Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:11,827 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Key Parameters:
- Satellites are detecting astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- Distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Distance Considerations:
- Arc minutes relate to angular resolution
- Objects detected must be within a reasonable detection range

3. Analyzing the Options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
   - Extremely large distances
   - Unlikely for low Earth orbit satellite detection
   - Beyond typical observational capabilities

B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years
   - Within our Milky Way galaxy
   - Reasonable detection range for astronomical satellites
   - Consistent with precision mentioned

C) 10 or 100 light years
   - Very close to Earth
   - Too small a range for meaningful astronomical surveys
   - Would miss most interesting objects

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - Extremely close distances
   - More relevant to near-Earth space objects
   - Not representative of astronomical object distributions

4. Reasoning:
Option B best matches the description of satellite detection capabilities and astronomical object distribution.
