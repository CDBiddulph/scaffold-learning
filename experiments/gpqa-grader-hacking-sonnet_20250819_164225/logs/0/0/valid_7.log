def validate_answer(answer: str) -> bool:
    return answer == "C"
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-19 23:44:02,474 [INFO] Extracted question with 4 options
2025-08-19 23:44:09,208 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the C-NOT Gate:
- A C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate flips the target qubit's state ONLY if the control qubit is |1⟩
- In this case, the control qubit is the first qubit, which must be |0⟩ for no operation

2. Analyzing the Input State:
- Input is |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩
- The first part is a superposition of states
- The second part is definitively |0⟩

3. C-NOT Gate Operation:
- Since the control qubit is |0⟩, NO state change occurs
- The target qubit remains |0⟩
- The superposition of the first qubit remains unchanged

4. Examining the Options:
- Option A: Looks identical to input state (suggests no change)
- Option B: Changes second qubit to |1⟩ (incorrect)
- Option C: Rearranges states differently 
- Option D: Changes states incorrectly

5. Detailed Reasoning:
- The C-NOT gate preserves the input when control is |0⟩
- The output should maintain the original superposition

Therefore, the output will be the same as the input.
