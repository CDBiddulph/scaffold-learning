A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:44:09,386 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Problem:
- We have a light beam propagating through a moving glass medium
- The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
- Speed of light in vacuum is c=1
- We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer

2. Conceptual Considerations:
- This is a relativistic problem involving moving media
- We'll use the relativistic velocity transformation formula
- The key is understanding how the motion of the medium affects light's observed speed

3. Relativistic Velocity Transformation:
- When a medium moves relative to an observer, the light's speed changes
- The formula involves the refractive index (n) and the velocity of the medium (v)
- The standard relativistic transformation is: (c + v) / (1 + v/c)

4. Substituting Given Values:
- c = 1 in this problem
- Substituting and algebraically simplifying leads to: (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

5. Checking the Options:
- Option D exactly matches our derived expression
- This confirms (1 + n*v) / (n + v) is the correct velocity transformation

Final Answer: D
