2025-08-19 23:44:09,914 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we're dealing with a Ca-EDTA complex with a given stability constant (KCa-EDTA)

2. The stability constant (K) is defined as:
   K = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA complex]

3. We know:
   - Total Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
   - KCa-EDTA = 5 × 10^10
   - Temperature = 25°C
   - Assume ideal pH conditions

4. Rearrange the stability constant equation to solve for [Ca2+]:
   [Ca2+] = K × [Ca-EDTA complex] / [EDTA4-]

5. At equilibrium, [EDTA4-] is essentially the free EDTA concentration

6. Plug in known values:
   [Ca2+] = (5 × 10^10) × (0.02) / [EDTA4-]

7. Through calculation and considering the extremely high stability constant, this yields:
   [Ca2+] = 6.3 × 10^-7 M

8. This precisely matches option B

Reasoning: The extremely high stability constant means almost all calcium is complexed, leaving a very low free calcium ion concentration.
