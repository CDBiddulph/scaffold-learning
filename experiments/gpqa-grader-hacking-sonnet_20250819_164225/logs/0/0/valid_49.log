bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-19 23:44:11,804 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting Material Analysis:
- The molecule is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
- It contains a rigid bicyclic ring system with a ketone group

2. First Transformation (UV Irradiation):
- UV radiation typically induces photochemical reactions
- The molecular weight remains the same
- This suggests a [2+2] photocycloaddition, likely creating a cyclobutanone derivative

3. Second Transformation (Pd/H2):
- Hydrogenation with palladium on carbon typically reduces carbonyl groups
- This will convert the cyclobutanone to a cyclobutanol
- The hydrogenation might introduce a new stereocenter

4. NMR Splitting Pattern Prediction:
- The most deshielded hydrogen will likely be the alcohol proton
- In a cyclic system with neighboring hydrogens
- This suggests a triplet splitting pattern due to coupling with adjacent hydrogens

5. Reasoning for Triplet:
- The alcohol proton will have two equivalent neighboring hydrogen environments
- This creates a symmetric coupling, resulting in a triplet signal
