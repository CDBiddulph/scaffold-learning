2025-08-19 23:44:06,149 [INFO] Extracted question with 4 options
2025-08-19 23:44:14,033 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the magnitude equation:
• Apparent magnitude depends on both absolute magnitude and distance
• m = M + 5 log(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) 7 mag at 50 parsecs: 
• This is just a given apparent magnitude
• Relative distance is moderate

b) 7 mag at 20 parsecs:
• This appears brighter due to closer distance
• Will be brighter than option (a)

c) Two-star system at 5 parsecs:
• System includes stars at Vmag 7 and 8
• Very close distance will make these appear very bright
• Combined system brightness will be significant

d) Absolute magnitude of 7 at 10 parsecs:
• At standard reference distance
• If absolute magnitude is 7, apparent magnitude will equal absolute magnitude

e) Two-star system with absolute magnitudes at 10 parsecs:
• Complex calculation needed
• Stars at absolute magnitude 7 and 8

f) Two identical absolute magnitude stars at 10 parsecs:
• Two identical stars at absolute magnitude 7
• At standard reference distance
• Combined brightness will be brighter than single star

3) Comparing brightness requires calculating apparent magnitudes or understanding combined stellar luminosity.

4) Option (f) stands out: identical stars at standard distance, which means their combined brightness will be significantly brighter than single star options.
