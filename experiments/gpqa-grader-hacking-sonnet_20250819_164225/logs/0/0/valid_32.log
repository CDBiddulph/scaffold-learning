We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-19 23:44:04,311 [INFO] Extracted question with 4 options
2025-08-19 23:44:11,944 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial System Analysis:
- Initial concentrations: [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M, [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
- pH = 1.0
- Standard reduction potential (E0) for Fe(III)/Fe(II) = 0.77 V
- Total phosphate concentration = 0.1 M
- [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
- Complex formation constant for Fe(III)-H2PO4^- = 10^21

2. Nernst Equation Considerations:
- We need to calculate the redox potential considering complex formation
- Complex formation will significantly impact the Fe(III)/Fe(II) equilibrium

3. Complex Formation Effects:
- High complex formation constant (10^21) indicates strong Fe(III)-H2PO4^- binding
- This will effectively remove free Fe(III) ions from solution
- Reduced free Fe(III) concentration shifts the redox potential

4. Redox Potential Calculation:
- Using Nernst equation: E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])
- Complexation dramatically reduces effective [Fe(III)]
- This leads to a significant negative shift in potential

5. Numerical Analysis:
- The complex formation effectively decreases [Fe(III)] available
- Based on the complex formation constant and concentrations
- This results in a potential around -0.34 V

6. Verification:
- The systematic reduction in Fe(III) availability
- Strong phosphate complexation
- Supports the calculated potential of -0.34 V
