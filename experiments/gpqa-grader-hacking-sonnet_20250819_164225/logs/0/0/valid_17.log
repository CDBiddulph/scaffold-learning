Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:10,433 [INFO] LLM response: I'll solve this systematically by analyzing the molecular formulas, NMR signals, and reaction details:

Step 1: Molecular Formula Analysis
- A(C6H13Br): 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane
- B(C4H6): but-1-yne
- C(C10H18): Resulting product after reaction

Step 2: NMR Signal Interpretation
- A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests symmetry and alkyl groups
- B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) indicates unsaturated hydrocarbon
- C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests complex structure

Step 3: Reaction Type Analysis
- The reaction involves a bromoalkane (A) and an alkyne (B)
- Nucleophilic substitution is most likely mechanism
- The product will involve carbon-carbon bond formation

Step 4: Structural Reasoning
- 1-Bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane will act as electrophile
- But-1-yne will act as nucleophile
- Resulting product: 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne

Step 5: Verification
- Matches molecular formula C10H18
- NMR signals consistent with proposed structure

Based on this systematic analysis, the reaction matches Option B's description.
