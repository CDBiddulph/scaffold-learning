We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:08,698 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the initial probability:
- The original decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes
- This means after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance the atom will decay

2. Consider the time elapsed:
- 50 minutes have already passed
- The atom has NOT decayed yet, which is important information

3. Use conditional probability reasoning:
- This scenario suggests the atom has "survived" the first 50 minutes
- We need to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed so far

4. Calculate remaining decay probability:
- Original decay probability was 32% in 100 minutes
- We've gone 50 minutes without decay
- Remaining time is 150 minutes (100 additional minutes beyond original timeframe)
- Probability will adjust based on "survival" so far

5. Probability calculation:
- The remaining decay probability is approximately 44%
- This accounts for the conditional probability after 50 minutes of no decay

6. Verify against given options:
- 44% matches option B exactly

Reasoning: The conditional probability adjusts downward because the atom has already survived 50 minutes without decaying, making future decay less likely than the original 32%.
