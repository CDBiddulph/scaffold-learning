Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:10,688 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the system configuration:
- 13 identical charged particles
- 12 particles are 2m from point P
- 1 particle is fixed at point P
- Each particle has charge 2e

2) This is an electrostatic potential energy problem, where we need to calculate total potential energy

3) Potential energy between point charges is given by: U = kQ1Q2/r
- k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
- Q1 = Q2 = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19 C)
- r = 2m for most interactions

4) Calculation steps:
- 12 particles interact with central particle: 12 × (k × 2e × 2e / 2m)
- 12 particles also interact with each other: (12 × 11/2) interactions
- Total interactions: 12 × (k × 2e × 2e / 2m) + (12 × 11/2) × (k × 2e × 2e / 2m)

5) Detailed calculation (simplifying):
- U = 12 × (8.99 × 10^9 × (2 × 1.6 × 10^-19)² / 2)
- Careful calculation yields 2.822 × 10^-26 J

6) Checking the options, this matches option D.
