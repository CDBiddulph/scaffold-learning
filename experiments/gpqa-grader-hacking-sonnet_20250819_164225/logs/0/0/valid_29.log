Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:44:05,024 [INFO] Extracted question with 4 options
2025-08-19 23:44:11,917 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically Active Requirements:
- An optically active molecule must have a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- This means the molecule cannot have a plane of symmetry
- Requires at least one carbon with 4 different substituents

2. Hydrocarbon Composition Analysis:
- All options are saturated hydrocarbons (no double/triple bonds)
- Need to determine molecular structure and symmetry

3. Analyzing Mass Spectrometry (EI-MS) Fragments:
- High m/z values suggest more complex/larger molecules
- Key fragmentation patterns indicate branched structures

4. Detailed Option Evaluation:
- Option A (m/z = 72): Likely a straight-chain molecule
- Option B (m/z = 86): Possible small branched structure
- Option C (m/z = 58): Smaller, simpler molecule
- Option D (m/z = 100): Most complex fragment pattern

5. Chirality Assessment:
- Option D's high m/z suggests a branched structure
- Fragmentation suggests a molecule like 2-methylbutane
- This molecule has a chiral center at the second carbon
- Meets optically active requirements

Therefore:
Final Answer: D
