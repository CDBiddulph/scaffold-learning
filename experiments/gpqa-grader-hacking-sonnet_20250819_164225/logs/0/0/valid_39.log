ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-19 23:44:12,780 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Experimental Setup:
- ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing) is used to identify protein-DNA interactions
- Here, the target is the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells
- Two different fixation methods were used: PFA alone vs. PFA+DSG
- Peaks disappeared when DSG was added to PFA fixation

2. Analyzing Fixation Methods:
- PFA (Paraformaldehyde) typically cross-links proteins to DNA
- DSG (Disuccinimidyl glutarate) adds additional protein-protein cross-linking
- The disappearance of peaks suggests DSG disrupts some protein-DNA interactions

3. Characteristics of Transcription Factor Binding:
- IKAROS is a key transcription factor in B cell development
- Transcription factors predominantly bind:
  a) Promoters (gene start regions)
  b) Enhancers (regulatory regions)
  c) Active regulatory elements

4. Peak Disappearance Analysis:
- Disappearing peaks likely represent:
  - Weak or transient interactions
  - Protein complexes sensitive to additional cross-linking
- Most consistent with active regulatory regions

5. Reasoning for Active Promoters/Enhancers:
- These regions have dynamic protein interactions
- More sensitive to cross-linking disruption
- Involve multiple protein complexes
