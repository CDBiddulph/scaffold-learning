Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:10,363 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

2. In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop momentum integral.

3. The loop momentum integral contributes a factor that scales with the number of loops. Typically, each loop adds a factor of the form 1/(4π)^n.

4. In the given expression, we see 1/(4π)^6 term

5. The general pattern for loop power is 1/(4π)^(2L), where L is the number of loops

6. We can solve this by setting up the equation:
   2L = 6
   L = 6/2 = 3

7. This means the diagram contains 3 loops.

8. Checking the answer choices, 3 corresponds to option D.

9. The other details like alpha, g, sqrt(2), (Q/M)^2 are just coupling constants and energy scale ratios, which don't directly affect the loop count.
