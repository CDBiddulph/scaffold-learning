The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-19 23:44:12,118 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law, which relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   • Temperature is inversely proportional to peak wavelength/energy
   • Peak energy ∝ 1/Temperature

2) Star A peak energy: 7.21 eV
   Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV

3) Relative temperature calculation:
   Temperature ratio = 1.41 eV / 7.21 eV = 0.196 (about 0.19)
   This means Star A is much hotter than the sun

4) Use Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity ∝ (Radius)² × (Temperature)⁴
   • Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun
   • Let R = Radius of Star A relative to sun's radius

5) Rearrange Stefan-Boltzmann equation:
   24 = R² × (0.196)⁴

6) Solve for R:
   R² = 24 / (0.196)⁴
   R = √(24 / (0.196)⁴)
   R ≈ 0.19

7) This matches option B perfectly.
