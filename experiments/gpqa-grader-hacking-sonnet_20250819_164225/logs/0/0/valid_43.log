You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-19 23:44:06,130 [INFO] Extracted question with 4 options
2025-08-19 23:44:13,440 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Understand the Expression Vector's Multiple Cloning Site (MCS):
- MCS has sites: SmaI, HindIII, BglII, KpnI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI
- We want to use two different restriction sites for directional cloning

2. Analyze the Primer Sequences:
- Primers are in 5' to 3' direction
- First part of sequence is the recognition sequence for a restriction enzyme
- Second part matches the start/end of the gene sequence

3. Consider the Restriction Enzyme Requirements:
- Need two different enzymes that are in the MCS
- Enzymes must create compatible overhangs for directional cloning
- Must maintain correct reading frame

4. Evaluate the Options:
- Forward primer starts with HindIII (AAGCTT)
- Reverse primer needs a different enzyme site that's also in the MCS

5. Detailed Option Analysis:
- Option A: HindIII and KpnI - These are in the MCS ✓
- Option B: HindIII and BamHI - These are in the MCS ✓
- Option C: SmaI and BamHI - Not ideal for directional cloning
- Option D: BamHI and HindIII - Reverse of option B

6. Choose the Best Option:
- Option B provides directional cloning
- HindIII at start ensures correct orientation
- BamHI at end provides second unique site
- Primers flank entire gene sequence

Final Answer: B
