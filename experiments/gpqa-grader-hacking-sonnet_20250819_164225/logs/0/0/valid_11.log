All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:44:11,806 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Option A: Pseudoknot Frameshifting
- Discusses the relationship between pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting rates
- Claims both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 show two conformations under tension
- Seems scientifically plausible and technically sound

2. Option B: nsp10/nsp14-ExoN Mechanism
- Describes a heterodimer complex for mismatch repair
- Suggests N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds to nsp10
- However, this statement suggests the complex prevents dsRNA breakdown, which seems counterintuitive to RNA viral replication
- This statement appears potentially incorrect

3. Option C: ORF3a and Apoptosis
- Describes caspase-8 activation via ORF3a
- Explains mechanism through extrinsic apoptotic pathway
- Consistent with known viral protein mechanisms
- Seems scientifically accurate

4. Option D: Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting
- Describes the mechanism of creating polyproteins
- Claims SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has same conformation as SARS-CoV
- Appears technically correct based on current understanding

5. Identifying the Exception:
- Options A, C, and D appear scientifically sound
- Option B contains a potentially problematic mechanism description about preventing dsRNA breakdown

Final Answer: B

Reasoning: Option B seems to describe an unlikely mechanism where the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex prevents dsRNA breakdown, which would be counterproductive to viral replication. The other options provide accurate descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology mechanisms.
