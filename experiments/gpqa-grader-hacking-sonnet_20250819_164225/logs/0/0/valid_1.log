Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:02,474 [INFO] Extracted question with 4 options
2025-08-19 23:44:09,368 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand Caesium-137 decay characteristics:
- Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope
- It emits gamma rays during radioactive decay
- Half-life is approximately 30 years
- Each atom will emit gamma rays probabilistically

2. Calculate total gamma ray emissions:
- Total atoms: 10^17
- Each atom emits multiple gamma rays per decay
- Typical gamma ray emission rate: ~1-2 gamma rays per decay
- Estimate: ~10^17 to 2×10^17 total potential gamma rays

3. Consider detector parameters:
- Detector size: 2x3 cm = 6 cm²
- Distance from source: 4 meters
- Solid angle calculation reduces detected rays
- Detector will capture a fraction of total emissions

4. Time factor:
- Measurement period: 80 minutes
- Significant decay and emission will occur
- Realistic detection range: 10^5 to 10^7 gamma rays

5. Best estimate range:
- Considering detector efficiency and decay probability
- Most likely scenario: ~10^6 gamma rays detected

6. Cross-reference with options:
- Option A (10^4): Too low
- Option B (10^8): Too high
- Option C (10^6): Matches calculation
- Option D (10^2): Far too low

Final Answer: C
