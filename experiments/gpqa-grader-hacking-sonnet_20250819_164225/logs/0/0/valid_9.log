2025-08-19 23:44:08,595 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the structure of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid:
   - It's a cyclohexene derivative
   - Contains a formyl group (-CHO)
   - Contains a vinyl group (-CH=CH2)
   - Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

2. Reaction conditions:
   - Red phosphorus and excess HI (hydrogen iodide)
   - This is a reducing/deiodination reaction

3. Reaction mechanism:
   - Red phosphorus and HI will reduce:
     a) The formyl group to a methyl group
     b) The vinyl group to an ethyl group
     c) Reduce and deiodinate the molecule

4. Hydrogen deficiency index calculation:
   - Hydrogen deficiency index = Number of rings + Number of double bonds
   - After reduction, one ring remains
   - No double bonds remain after complete reduction

5. Calculating the hydrogen deficiency index:
   - Rings: 1
   - Double bonds: 0
   - Hydrogen deficiency index = 1 + 0 = 1

Therefore, the hydrogen deficiency index is 1.
