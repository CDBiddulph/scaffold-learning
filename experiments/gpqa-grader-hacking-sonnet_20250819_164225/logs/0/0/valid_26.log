2025-08-19 23:44:10,993 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Black hole entropy is related to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:
   S = kA/4L²
   Where:
   - k is Boltzmann's constant
   - A is the area of the event horizon
   - L is the Planck length

2) First, calculate the radius of the event horizon:
   - Angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees
   - Distance d = 10^10 parsecs
   - Radius = θ * d * (π/180)
   - Radius ≈ 10^-17 * 10^10 * (π/180) ≈ 10^-7 m

3) Surface area of the event horizon:
   - A = 4πr²
   - A ≈ 4π * (10^-7)² ≈ 10^-13 m²

4) Entropy calculation:
   - S = (k/4L²) * A
   - Planck length L ≈ 10^-35 m
   - S ≈ (k/4(10^-35)²) * 10^-13
   - S ≈ 10^62 J/K

5) Comparing with the given options, this matches option C.
