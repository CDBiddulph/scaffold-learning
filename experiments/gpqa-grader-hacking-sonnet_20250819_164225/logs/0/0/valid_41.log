2025-08-19 23:44:12,153 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key information:
- We have a textile dye with conjugated π-electrons
- The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV
- We need to determine the color of light ABSORBED by the compound

2. Recall the relationship between light energy and color:
- Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
- The visible spectrum ranges from ~1.5 eV (red) to ~3.1 eV (violet)

3. Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:
- E = hc/λ
- h (Planck's constant) = 4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s
- c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
- λ = (hc)/E = (4.136 × 10^-15 × 3 × 10^8) / 2.3393
- λ ≈ 530 nm (green-yellow region)

4. Color absorption principle:
- A substance absorbs the complementary color to what it emits
- Complementary to green-yellow is violet-blue

5. Comparing the options:
- Violet fits best with the complementary color reasoning

Therefore, the color of light absorbed by this organic compound is Violet.
