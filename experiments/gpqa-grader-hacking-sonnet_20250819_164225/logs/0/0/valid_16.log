A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-19 23:44:10,922 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Scenario:
- A scientist performed gene editing on a 1-cell fertilized egg using CRISPR-Cas9
- The resulting transgenic animal showed different genomes in different cell lineages
- This indicates genome modification occurred at multiple stages of embryo development

2. Analyzing the Mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9:
- Cas9 is a protein that cuts DNA at specific locations guided by guide RNA
- The presence of donor DNA allows for targeted genetic replacement
- The key issue is how genome modification happened across different cell stages

3. Evaluating Option D in Detail:
- If Cas9 protein remains active during embryo development
- It could continue cutting DNA at target sites
- This would allow donor DNA incorporation at different developmental stages
- This progressive modification would result in different cell lineages having different genomic sequences

4. Ruling Out Other Options:
- Option A: cDNA conversion is unlikely and not a standard CRISPR mechanism
- Option B: Guide RNA-donor complex incorporation is not a typical mechanism
- Option C: Surrogate mother DNA introduction is improbable

5. Rationale for Option D:
- Continuous Cas9 activity explains the mosaic genetic changes
- Matches the observation of genomic differences across cell lineages
- Reflects known potential limitation of CRISPR gene editing in early embryos
