Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:09,443 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the Problem:
- We have 4 different particles
- Each particle is produced at a different speed
- We want to determine which particles reach the ground in 1e-5s

2. Calculate Distance Traveled by Each Particle:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Time is fixed at 1e-5s
- We'll compare the distances traveled

3. Calculate Distances:
- Zeta: 0.96c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 288 meters
- Eta: 0.9c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 270 meters
- Chi: 0.88c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 264 meters
- Lambda: 0.93c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 279 meters

4. Order by Distance (Descending):
- Zeta (288m) > Lambda (279m) > Eta (270m) > Chi (264m)

5. Cross-Check with Particle Order Options

Reasoning matches option B: zeta > lambda > eta > chi

Final Answer: B
