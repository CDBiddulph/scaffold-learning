Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:44:12,410 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Data
- Hi-C (50M cells) shows a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- Linear distance between them is ~1 Mb
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by 20%

2. Analysis of Potential Reasons
- FISH is generally less sensitive than Hi-C for detecting genomic interactions
- A 20% reduction in expression suggests a real functional interaction exists
- 1 Mb is typically within FISH detection range
- False positives in Hi-C can occur due to technical artifacts

3. Evaluating Each Option
A) Low interaction frequency: Plausible - Hi-C is more sensitive than FISH
B) Structural variation altering distance: Less likely given specific distance
C) Distance too short for FISH: Incorrect - 1 Mb is typically detectable
D) Hi-C false positive: Possible, but functional reduction suggests real interaction

4. Reasoning Conclusion
- The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low for FISH detection
- The functional KRAB effect supports a genuine but weak interaction
- Hi-C's higher cell population and sensitivity can detect rare interactions
