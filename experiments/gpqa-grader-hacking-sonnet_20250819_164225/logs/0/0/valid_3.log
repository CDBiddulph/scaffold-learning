d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b
D) d

2025-08-19 23:44:08,987 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding Density
- Density = Mass / Volume
- For a planet with consistent composition, density remains constant
- Changes in mass/volume will affect the overall planet's density

2. Analyzing Option A (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet)
- This planet would have the exact same density as Earth
- Density would be approximately 5.5 g/cm^3
- Baseline comparison point

3. Analyzing Option B (2 Earth masses, stated density of 5.5 g/cm^3)
- No clear change in density
- Mass increased, but likely proportional volume increase

4. Analyzing Option C (Same composition, 5x Earth's mass)
- If composition is identical, volume would scale proportionally with mass
- This means density remains constant at 5.5 g/cm^3
- However, the planet would be much larger and more massive

5. Analyzing Option D (Same composition, half Earth's mass)
- Smaller mass and volume
- Density would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm^3
- Smallest overall planet

6. Comparative Analysis
- All options maintain approximately the same density (5.5 g/cm^3)
- No significant density differentiation

7. Concluding Reasoning
- Option C represents the largest planet with consistent density
- Larger mass suggests more extreme planetary characteristics
