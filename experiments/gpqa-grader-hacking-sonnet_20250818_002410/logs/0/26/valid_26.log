2025-08-18 11:03:24,406 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and l_p is the Planck length

2) Angular size is related to the actual size of the black hole:
   θ = 2R/d
   Where R is the radius of the black hole and d is the distance

3) From the given information:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

4) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3.086 × 10^16 meters
   d = 10^10 × (3.086 × 10^16) = 3.086 × 10^26 meters

5) Rearrange the angular size formula to find radius:
   R = (θ × d) / 2
   R = (10^-17 × 3.086 × 10^26) / 2
   R ≈ 10^5 meters

6) Surface area of the event horizon:
   A = 4πR²
   A ≈ 4π(10^5)² = 4π × 10^10 ≈ 10^11 m²

7) Entropy calculation:
   S ≈ (k × 10^11) / (4 × (Planck length)²)
   This will be of order 10^62 J/K

8) This matches option C.
