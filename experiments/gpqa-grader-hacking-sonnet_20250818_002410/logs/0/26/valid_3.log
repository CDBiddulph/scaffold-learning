2025-08-18 11:03:03,440 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's recall the definition of density:
   • Density = Mass / Volume
   • Density increases if mass increases while volume remains constant
   • Density also increases if volume decreases while mass remains constant

2. Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
   • This is essentially identical to Earth's density (about 5.5 g/cm³)
   • No change in density

3. Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and density of 5.5 g/cm³
   • This seems to have a fixed density, independent of mass
   • Likely not the highest density

4. Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive
   • Same composition means same material density
   • More mass implies larger radius proportional to the cube root of mass
   • This would actually result in a slightly lower overall density

5. Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass
   • Smaller mass implies smaller radius
   • Smaller volume means higher density
   • This would result in a higher density than the original Earth

6. Comparing the options, option d has the highest potential density.
