Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 11:03:23,378 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. To be optically active, a molecule must:
• Contain a carbon atom with 4 different substituents
• Lack a plane of symmetry
• Have a chiral center

2. Let's calculate the molecular formula for each option:
A) C5H12 (pentane)
B) C6H14 (hexane)
C) C4H8 (butane)
D) C7H16 (heptane)

3. Optically active carbon requires a carbon with 4 different groups attached.

4. Analyzing each molecule:
A) Pentane - linear, symmetrical, no chiral center
B) Hexane - linear, symmetrical, no chiral center
C) Butane - linear, symmetrical, no chiral center
D) Heptane - possible chiral center at the 3rd or 4th carbon if branched

5. The molecular mass and fragmentation patterns suggest option D represents a branched alkane, likely 3-methylhexane.

6. 3-methylhexane has a chiral center at the 3rd carbon, making it optically active.

Answer: D
