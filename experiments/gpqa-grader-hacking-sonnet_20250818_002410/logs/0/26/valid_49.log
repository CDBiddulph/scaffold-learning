bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

2025-08-18 11:03:43,752 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, a ketone in a rigid bicyclic system

2. UV irradiation likely causes photochemical reaction, probably a [2+2] photocycloaddition
• This would form a new cyclobutane ring
• Molecular weight remains the same (consistent with problem statement)

3. Palladium on carbon under hydrogen suggests hydrogenation
• This will likely reduce any unsaturation created in the photochemical step
• Will convert strained ring systems to more saturated structures

4. The most deshielded hydrogen will likely be near the carbonyl region after these transformations

5. After hydrogenation, the local environment of this hydrogen will determine its NMR splitting pattern
• If this hydrogen is adjacent to two non-equivalent hydrogens, it would show a doublet of doublets
• If it's isolated or symmetrically situated, it might show a different pattern

6. Carefully considering the molecular transformation suggests the most deshielded hydrogen will have two different neighboring hydrogens

7. This means the splitting pattern would be a doublet of doublets
