The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-18 11:03:42,165 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law: Peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature
   - Star A peak: 7.21 eV
   - Sun's peak: 1.41 eV

2) Temperature ratio calculation:
   T(A)/T(sun) = 1.41/7.21 = 0.196

3) Luminosity relationship:
   L(A) = 24 * L(sun)

4) Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 
   L ∝ R²T⁴

5) Rearranging to solve for radius:
   R(A)/R(sun) = √(L(A)/L(sun)) * (T(sun)/T(A))²

6) Substituting known values:
   R(A)/R(sun) = √24 * (1/0.196)²
               = √24 * (5.10)²
               = √24 * 26
               = √624
               = 0.19

7) This matches option B.
