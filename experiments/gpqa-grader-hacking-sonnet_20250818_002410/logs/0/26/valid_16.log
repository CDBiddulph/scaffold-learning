A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 11:03:14,350 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what the scenario describes:
- A 1-cell fertilized egg was injected with Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA
- The resulting animal has different genomes in different cell lineages
- This suggests genetic modification did not occur uniformly during embryo development

2. Analyze option A:
- Converting messenger RNA to cDNA and genome incorporation is possible
- This could explain non-uniform genetic modification
- However, this is not the most likely explanation

3. Analyze option B:
- Guide RNA-donor DNA complex integration is plausible
- Could potentially occur at different embryonic developmental stages
- This mechanism could explain mosaic genetic modification

4. Analyze option C:
- Accidentally incorporating surrogate mother's DNA seems improbable
- No clear mechanism for this to occur
- Less likely explanation

5. Analyze option D:
- Continuous DNA cutting by Cas9 protein could cause:
  * Repeated DNA breaks
  * Potentially different donor DNA insertions at different stages
- This mechanism could result in mosaic genetic modification

6. Conclusion:
- Option D provides the most probable explanation for non-uniform genetic modification during embryo development
