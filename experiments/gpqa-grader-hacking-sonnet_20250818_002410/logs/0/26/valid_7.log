There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 11:03:03,545 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall how a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate works:
   • If the control qubit (first qubit) is |0⟩, the target qubit (second qubit) remains unchanged
   • If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In the given input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩, the first condition is explicitly stated:
   • The first qubit must be in state |0⟩

3) When the control qubit is |0⟩, the C-NOT gate does nothing to the target qubit

4) Therefore, the output state will be exactly the same as the input state:
   |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

5) Looking at the given options, this matches option A exactly.

Answer: A

Let's verify the key points:
• Control qubit is |0⟩ ✓
• Target qubit remains |0⟩ ✓
• First qubit's state is unchanged ✓
