Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:33,857 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the forces involved:
• The attractive force is likely gravity
• The repulsive force is likely electrostatic (electromagnetic) repulsion

2) Recall the key formulas:
• Gravitational force: F_g = G(m1m2)/r²
• Electrostatic force: F_e = k(q1q2)/r²

3) We're told these are particles with the smallest attainable charge and mass
• This suggests fundamental particles like electrons or quarks

4) The key point is the distance: 137 meters

5) Comparing the force formulas, the critical difference is how the force depends on distance
• Both follow an inverse square law (1/r²)

6) The ratio will depend on the constants in the formulas
• But the distance of 137 meters suggests r = 137

7) The electrostatic force/gravitational force ratio for fundamental particles is enormously large
• In fact, it's about 10^37 times stronger

8) Looking at the options, 137² (which is 18,769) is much too small

9) The option that matches the 1/r relationship is 1/137²
