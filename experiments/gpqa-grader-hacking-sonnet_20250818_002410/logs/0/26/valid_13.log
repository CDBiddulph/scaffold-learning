2025-08-18 11:03:14,569 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT stands for:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• This is a framework for describing physics beyond the Standard Model

2. Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):
• Fundamental symmetry of spacetime
• Essential for any relativistic quantum field theory
• MUST be respected by SMEFT
• Definitely included

3. Poincare Symmetry (Option 2):
• Includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
• A broader symmetry that contains Lorentz symmetry
• Also MUST be respected by SMEFT
• Definitely included

4. CP Symmetry (Option 3):
• Combined charge conjugation and parity symmetry
• Not a fundamental requirement for SMEFT
• Can be violated in some extensions
• Optional, not mandatory

5. CPT Symmetry (Option 4):
• Fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories
• Relates particles and antiparticles
• Considered a very fundamental symmetry
• MUST be respected by SMEFT

6. Combining these insights:
• Options 1, 2, and 4 are mandatory
• Option 3 is not required

Therefore, the answer matches option A.
