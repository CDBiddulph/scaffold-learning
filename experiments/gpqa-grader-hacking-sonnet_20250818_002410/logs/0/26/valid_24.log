Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:23,789 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. We need to calculate how far each particle travels in 1e-5s.

2. Distance = Speed × Time
   Time is constant at 1e-5s for all particles

3. Let's calculate distance for each particle:
• Zeta: Speed = 0.96c
   Distance = 0.96 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 28,800 m

• Eta: Speed = 0.9c
   Distance = 0.9 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 27,000 m

• Chi: Speed = 0.88c
   Distance = 0.88 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 26,400 m

• Lambda: Speed = 0.93c
   Distance = 0.93 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1 × 10^-5 s) = 27,900 m

4. Ground level is at 13,000m, so compare distances:
• Zeta: 28,800 m > 13,000 m ✓
• Lambda: 27,900 m > 13,000 m ✓
• Eta: 27,000 m > 13,000 m ✓
• Chi: 26,400 m > 13,000 m ✓

5. Ordering from most to least: Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi
