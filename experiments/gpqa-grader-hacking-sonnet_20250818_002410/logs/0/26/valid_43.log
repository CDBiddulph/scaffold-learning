You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 11:03:41,814 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, analyze the vector's multiple cloning site (MCS):
- Contains HindIII, KpnI, and BamHI sites
- We want a directional cloning strategy

2. Examine the primer sequences:
- Each primer has unique restriction enzyme sites at the start
- First sequence starts with 5'-amplicon sequence
- Reverse primer has a complementary end

3. Requirements for correct cloning:
- Forward primer needs to add HindIII site for 5' end
- Reverse primer needs to add BamHI site for 3' end
- These sites ensure directional cloning

4. Checking the options:
- Option A: HindIII forward, KpnI reverse (incorrect)
- Option B: HindIII forward, BamHI reverse (correct!)
- Option C: SmaI forward, BamHI reverse (incorrect)
- Option D: BamHI forward, HindIII reverse (incorrect)

5. Option B meets both criteria:
- Adds HindIII at 5' end
- Adds BamHI at 3' end
- Will allow directional cloning in the vector's MCS

Answer: B
