2025-08-18 11:03:04,463 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   • Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
   • Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5 × 10^10
   • Temperature = 25 °C
   • We need to find the calcium ion concentration

2) The stability constant relates to the equilibrium:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

3) The stability constant is defined as:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5) Under the given conditions, we can assume [EDTA⁴⁻] ≈ [Ca-EDTA]

6) Substituting values:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10^10) × (0.02) / (0.02)

7) Calculating:
   [Ca²⁺] = 5 × 10^10 × 1 = 5 × 10^10 × 10^-2
           = 6.3 × 10^-7 M

8) This matches option B.
