Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:14,599 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
   - 13 total charges, all equal to 2e
   - 12 charges are at a distance of 2m from point P
   - 1 charge is at point P

2) Calculate the potential energy between the charges:
   - Coulomb's constant, k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
   - Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) Energy between the charge at P and the 12 other charges:
   - Each charge will have the same potential energy due to symmetry
   - Energy = k × (charge at P) × (charge of other charges) / distance
   - E = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2
   = 2.822 × 10^-26 J

4) Energy between the 12 other charges is zero due to symmetric arrangement

5) Checking the options, 2.822 × 10^-26 matches option D
