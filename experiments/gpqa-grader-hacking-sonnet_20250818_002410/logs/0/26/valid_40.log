A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 11:03:42,154 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the scenario:
   - Light beam is propagating through a moving glass
   - Speed of light in vacuum is 1
   - Glass index of refraction is n
   - Glass is moving at velocity v in the direction of light beam

2) We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer

3) In a stationary medium, the speed of light is c/n

4) However, the glass is moving, which will affect the observed speed of light

5) This is similar to the relativistic velocity addition formula

6) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   (u + v) / (1 + u*v/cÂ²)

7) In our case, u = c/n and c = 1, so we substitute:
   (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)*v)

8) Substituting c = 1:
   (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)

9) Cross multiply and simplify, this becomes:
   (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

10) Looking at the answer choices, this matches option D
