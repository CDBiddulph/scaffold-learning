All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 11:03:14,791 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement carefully:

A) This statement discusses the frameshifting rate and pseudoknot conformations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The description seems scientifically accurate and consistent with current molecular biology understanding.

B) This statement describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex as a heterodimer involved in mismatch repair. The mechanism of preventing dsRNA breakdown appears to be a correct representation of current scientific knowledge about this viral protein complex.

C) This statement details the mechanism of ORF3a-induced apoptosis through caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The description of the molecular mechanism and the specific role of caspase-8 and Bcl-2 seems scientifically sound.

D) This statement contains a subtle error. While the description of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is generally correct, the claim that "SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting" is not entirely accurate.

Research has shown that while there are similarities, the frameshifting mechanisms of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are not exactly the same. There are nuanced differences in the pseudoknot structures and frameshifting efficiencies between the two viruses.

Therefore, statement D contains an inaccuracy that makes it the exception to the correct statements.
