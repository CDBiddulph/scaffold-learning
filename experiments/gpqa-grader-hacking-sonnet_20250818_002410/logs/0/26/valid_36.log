Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:34,135 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key information:
• Satellites detect astronomical objects
• Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
• Distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Arc minutes relate to angular measurement, not distance directly
• But angular resolution suggests ability to detect objects at significant distances

3. Evaluating the options:
A) 1 million/1 billion light years
• Extremely large cosmic scales
• Consistent with detecting astronomical objects across vast distances
• Matches the broad, isotropic detection capability

B) 1 thousand/100 thousand light years
• Galactic/local group scales
• Reasonable, but potentially too limited for broad detection

C) 10/100 light years
• Very local, solar neighborhood scale
• Too small for broad astronomical object detection

D) 10 light minutes/100 light seconds
• Very close range, within solar system
• Far too small for astronomical object detection

4. Reasoning:
• The isotropic distribution and broad detection suggest cosmic-scale distances
• This points strongly to large-scale astronomical observations

5. Final analysis favors option A.
