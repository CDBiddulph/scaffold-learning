2025-08-18 11:03:24,805 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and distance:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 * log10(Distance/10 parsecs)

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) Apparent magnitude 7 at 50 parsecs:
   This is already a measured apparent magnitude

b) Apparent magnitude 7 at 20 parsecs:
   This is already a measured apparent magnitude

c) Two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 at 5 parsecs:
   Need to calculate the combined apparent magnitude
   For this, we can use the formula: m_combined = -2.5 * log10(10^(-m1/2.5) + 10^(-m2/2.5))
   = -2.5 * log10(10^(-7/2.5) + 10^(-8/2.5))
   â‰ˆ 6.4 mag

d) Absolute magnitude 7 at 10 parsecs:
   By definition, this star will have an apparent magnitude of 7

e) Two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 at 10 parsecs:
   Similar calculation as (c), but the result will be brighter

f) Two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 at 10 parsecs:
   Both stars are identical, so this will have a lower combined magnitude than a single star

3) Comparing the options, the brightest (lowest magnitude) will be option C.
