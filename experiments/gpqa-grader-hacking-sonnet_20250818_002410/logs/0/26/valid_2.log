In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:02,818 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the TLC result:
• The students found A spots under UV light
• This suggests the presence of:
   - Starting material
   - Product
   - Solvent
• So A = three spots

2. Let's calculate the percentage yield:
• Initial amount of benzoic acid = 10 g
• Product recovered = 4 g
• Starting material recovered = 3 g
• Total mass of product and starting material = 4 g + 3 g = 7 g

3. Theoretical yield calculation:
• If the reaction was complete, the starting material (10 g) would be converted to product
• The theoretical yield is 10 g

4. Percentage yield calculation:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%
• Percentage yield = (4 g / 10 g) × 100%
• Percentage yield = 0.4 × 100% = 40%
• Closest option is 44.44%

5. Checking the options:
• Three spots (A = three)
• 44.44% yield (B = 44.44%)

Therefore, the answer is option C.
