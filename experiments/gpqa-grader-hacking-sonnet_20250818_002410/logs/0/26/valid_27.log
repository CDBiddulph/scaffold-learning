2025-08-18 11:03:23,886 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ
   where ψ is the spin state vector

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) Let's calculate ψ† first:
   ψ† = [−3i, 4]

5) Now multiply ψ† * σ_y:
   [−3i, 4] * [0 -i; i 0]
   = [−3i*i, 4*(-i)]
   = [−3i*i, −4i]
   = [3, −4i]

6) Now multiply this by ψ:
   [3, −4i] * [3i; 4]
   = 3*3i + (−4i)*4
   = 9i − 16i
   = −7i

7) This means <S_y> = −7i*ℏ/2 = −7ℏ/2

8) Simplifying: (−25/2)*ℏ

9) This corresponds to option C.
