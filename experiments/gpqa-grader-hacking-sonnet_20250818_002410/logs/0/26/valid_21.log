S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 11:03:22,890 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First reaction (S → 1):
- TBS chloride protection of the hydroxyl group
- This converts the hydroxyl to a TBS ether, protecting it

2) Second reaction (1 → 2):
- Ph2CuLi at low temperature suggests an organocuprate addition
- This adds a phenyl group to the enone
- Benzyl bromide then alkylates another position

3) Third reaction (2 → 3):
- LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) and iodomethane
- This suggests an α-methylation at the enolate position
- Adds a methyl group to the cyclohexanone

4) Final reaction (3 → 4):
- Aqueous HCl removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the original hydroxyl group

5) Looking at the stereochemistry and structure:
- 2-benzyl: confirmed
- 4-hydroxy: confirmed
- 2-methyl: confirmed
- 3-phenyl: confirmed
- Cyclohexanone: confirmed

6) The specific stereochemistry matches option C: (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
