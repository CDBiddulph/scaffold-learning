A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:03:23,821 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the conditions:
   - The wave function is time-independent
   - It's spherically symmetric
   - The imaginary part is zero

2) We're told about probabilities:
   - Probability between d1 and 2*d1 is P
   - Probability between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P

3) The probability is proportional to |ψ(r)|^2, where ψ(r) is the wave function

4) The condition that probability is equal for both ranges implies that the probability density is inversely proportional to the volume of the spherical shell

5) The volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr

6) So if the probability is constant (P) for both ranges, the wave function must be proportional to 1/r^2

7) This means the wave function should have the form ψ(r) ∝ 1/r

8) This ensures that |ψ(r)|^2 ∝ 1/r^2, which keeps probability constant across different radial shells

9) The form 1/r satisfies the requirement of the wave function

Therefore, the wave function should have the form 1/r.
