Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:23,750 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what determines the para-substitution in electrophilic aromatic substitution:
- Substituents can be electron-donating (activating) or electron-withdrawing (deactivating)
- Electron-donating groups increase para substitution
- Electron-withdrawing groups decrease para substitution

2) Let's analyze each substituent:
- C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Strongly electron-donating, high para preference
- C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weakly electron-withdrawing
- C6H5-Cl (chloro): Weakly electron-withdrawing
- C6H5-NO2 (nitro): Strongly electron-withdrawing, low para preference
- C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl): Electron-donating
- C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid): Moderately electron-withdrawing

3) Ranking from lowest to highest para-isomer weight fraction:
- NO2 (4) will have the lowest para substitution
- COOH (6) next
- COOC2H5 (2) next
- Cl (3) next
- CH3 (1) will have high para substitution
- C2H5 (5) will have the highest para substitution

4) This matches option C: 4<2<6<3<1<5
