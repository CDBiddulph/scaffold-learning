A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:43,773 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the problem:
- The student is doing a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300°C
- Current conversion rate is not satisfactory
- He needs to increase conversion without losing selectivity

2. Consider temperature effects:
- High temperature (300°C) suggests the reaction might benefit from temperature reduction
- Lowering temperature can:
   a) Improve catalyst efficiency
   b) Potentially increase reaction conversion
   c) Reduce potential side reactions

3. Catalyst considerations:
- Student already tried increasing catalyst amount without success
- This suggests the problem might not be catalyst quantity but reaction conditions

4. Warning about polymerization:
- Hydrocarbon reactions at high temperatures can lead to unwanted polymerization
- Temperature reduction can help mitigate this risk

5. Analyzing the options:
- Option A: Defeatist approach, not recommended
- Option B: Lacks awareness of polymerization risk
- Option C: Scientifically sound approach
   - Decreases temperature
   - Increases catalyst amount
   - Warns about potential polymerization
- Option D: Contradicts good reaction management

6. Conclusion:
The best approach is option C, which methodically addresses conversion improvement while being cautious about potential side reactions.
