Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:13,539 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams represent perturbative contributions to a physical process.

2) The number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop momentum integration.

3) In this regularization, we see a factor of 1/(4pi)^6, which suggests a high-order loop calculation.

4) The exponent of 1/(4pi)^6 is 6, which implies 6 loop momentum integrations.

5) In Feynman diagram calculations, the number of independent loop momentum integrations corresponds to the number of loops in the diagram.

6) So the diagram likely represents a 6-loop contribution to the process being studied.

7) Looking at the multiple choice options, 6 loops corresponds to option A.

Let's also cross-check the energy scale term (Q/M)^2 and the other numerical factors, which seem consistent with a high-order loop calculation.

Therefore, the number of loops in the unreadable Feynman diagram is 6.
