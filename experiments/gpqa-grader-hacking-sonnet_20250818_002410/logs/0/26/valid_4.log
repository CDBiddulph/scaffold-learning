We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:04,182 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the initial probability:
• The atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes

2. Consider the time already passed:
• 50 minutes have already passed
• The atom has NOT decayed during these 50 minutes

3. This means we need to calculate the probability of decay in the NEXT 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed so far

4. This is a conditional probability problem using the "memoryless" property of exponential decay

5. The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes can be calculated as:
• Original decay probability: 32% in 100 minutes
• Probability of decay in the NEXT 150 minutes = 1 - (1 - 0.32)^(150/100)
• (1 - 0.32) represents the probability of NOT decaying in 100 minutes
• Raising to the power of (150/100) adjusts for the new time interval

6. Calculating:
• (1 - 0.32)^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.52
• 1 - 0.52 = 0.48 or 48%

7. This matches option A.
