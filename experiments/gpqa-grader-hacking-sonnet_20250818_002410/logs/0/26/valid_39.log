ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 11:03:34,135 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand what's happening:
- ChIP-seq was done with PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation
- When PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation was used, peaks disappeared
- This suggests a difference in how proteins are crosslinked and preserved

2. Consider the likely cause of peak disappearance:
- DSG is a longer crosslinker that connects proteins with more distance
- This might disrupt protein-DNA interactions at certain genomic locations

3. Analyze the most likely locations for disrupted interactions:
- Random locations are unlikely to have systematic peak loss
- Repeats are generally less regulated
- Introns are less likely sites of active transcription factor binding

4. Focus on active promoters and enhancers:
- These are dynamic regions with complex protein interactions
- Transcription factors like IKAROS often bind here
- Longer crosslinking might more easily disrupt looser, transient interactions
- The crosslinking method could differentially preserve interactions

5. Conclusion:
- Active promoters and enhancers are most likely where peaks would disappear with different fixation methods
