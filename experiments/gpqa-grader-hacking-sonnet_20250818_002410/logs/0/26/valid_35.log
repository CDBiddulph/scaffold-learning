Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:33,673 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C analysis:
- Detected a significant interaction between two genomic regions (5kb bins)
- Active promoter and active enhancer
- Linear distance of ~1 Mb (1 million base pairs)
- Statistically significant interaction signal based on 50M cells

2. FISH validation:
- Could not confirm the Hi-C interaction
- This suggests a potential inconsistency

3. Additional information:
- Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional relationship between the enhancer and promoter

4. Analyzing the possible reasons for inconsistency:
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH detection - LIKELY
   - Hi-C is a population-level technique with high sensitivity
   - FISH is a single-cell technique and might miss low-frequency interactions
   - The 20% expression reduction suggests a real, but potentially weak interaction

B) Structural variation - Less likely
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH - Unlikely (1 Mb is typically detectable)
D) Hi-C false positive - Less likely given the functional validation by dCas9-KRAB experiment

5. Conclusion: The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH.
