Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:03:04,126 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the characteristics of Caesium-137 (Cs-137)
• Cs-137 is a radioactive isotope
• It undergoes beta decay and emits gamma rays
• Half-life is about 30 years
• Each atom decays and emits gamma rays at a specific rate

2. Calculate total number of decays per minute
• 10^17 atoms present
• Decay rate is approximately 3.2 × 10^6 decays per minute per gram
• Assuming 1 decay produces 1 gamma ray

3. Consider detector characteristics
• Detector size: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance from source: 4 meters
• Detector's solid angle will capture only a fraction of emitted gamma rays

4. Estimate gamma ray detection
• Solid angle calculation reduces detection to roughly 1/1000 of total emissions
• Total gamma rays in 80 minutes: (3.2 × 10^6) × 80 ≈ 2.5 × 10^8
• Detected gamma rays: about 10^6 to 10^8

5. Comparing with answer choices, this aligns with option B: 100 million (10^8)
