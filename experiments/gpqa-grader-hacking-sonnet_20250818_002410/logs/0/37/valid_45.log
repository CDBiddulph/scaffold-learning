In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:12:35,653 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the initial gas mixture:
• Total initial volume: A + B + C
• Volume ratio (A+B) : C = 1 : 2.25
• Volume ratio A : B = 1 : 1

2. Density informat...
