You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:49:04,923 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's look at the given examples:
• AGG → 115
• TGCTGA → 176

2. I notice a pattern isn't immediately obvious by just looking at the string lengths or just counting letters.

3. I'll start by analyzing the letters and their positions:
• AGG has 3 letters
• TGCTGA has 6 letters
• ACAGTGACC has 8 letters

4. Let me try to detect a systematic rule by looking at letter composition:
• These seem to have combinations of A, C, G, T
• They look like DNA/RNA sequence fr...
