A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 10:49:12,876 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the principles of relativistic velocity transformation:
- When a medium moves relative to an observer, the velocity of light changes
- The velocity transformation depends on both the refractive index and the medium's velocity

2) We are given:
- Speed of light in vacuum c = 1
- Refractive index of glass = n
- Velocity of glass = v (toward the observer)

3) The relativistic velocity transformation formula in this scenario is:
u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u...
