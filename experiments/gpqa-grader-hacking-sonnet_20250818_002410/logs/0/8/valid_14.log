Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:45,416 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the key parameters:
• Total number of particles = 13
• Each particle has charge 2e
• 12 particles are 2 m from point P
• 13th particle is at point P itself
• We're looking for minimum system energy

2) Calculate the charge magnitude:
• Elementary charge (e) = 1.6 × 10^-19 C
• Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) Calculate electric potential energy:
• Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
• Energy betw...
