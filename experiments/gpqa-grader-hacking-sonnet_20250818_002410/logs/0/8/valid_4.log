We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:34,942 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   - The decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
   - 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   - We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a problem of exponential decay, where the probability depends on the total time elapsed

3) Let's calculate the probability of decay after 200 minutes (50 + 150)
   - We know the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%
   - This means the ...
