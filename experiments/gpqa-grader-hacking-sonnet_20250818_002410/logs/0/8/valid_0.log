Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

2025-08-18 10:48:34,698 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)):
- This looks like a Cope or Claisen-like rearrangement
- The terminal Ï€ bond will migrate and form a new ring structure
- The product will be 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine

2) Second reaction ((3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat):
- A sigmatropic rearrangement of the diyne
- This will form a cyclobutene with cis/trans stereochemistry
- The product will be (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethy...
