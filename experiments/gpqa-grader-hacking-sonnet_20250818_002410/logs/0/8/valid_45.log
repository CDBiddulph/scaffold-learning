In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:49:14,494 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial conditions:
• Total initial volume of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
• Volume ratio of A:B = 1:1
• Densities of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11

2) Let's break down A, B, and C volumes:
• If total (A+B) volume is 1, then C volume is 2.25
• A volume = 0.5
• B volume = 0.5
• C volume = 2.25

3) Given the density difference and equal volume of A and B, A must be a heavier gas.

4) The reaction produces water and HHal acid, suggesting a hal...
