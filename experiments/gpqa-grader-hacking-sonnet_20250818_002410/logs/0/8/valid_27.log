2025-08-18 10:48:54,558 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the spin state vector, and ψ† is its conjugate transpose

2) The given spin state is ψ = (3i, 4)

3) σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

4) Let's compute ψ† first:
   ψ† = (−3i, 4)

5) Now let's multiply step by step:
   <S_y> = (−3i, 4) \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} (3i, 4)ᵀ

6) First, matrix multiplication:
   (−3i, 4) \begin{pmatrix} 0 ...
