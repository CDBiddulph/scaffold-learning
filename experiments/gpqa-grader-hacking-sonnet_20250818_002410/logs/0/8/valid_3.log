2025-08-18 10:48:35,045 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume (ρ = M/V)

2. For option a):
- Same mass and radius as Earth
- Will have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3. For option b):
- 2 Earth masses
- Density stated as approximately 5.5 g/cm³
- This implies a planet with standard rocky composition

4. For option c):
- Same composition as Earth
- 5 times more massive
- To maintain the same composition, it must also have 5 times the volume
- Density will remain cons...
