bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:49:13,157 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one has a ketone group

2) UV irradiation suggests a photochemical reaction. With a ketone, this could cause a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition, forming a cyclobutane ring while maintaining the same molecular weight.

3) The reaction with H2 and Pd/C suggests a catalytic hydrogenation of product 1

4) Catalytic hydrogenation of a cyclobutanone would reduce the ketone to an alcohol

5) In the resulting structure, the hydroxyl hydrog...
