2025-08-18 10:49:13,002 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the relationship between light energy and color:
- Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
- Different colors correspond to different energy ranges of visible light

2. Convert the given energy from electron volts (eV) to wavelength:
- E = hc/λ
- h (Planck's constant) = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s
- c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
- E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 × (1.602 × 10^-19) J = 3.75 × 10^-19 J

3. Calculate wavelength:
- λ = hc/E
- λ = (6....
