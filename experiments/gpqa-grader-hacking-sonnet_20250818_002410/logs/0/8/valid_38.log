2025-08-18 10:49:04,374 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement that involves the migration of terminal groups in a molecule with conjugated double bonds.

2) In this case, we have a molecule with a vinyl group and a nitrogen-containing bicyclic structure.

3) During the Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group will migrate across the double bond, changing the structure of the molecule.

4) The key is to track how the double bonds and the substituents will rearrange:
   - T...
