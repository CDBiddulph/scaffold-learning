2025-08-18 10:48:43,368 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which seeks to extend the Standard Model while respecting fundamental symmetries.

2. Let's analyze each symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
- Describes how physical laws look the same in different inertial reference frames
- MUST be respected by all SMEFT operators
- DEFINITELY included

Poincar√© Symmetry:
- Combines Lorentz symmetry with spacetime translation...
