2025-08-18 10:48:34,745 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equation for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5 × 10¹⁰, which means:
   KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) We know the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates

5) Substituting into the stability constant equation:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

6) Since KCa-EDTA is very large, we can assume x is v...
