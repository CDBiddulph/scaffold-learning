Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:49:04,538 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this carefully:

1. Initial observations:
- Hi-C analysis (50M cells) shows a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- This interaction spans ~1 Mb linear distance
- FISH could not validate the interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. FISH vs Hi-C considerations:
- FISH is a single-cell technique with lower resolution
- Hi-C uses population-level data and computational methods
- The 20% expression reduction suggests a re...
