Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:49:04,254 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the forces at play:
• The particles have point charges
• They experience both an attractive and a repulsive force
• They are separated by 137 meters

2) The forces will likely be electromagnetic forces following fundamental physical principles

3) Key insight: The distance of 137 is suspiciously specific. This might relate to a fundamental physical constant or relationship.

4) In electromagnetic interactions, forces typically follow an ...
