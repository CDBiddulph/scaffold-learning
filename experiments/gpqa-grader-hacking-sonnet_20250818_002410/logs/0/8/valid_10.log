9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:42,765 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting materials:
- 9-fluorenone
- 2 equivalents of selectfluor
- Reaction conditions: acetonitrile solution, 400nm light irradiation

2. Analyze the 19F NMR signals:
- Signal at +29.8 ppm
- Signal at -115.7 ppm
- This suggests two different fluorine environments in the molecule

3. Selectfluor is known to facilitate fluorination reactions, often at activated positions

4. In 9-fluorenone, the most reactive positions for fluorination are typically at the 2 an...
