2025-08-18 10:48:37,670 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum scattering theory, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the partial wave phase shifts.

2) The formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑(2l+1)sin(2δl)

3) k is the wave number, which can be calculated from the electron energy:
   k = √(2m*E)/ℏ
   For 50 MeV electrons, this works out to be approximately 1 fm^-1

4) The summation is over the given phase shifts:
   l = 0:...
