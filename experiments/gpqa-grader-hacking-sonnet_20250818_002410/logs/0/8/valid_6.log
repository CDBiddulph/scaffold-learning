trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D) 11

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:34,741 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. trans-cinnamaldehyde structure:
• This is a 9-carbon molecule with a -CHO group at the end
• Structure looks like: CH3-CH=CH-C6H5-CHO

2. Treatment with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reaction):
• Adds a methyl group to the aldehyde
• Product 1 is now a 10-carbon alcohol
• Structure: CH3-CH=CH-C6H5-CH(OH)-CH3

3. Treatment with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC):
• This oxidizes the alcohol back to a ketone
• Product 2 is now a 10-carbon ketone
• Structure: CH3...
