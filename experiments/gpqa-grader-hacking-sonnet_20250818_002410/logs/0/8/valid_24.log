Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:53,594 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance each particle travels in 1e-5s:
• Distance = Speed × Time
• Speed is given as a fraction of light speed (c)
• c ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s

2) Calculating distances:
• Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 × 3×10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,880m
• Eta (0.9c): 0.9 × 3×10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,700m
• Chi (0.88c): 0.88 × 3×10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,640m
• Lambda (0.93c): 0.93 × 3×10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,790m

3) Comparing distances to ground level (13,000m):
• Zeta: 13,000m - 2,880m = 10,120m (w...
