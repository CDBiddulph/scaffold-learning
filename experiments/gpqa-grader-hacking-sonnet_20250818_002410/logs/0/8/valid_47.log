For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:49:14,063 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the context
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM) are extensions of the Standard Model with multiple Higgs doublets
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) quantify potential quantum corrections in electroweak precision tests
- Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance effects in particle interactions

2. Theoretical considerations
- Breit-Wigner corrections can capture additional quantum effects not included in original Oblique Parameters
- The...
