2025-08-18 10:48:54,096 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relation between angular size θ, radius R, and distance d:
   θ (radians) = R/d

2) We know:
   d = 10^10 parsecs
   θ = 10^-17 degrees = (10^-17 * π/180) radians

3) Rearrange to find the radius R:
   R = θ * d
   R = (10^-17 * π/180) * (10^10 parsecs)
   R ≈ 10^-7 parsecs

4) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   R ≈ 10^-7 * (3 * 10^16) = 3 * 10^9 meters

5) For black holes, the entropy is proportional to the surface a...
