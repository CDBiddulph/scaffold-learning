You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 10:49:12,599 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) of the expression vector:
- Contains HindIII, KpnI, and BamHI sites
- We want to clone the sequence directionally

2. Analyze the primer requirements:
- Need restriction enzyme sites to match the MCS
- Sites should enable directional cloning
- One primer at start (5' end), one at end (3' end)

3. Examining the specific sequences:
- Start codon ATG is at the beginning of the sequence
- Primers will need to add...
