Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:43,594 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the complexity and dimensionality of a Feynman diagram can be determined by counting the number of independent loop integrations.

2) The energy scale dependence of loop diagrams follows a predictable pattern in powers of the coupling constant and loop count.

3) The diagram contains a symbolic representation involving alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

4) The key clue is the denominator 1/(4pi)^6, which suggests the pow...
