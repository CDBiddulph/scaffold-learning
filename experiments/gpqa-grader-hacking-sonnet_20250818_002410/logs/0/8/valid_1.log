Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:35,767 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the half-life of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
• This means decay is relatively slow

2) Calculate decay rate:
• Total atoms = 10^17
• Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life
• This gives a relatively low decay rate per minute

3) Gamma-ray emission:
• Each decaying atom emits a specific number of gamma rays
• For Cs-137, typically 1-2 gamma rays per decay

4) Detector considerations:
• Detector area: 2 × 3 = 6 cm...
