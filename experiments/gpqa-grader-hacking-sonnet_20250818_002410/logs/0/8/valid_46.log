The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 10:49:12,989 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to surface temperature:
   • Peak energy ∝ Temperature
   • Star A peak: 7.21 eV
   • Sun's peak: 1.41 eV

2) Temperature ratio:
   7.21 eV / 1.41 eV = 5.11

3) Luminosity is related to radius and temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   L ∝ R²T⁴
   • Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun
   • Let R be the radius of star A relative to the sun's radius

4) Rearrange luminosity equation:
