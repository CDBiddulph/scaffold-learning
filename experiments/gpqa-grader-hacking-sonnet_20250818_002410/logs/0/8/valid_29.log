Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:48:54,151 [INFO] LLM response (first 500 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically active requirements:
- Must contain a single chirality center
- Requires an asymmetric carbon atom
- Should have 4 different substituents

2. Elemental composition analysis:
- All have similar C:H ratios
- Suggests saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes/cycloalkanes)

3. Mass spectrometry (EI-MS) fragment analysis:
A) C5H12 (pentane) - symmetric, not optically active
B) C6H14 (hexane) - symmetric, not optically active
C) C4H10 (butane) - symmetric, not optic...
