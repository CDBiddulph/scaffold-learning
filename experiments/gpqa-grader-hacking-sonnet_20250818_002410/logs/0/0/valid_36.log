Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
