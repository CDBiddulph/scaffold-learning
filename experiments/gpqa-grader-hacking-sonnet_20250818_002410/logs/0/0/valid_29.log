Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Optically active compounds require the following conditions:
- Must have a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- Chiral center requires 4 different substituents
- Impl...
