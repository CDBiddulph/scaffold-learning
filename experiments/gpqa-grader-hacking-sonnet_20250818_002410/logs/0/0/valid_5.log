Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

2025-08-18 10:42:15,127 [INFO] Got LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts by the optical theorem:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * Σ(2l+1)sin(2δl)
