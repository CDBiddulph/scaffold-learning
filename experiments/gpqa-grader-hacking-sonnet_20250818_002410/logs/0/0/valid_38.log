Identify the possible product when (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene undergoes Cope rearrangement.

A) 4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
B) 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
C) 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
D) 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
