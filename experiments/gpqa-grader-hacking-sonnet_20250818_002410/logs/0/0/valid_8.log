What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:42:13,478 [INFO] Got LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, let's understand the equilibrium reaction:
• Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻
• Kf (formation constant) = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA] = 5 × 10¹⁰

2. Initial concentrati...
