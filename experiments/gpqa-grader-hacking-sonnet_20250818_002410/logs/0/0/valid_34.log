You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:42:42,423 [INFO] Got LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the pattern
• We have two known inputs and outputs:
   AGG → 115
   TGCTGA → 176

2. Let's count the letters in each input
• AGG: 3 letters
•...

=== OUTPUT ===
D

=== EXECUTION TIME ===
6.255 seconds
