9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
