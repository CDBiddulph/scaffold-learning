There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:15:57,491 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key properties of a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate:
   - The first qubit is the control qubit
   - The second qubit is the target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In the input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩:
   - The first part (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) is the first qubit
   - |0⟩ is the second qubit (target)

3) The control condition is that the first qubit must be in |0⟩ state
   - In this input, the first coefficient is α corresponding to |0⟩

4) When the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged

5) However, the output must now reflect this, so the target qubit will be flipped

6) Analyzing the options carefully, option C matches this transformation:
   α|0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ + (β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

7) This matches the scientific principles of quantum computation for a C-NOT gate with a |0⟩ control qubit
