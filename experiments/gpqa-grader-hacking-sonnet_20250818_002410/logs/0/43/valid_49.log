bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-18 11:16:39,507 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one structure:
- A rigid, cage-like bicyclic ketone structure
- UV irradiation suggests a photochemical reaction

2) UV irradiation (first step):
- The ketone likely undergoes a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition
- This forms a cyclobutane ring, maintaining the same molecular weight
- Product 1 is a cyclobutane derivative of the original ketone

3) Hydrogenation with Pd/C (second step):
- Converts unsaturated rings to saturated rings
- Reduces double bonds to single bonds
- Product 2 is a fully saturated bicyclic ketone

4) NMR splitting pattern considerations:
- The most deshielded hydrogen will be near the ketone group
- The hydrogenation would create new neighboring hydrogen environments
- A triplet suggests two equivalent neighboring hydrogens

5) Analysis points to a triplet splitting pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen

Reasoning strongly supports option C.
