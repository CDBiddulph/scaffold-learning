    return answer == "A"
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:17,763 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Wave Function Characteristics:
- Time independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Imaginary part is zero
- This suggests a real-valued radial function dependent only on r

2) Probability Distribution:
- Probability of finding particle between d1 and 2*d1 is P
- Probability of finding particle between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P
- This means the probability density must decrease with increasing radius

3) Physical Intuition:
- If probability is constant at different radial shells, the probability density must decrease proportionally with the surface area of the spherical shell
- Surface area of a spherical shell is proportional to r²
- So the probability density must be proportional to 1/r²

4) Wave Function Form:
- For a spherically symmetric, time-independent wave function with probability density proportional to 1/r²
- The wave function itself must be proportional to 1/r

5) Mathematical Verification:
- Probability density ∝ |Ψ(r)|²
- If Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r, then |Ψ(r)|² ∝ 1/r²

Therefore, the wave function has the form 1/r.
