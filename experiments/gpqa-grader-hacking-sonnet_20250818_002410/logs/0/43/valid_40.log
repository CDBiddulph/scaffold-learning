A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 11:16:39,388 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) This problem involves relativistic light propagation in a moving medium, requiring careful consideration of the relativistic velocity addition formula.

2) The key variables are:
   - Speed of light in vacuum (c) = 1
   - Refractive index of glass (n)
   - Velocity of glass (v)

3) The relativistic velocity addition formula for light in a moving medium is:
   u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/cÂ²)
   where u is the speed of light in the medium at rest, and u' is the observed speed

4) In our case:
   u = 1/n (speed of light in the stationary glass)
   c = 1

5) Substituting into the velocity addition formula:
   u' = (1/n - v) / (1 - (1/n)v)

6) After algebraic manipulation, this reduces to:
   u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) Comparing this to the given options, this matches option D exactly.

Answer: D

The solution relies on the relativistic velocity addition formula, accounting for both the medium's refractive properties and its motion relative to the observer.
