Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:08,092 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the molecular formulas and NMR data
- A (C6H13Br): Has a bromine atom, likely 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane
- B (C4H6): Unsaturated hydrocarbon, appears to be but-1-yne
- C (C10H18): Product with 5 signals suggesting a complex structure

2. Reaction mechanism considerations
- The presence of a bromine compound (A) and an alkyne (B) suggests a nucleophilic substitution
- But-1-yne is a terminal alkyne with a nucleophilic acetylide ion potential
- The NMR data supports a substitution mechanism

3. Structural analysis
- Combining C6H13Br and C4H6 would create a C10H18 molecule
- The product "7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne" matches this composition
- The singlet in the product NMR suggests symmetrical dimethyl groups

4. Reaction details
- Nucleophilic substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
- Acetylide ion displaces bromide
- Forms 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne

5. Matching the description in the options

The description in option B precisely matches our analysis.
