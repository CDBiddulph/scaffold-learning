Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:18,142 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using relativistic physics and time dilation calculations:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s:

Distance = Speed * Time
- Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 28800m
- Eta (0.9c): 0.9 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 27000m
- Chi (0.88c): 0.88 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 26400m
- Lambda (0.93c): 0.93 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 27900m

2. Compare these distances to the ground level height (13000m):

- Chi: 26400m < 13000m, will reach ground
- Eta: 27000m > 13000m, will reach ground
- Lambda: 27900m > 13000m, will reach ground
- Zeta: 28800m > 13000m, will reach ground

3. Ranking by number of particles reaching ground:
- Zeta: 30000 particles
- Lambda: 24000 particles
- Eta: 20000 particles
- Chi: 19000 particles

4. Ordering from most to least:
Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi

The answer that matches this order is B.
