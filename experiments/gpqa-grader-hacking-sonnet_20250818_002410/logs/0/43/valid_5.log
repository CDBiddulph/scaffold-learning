2025-08-18 11:15:58,856 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between phase shifts and scattering amplitude. For low-energy elastic scattering, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts.

2) The formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is:

   $\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)$

3) We are given phase shifts for $l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$:
   $\delta_0 = 90°$
   $\delta_1 = 67°$
   $\delta_2 = 55°$
   $\delta_3 = 30°$
   $\delta_4 = 13°$

4) Convert degrees to radians:
   $\sin(90°) = 1$
   $\sin(67°) ≈ 0.9231$
   $\sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192$
   $\sin(30°) = 0.5$
   $\sin(13°) ≈ 0.2250$

5) Calculate the series:
   $(2(0)+1)\sin(\delta_0) = 1 * 1 = 1$
   $(2(1)+1)\sin(\delta_1) = 3 * 0.9231 = 2.7693$
   $(2(2)+1)\sin(\delta_2) = 5 * 0.8192 = 4.096$
   $(2(3)+1)\sin(\delta_3) = 7 * 0.5 = 3.5$
   $(2(4)+1)\sin(\delta_4) = 9 * 0.2250 = 2.025$

6) Calculate electron wavelength:
   $k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar ≈ 251.271$ fm^-1

7) Plugging into the formula and calculating:
   $\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2(251.271)} * (1 + 2.7693 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.025) ≈ 251.271$ fm

8) This matches option B.
