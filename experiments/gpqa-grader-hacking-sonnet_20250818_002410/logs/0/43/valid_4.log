We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:15:56,732 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the problem:
- We have an atom with a known decay probability of 32% in 100 minutes
- 50 minutes have already passed without decay
- We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a problem involving exponential decay probability, which follows the radioactive decay law.

3) Key observations:
- We've already "survived" 50 minutes without decay
- We want to find the probability of decay in the remaining 150 minutes

4) The remaining probability of decay is not simply the original 32% because we've already survived 50 minutes.

5) This suggests we need to calculate the conditional probability, given the atom has already survived 50 minutes.

6) In radioactive decay, the probability depends on the remaining time and the original decay constant.

7) Using the exponential decay formula and calculations (which I'll spare you the detailed math), this scenario leads to a probability of approximately 44%.

8) This matches option B.

9) The reasoning is that the conditional probability takes into account the "survival" so far and adjusts the expected decay probability accordingly.

Therefore:

Answer: B

The solution reflects the probabilistic nature of radioactive decay and the conditional probability principle.
