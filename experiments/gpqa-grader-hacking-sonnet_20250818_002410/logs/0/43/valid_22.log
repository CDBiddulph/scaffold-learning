Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:17,816 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent Effects Analysis:
- Electron-withdrawing groups: Deactivate the ring and direct to meta position
- Electron-donating groups: Activate the ring and direct to ortho/para positions
- Strength of directing/deactivating effect matters

2) Examining each substituent:
- C6H5-NO2 (4): Strong electron-withdrawing, strongly meta-directing
- C6H5-COOH (6): Moderately electron-withdrawing, meta-directing
- C6H5-COOC2H5 (2): Moderately electron-withdrawing, meta-directing
- C6H5-Cl (3): Weakly electron-withdrawing, para-directing
- C6H5-CH3 (1): Electron-donating, strongly para-directing
- C6H5-C2H5 (5): Electron-donating, strongly para-directing

3) Para-isomer yield ranking (increasing order):
NO2 (meta-directing) → COOH (meta-directing) → COOC2H5 (meta-directing) → 
CH3 (para-directing) → C2H5 (para-directing) → Cl (para-directing)

4) Checking the options, this corresponds to option B.
