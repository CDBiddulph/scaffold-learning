Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:18,602 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The passage describes the Wnt3a signaling pathway, focusing on key molecular components and processes.

2. Option A contains some correct terms:
   - "Translocation into nucleus" ✓ (mentioned in the passage)
   - "Intracellular calcium" ✓ (mentioned as a regulated process)
   - "Destruction complex" ✓ (mentioned in context of Beta-catenin)
   - "Frizzled" ✓ (mentioned as the receptor)

3. Option B contains:
   - "Proteasomal degradation" ✓ (correctly describes Beta-catenin's fate)
   - "N-terminal extracellular" ✓ (describes receptor domain)
   - "Frizzled" ✓
   - "Non-canonical" ✓ (mentioned in the passage)

4. Option C contains:
   - "Beta-catenin" ✓
   - "Directly binds DNA" ✓
   - "LRP5/6" ✓
   - "Transmembrane receptor protein" ✓

5. Option D contains:
   - "Transcriptional co-activator" ✓ (describes Beta-catenin's nuclear function)
   - "Glycoprotein" ✓ (describes Wnt3a)
   - "Accumulation in cytoplasm" ✓ (describes Beta-catenin)
   - "Beta-catenin" ✓

6. All options have correct terms, but the question asks for the group with ONLY correct terms.

7. Careful review shows Option D contains exclusively correct terms from the passage.
