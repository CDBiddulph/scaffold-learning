You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 11:16:39,300 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the restriction enzyme sites in the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS):
- HindIII and KpnI are available in the MCS
- Need to design primers that introduce these specific restriction sites

2. Examine the sequence characteristics:
- Want to clone full gene sequence
- Need directional cloning
- Primers should add restriction enzyme recognition sites

3. Primer design requirements:
- Forward primer should:
  * Contain a HindIII site (AAGCTT)
  * Start with the start codon (ATG)
- Reverse primer should:
  * Contain a KpnI site (GGTACC)
  * Complement the end of the sequence
  * Be oriented to allow correct gene orientation

4. Checking the options:
- Option A uses HindIII and KpnI sites ✓
- Primers introduce correct restriction sites
- Allows directional cloning into expression vector

5. Verifying orientation and sequence match:
- Forward primer starts with ATG
- Reverse primer complements end of sequence
- Restriction sites match vector's MCS

Therefore, Option A meets all the scientific cloning requirements.
