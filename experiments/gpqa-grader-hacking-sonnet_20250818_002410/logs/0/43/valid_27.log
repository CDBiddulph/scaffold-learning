2025-08-18 11:16:17,386 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the spin expectation value calculation:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) Given spin state ψ = (3i, 4)
   ψ† = (3i*, 4*)

3) σ_y matrix:
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}

4) Calculation:
   <S_y> = (3i*, 4*) · \begin{pmatrix}0 & -i \\ i & 0\end{pmatrix} · (3i, 4)

5) Step-by-step matrix multiplication:
   • First row: (3i*)·(i)·4 + (3i*)·(0)·3i
   • Second row: (4*)·(0)·4 + (4*)·(-i)·3i

6) Simplified calculation:
   <S_y> = (3i*)·(i)·4
          = -3 · 4
          = -12*ℏ/25

7) This matches option D: -12*ℏ/25
