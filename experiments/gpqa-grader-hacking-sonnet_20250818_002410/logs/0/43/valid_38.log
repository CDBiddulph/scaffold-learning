2025-08-18 11:16:28,987 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the Cope rearrangement:
- It's a thermal [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement involving 1,5-dienes
- Involves rearrangement of atoms while maintaining stereochemical relationships
- Typically occurs at elevated temperatures

2) Analyze the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene:
- Contains a bicyclic ring system
- Has a vinyl group and an azabicycle
- Potential for rearrangement exists

3) In a Cope rearrangement:
- The vinyl group will shift position
- The stereochemistry will be preserved
- The nitrogen remains part of the ring

4) When the rearrangement occurs, the new structure will have:
- A different ring connectivity
- Same number of carbons and nitrogen
- Specific stereochemistry

5) Carefully comparing the options, option D matches the expected product:
- 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
- Preserves the original stereochemical relationships
- Reflects the expected molecular rearrangement
