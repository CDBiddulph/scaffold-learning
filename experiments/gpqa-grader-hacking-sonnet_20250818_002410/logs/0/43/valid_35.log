Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:29,138 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Hi-C Results:
- Detected a significant interaction between promoter and enhancer
- Bins are 5kb in size
- Linear distance between interacting regions is ~1 Mb (1 million base pairs)
- 50 million cells were used in the analysis

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not validate the Hi-C interaction
- This suggests potential discrepancy in detection methods

3. Additional Evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional relationship between the two regions

4. Analyzing Potential Reasons:
A) Low interaction frequency - Plausible, as FISH has lower sensitivity than Hi-C
B) Structural variation - Possible, but no direct evidence provided
C) Interaction too short - Unlikely, as 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH
D) Hi-C false positive - Less likely given the functional validation

5. Key Considerations:
- Hi-C can detect rare interactions across large populations
- FISH looks at individual cell interactions
- 20% expression reduction suggests a real, but potentially weak interaction

6. Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH, but still significant enough to impact gene expression.
