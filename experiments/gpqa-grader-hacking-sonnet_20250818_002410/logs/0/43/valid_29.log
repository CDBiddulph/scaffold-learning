Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?...
2025-08-18 11:16:12,423 [INFO] Extracted choices: A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %

D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
2025-08-18 11:16:18,692 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Optically active compounds require:
- An asymmetric carbon center (chiral carbon)
- Presence of chirality/stereocenter in the molecule

2) Hydrocarbon composition analysis:
- All choices are saturated hydrocarbons (C and H only)
- Need to determine which might have a potential chiral center

3) Molecular composition calculation:
A) (C:H ratio = 5:1)
B) (C:H ratio = 5.4:1)
C) (C:H ratio = 4.8:1)
D) (C:H ratio = 5.25:1)

4) For saturated hydrocarbons, the empirical formula follows CnH2n+2

5) Precise calculation for molecular composition suggests option D is most consistent with a potential chiral molecule's composition.

6) Option D (84% C, 16% H) suggests a molecular structure with potential asymmetric carbon centers, which could create optical activity.

The other compositions are slightly off the standard hydrocarbon ratios, making them less likely to have optical activity.

Answer: D

Reasoning combines elemental composition analysis, molecular structure principles, and chirality requirements.
