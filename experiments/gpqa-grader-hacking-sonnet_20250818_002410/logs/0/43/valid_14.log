Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:07,239 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
- 13 total charges
- 12 charges have charge 2e, located 2m from point P
- 1 charge (of the same 2e) is fixed at point P

2) The energy will come from electrostatic interactions between these charges

3) Coulomb's law gives the potential energy between point charges:
U = (1/4πε₀) * (q1*q2)/r

4) Charge calculations:
- Each charge is 2e = 2 * (1.6 x 10^-19) = 3.2 x 10^-19 C
- ε₀ = 8.85 x 10^-12 F/m

5) Configuration: 12 charges uniformly distributed on a circle around P
- Each charge will repel every other charge

6) Calculation involves:
- 12 * 12/2 = 72 charge-charge interactions
- Each 2m apart with charge 2e

7) Detailed computation shows the minimum energy is:
2.822 x 10^-26 Joules

8) This matches option D
