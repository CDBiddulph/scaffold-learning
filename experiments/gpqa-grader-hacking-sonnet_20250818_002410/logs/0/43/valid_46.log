The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-18 11:16:39,564 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the principles of stellar radiation and Stefan-Boltzmann law:

1) Peak Wavelength and Temperature Relation:
• Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature
• T ∝ E_peak
• Star A peak: 7.21 eV
• Sun peak: 1.41 eV

2) Temperature Calculation:
• Temperature ratio = (7.21 eV) / (1.41 eV) ≈ 5.11
• Star A is significantly hotter than the sun

3) Luminosity Relation:
• Luminosity L ∝ R²T⁴ (Stefan-Boltzmann law)
• Given: Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

4) Radius Calculation:
• L_A/L_sun = (R_A/R_sun)² * (T_A/T_sun)⁴
• 24 = (R_A/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴
• R_A/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
• R_A/R_sun ≈ 0.19

5) Checking the options, 0.19 corresponds to option B.
