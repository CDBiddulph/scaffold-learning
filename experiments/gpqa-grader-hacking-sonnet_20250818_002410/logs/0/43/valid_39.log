ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:28,961 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this ChIP-seq question step by step:

1. ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing) is a technique used to map protein-DNA interactions genome-wide.

2. The experiment involves:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation
- Antibody targeting IKAROS transcription factor
- Next-generation sequencing
- Peak identification

3. Key observation: Peaks disappear when PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation is used, suggesting specific binding characteristics.

4. IKAROS is a key transcription factor in B cell development and regulation.

5. Considerations for peak location:
- Random locations (A) would not suggest a specific biological mechanism
- Repeats (B) are generally less transcriptionally active
- Introns (C) are less likely for direct transcription factor binding

6. Active promoters and enhancers (D) are:
- High-occupancy regions for transcription factors
- Sites of active transcriptional regulation
- Consistent with IKAROS's known role in gene expression
- More likely to show specific binding patterns

7. The disappearing peaks suggest a specific, physiologically relevant binding pattern most consistent with active regulatory regions.

The scientific reasoning strongly points to active promoters and enhancers.
