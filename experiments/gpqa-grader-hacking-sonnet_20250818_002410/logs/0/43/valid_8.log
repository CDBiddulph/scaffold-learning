2025-08-18 11:15:55,900 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the given information:
- Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
- Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5 × 10^10
- Temperature = 25°C
- Assume ideal pH conditions

2. The stability constant (K) relates to the dissociation of the complex:
Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

3. The equilibrium constant is defined as:
K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4. Rearranging the equation to solve for [Ca²⁺]:
[Ca²⁺] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5. Since the stoichiometric concentrations are equal and K is very large, we can approximate [Ca²⁺]:
[Ca²⁺] = K × 0.02 / 1

6. Calculating:
[Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10^10) × (0.02) = 6.3 × 10^-7 M

7. This matches option B.
