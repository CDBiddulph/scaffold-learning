2025-08-18 11:16:38,966 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key information:
- The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV
- We need to determine the color of light absorbed by the compound

2. Energy and Color Relationship:
- Light color is directly related to its energy/wavelength
- Higher energy = shorter wavelength (blue/violet)
- Lower energy = longer wavelength (red/yellow)

3. Calculating the wavelength:
- Energy (E) = hc/λ
- h (Planck's constant) = 4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s
- c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
- λ = (hc)/E
- λ = [(4.136 × 10^-15)(3 × 10^8)] / 2.3393
- λ ≈ 530 nm (green-yellow region)

4. Complementary Color Analysis:
- If the emission is at 530 nm (green-yellow)
- The absorbed color would be its complementary color
- Complementary to green-yellow is violet-blue

5. Precise Color Determination:
- Among the options, the best match is Violet

Therefore, the answer is B: Violet.
