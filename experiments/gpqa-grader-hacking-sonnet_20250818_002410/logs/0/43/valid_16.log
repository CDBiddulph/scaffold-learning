A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 11:16:08,463 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. Experimental Setup:
- Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA were injected into a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The goal was to introduce a specific genetic modification
- The resulting embryo was carried to full term by a surrogate mother

2. Key Observation:
- Genome sequencing revealed different DNA sequences in cells from different tissues
- This suggests the genetic modification did not uniformly occur in all cells during embryo development

3. Analyzing the Options:

A) Unlikely. cDNA conversion of Cas9 mRNA and random genomic integration would not explain systematic differences across cell lineages.

B) Improbable. Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation doesn't explain the staged, non-uniform modification.

C) Incorrect. There's no mechanism suggested for surrogate mother's DNA entering embryo cells.

D) Most Likely:
- Cas9 is a DNA-cutting enzyme (nuclease)
- Continuous DNA cutting during early embryonic development could lead to:
  1. Stochastic DNA repair mechanisms
  2. Donor DNA integration at different developmental stages
  3. Mosaic genetic modification across cell lineages

4. Scientific Principle:
This phenomenon is known as genomic mosaicism, where different cells in an organism have different genetic compositions due to imprecise gene editing during early embryonic development.
