For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:40,649 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1) Multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM) are extensions of the Standard Model that introduce additional Higgs doublets beyond the single doublet in the original model.

2) Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) were originally introduced by Peskin and Walkter to parametrize potential new physics effects in electroweak precision measurements.

3) Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance line shapes and how particles interact near their mass peaks.

4) In multi-Higgs models, the interactions between Higgs bosons can modify the original Oblique Parameters.

5) However, the fundamental constraints on New Physics from these parameters don't fundamentally change by adding Breit-Wigner corrections.

6) The key physical insight is that the underlying symmetry and interaction structure remains consistent - Breit-Wigner corrections provide refinement, not a dramatically different constraint.

7) The masses of charged scalars do influence the parameters, but not in a way that suggests a major difference in constraining power.

8) The most conservative and technically accurate statement is that there is essentially no significant difference between the original and Breit-Wigner corrected Oblique Parameters.

Reasoning points to option D: No, there is no difference.
