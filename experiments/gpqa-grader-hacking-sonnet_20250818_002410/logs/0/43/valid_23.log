2025-08-18 11:16:19,077 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the magnitude distance relationship:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 * log10(distance/10 parsecs)

2) For the single star at 20 parsecs (option A):
   • Distance modulus = 5 * log10(20/10) = 5 * log10(2) = 5 * 0.3 = 1.5
   • If apparent magnitude is 7, absolute magnitude would be 7 - 1.5 = 5.5

3) For the two-star system with absolute magnitudes 7 and 7 at 10 parsecs (option B):
   • Distance modulus = 5 * log10(10/10) = 0
   • Apparent magnitudes would be 7
   • Combined apparent magnitude: Use magnitude addition formula
   • For equal magnitude stars: m_combined = m_single - 2.5 * log10(2)
   • 7 - 2.5 * log10(2) ≈ 5.75

4) For the two-star system with apparent magnitudes 7 and 8 at 5 parsecs (option C):
   • Distance modulus = 5 * log10(5/10) = -2.5
   • Combined apparent magnitude would be lower than individual magnitudes
   • Approximately 5.2-5.3

5) Comparing the calculated apparent magnitudes:
   A: 7 mag
   B: 5.75 mag
   C: 5.2-5.3 mag
   D: 7 mag

The lowest magnitude number is the brightest object. Therefore, option C is the brightest.
