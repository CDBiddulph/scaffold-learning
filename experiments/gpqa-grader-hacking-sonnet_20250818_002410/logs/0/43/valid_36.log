Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:22,078 [INFO] Extracted choices: A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.
2025-08-18 11:16:28,559 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Context:
- Satellites are detecting astronomical objects from low Earth orbit
- Localization precision is around 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Analyzing Distance Scales:
- Light year is a vast astronomical distance unit
- 1 light year â‰ˆ 9.46 trillion kilometers
- A million light years is an intergalactic scale
- A thousand light years is within our galaxy's scale

3. Evaluating Options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years 
   - This is an extremely large, extragalactic scale
   - Too distant for low Earth orbit detection precision

B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years
   - This range covers most of the Milky Way galaxy
   - Consistent with satellite detection capabilities
   - Matches the described localization precision

C) 10 or 100 light years
   - Too close, within local stellar neighborhood
   - Would not require sophisticated satellite detection

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - These are extremely short distances
   - Within solar system scale
   - Not representative of astronomical object distribution

4. Conclusion:
Option B provides the most scientifically plausible distance range.
