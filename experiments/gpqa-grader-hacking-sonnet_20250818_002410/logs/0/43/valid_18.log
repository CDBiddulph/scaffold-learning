The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:06,638 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Mott-Gurney Equation:
- This equation describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in semiconductor devices
- It relates current density (J) to voltage (V) under specific conditions

2. Key Requirements for Validity:
- Single-carrier device: The equation assumes only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes)
- Trap-free condition: No significant carrier traps that would modify carrier transport
- No carrier injection barrier: Carriers can move freely between electrodes
- Negligible diffusion current: Current is primarily driven by drift mechanism

3. Analyzing the Options:
A) Mentions Ohmic contact - this is NOT consistent with the Mott-Gurney assumptions
B) Matches ALL requirements: no carrier injection barrier, trap-free, single-carrier, negligible diffusion current
C) Mentions Schottky contact - this violates the no-barrier assumption
D) Refers to two-carrier device - Mott-Gurney is specifically for single-carrier scenario

4. Conclusion:
Option B precisely describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.
