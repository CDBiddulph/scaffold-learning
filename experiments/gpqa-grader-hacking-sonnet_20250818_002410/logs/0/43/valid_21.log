S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:17,883 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction: S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDSCl + Et3N
- This protects the hydroxyl group with a silyl ether
- Prevents side reactions in subsequent steps

2) Second reaction: Product 1 + Ph2CuLi (low temp) then benzyl bromide
- Organocopper reagent adds phenyl group
- Followed by alkylation with benzyl bromide
- Creates new carbon-carbon bond

3) Third reaction: Product 2 + LDA + iodomethane
- LDA deprotonates at specific position
- Methyl group added via alkylation
- Introduces a methyl substituent

4) Final reaction: Product 3 + aqueous HCl
- Removes silyl protecting group
- Restores hydroxyl group
- Provides stereochemistry information

Analyzing the stereochemistry and substituents step by step leads to structure D.

The final product has:
- Benzyl group
- Phenyl group
- Hydroxyl group
- Methyl group
- Specific stereochemistry: (2S,3R,4S,6S)

Therefore, the structure matches option D.
