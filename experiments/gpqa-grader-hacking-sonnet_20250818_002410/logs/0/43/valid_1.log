Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:15:56,842 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Radioactive Decay Characteristics:
- Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope
- It decays by emitting beta particles and gamma rays
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years

2. Number of Atoms:
- Total atoms = 10^17
- This is a very large number of radioactive atoms

3. Decay Rate Calculation:
- Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life
- Decay rate will be proportional to number of atoms
- Over 80 minutes (short compared to half-life), decay rate is relatively constant

4. Gamma Ray Emission:
- Not every decay produces a detectable gamma ray
- Typical gamma emission probability is around 1 in 10,000 decays
- 10^17 atoms × (decay probability) × (detection probability)

5. Detector Considerations:
- 2x3 cm detector at 4m distance
- Solid angle of detection will reduce detected gamma rays
- Estimated detection efficiency ≈ 10^-4 to 10^-5

6. Rough Calculation:
- Total gamma rays ≈ 10^17 × (1/10000) × (10^-4) 
- Result is approximately 10^6 gamma rays

This aligns perfectly with option C: 1 million (10^6) gamma rays.
