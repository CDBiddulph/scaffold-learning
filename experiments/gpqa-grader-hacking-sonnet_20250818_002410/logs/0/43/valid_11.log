All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 11:16:09,176 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement carefully:

A) Regarding pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting:
- The statement appears scientifically sound. Pseudoknots play a crucial role in programmed ribosomal frameshifting, and the number of conformations can indeed influence frameshifting rates.
- This statement seems correct based on current molecular biology understanding.

B) About nsp10/nsp14-ExoN:
- This statement contains some inaccuracies:
  - While nsp10 and nsp14 do interact, the mechanism described is not entirely accurate.
  - nsp14 has an exonuclease (ExoN) domain that is important for proofreading and maintaining genome integrity.
  - However, the claim about preventing dsRNA breakdown is not precisely correct.
  - The interaction is more complex and involves RNA repair mechanisms.

C) Regarding ORF3a and apoptosis:
- This statement appears to be a scientifically accurate description of how SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis.
- It correctly describes the mechanism of caspase-8 activation and the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) About programmed ribosomal frameshifting:
- The description of the frameshifting mechanism is generally correct.
- The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV frameshifting conformations seems reasonable.

The question asks which statement is INCORRECT.

The statement that contains the most significant scientific inaccuracies is B.

The description of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN mechanism is oversimplified and contains errors about its function and interaction.

Therefore, B is the statement that is NOT correct.
