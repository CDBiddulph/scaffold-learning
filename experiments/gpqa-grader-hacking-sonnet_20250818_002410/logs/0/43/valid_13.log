2025-08-18 11:16:06,622 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is a framework that extends the Standard Model of particle physics.

2. Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):
- Fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
- Describes invariance of physical laws under coordinate transformations
- ESSENTIAL in SMEFT, so MUST be respected

3. Poincare Symmetry (Option 2):
- Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
- Fundamental to relativistic theories
- Also ESSENTIAL in SMEFT

4. CP Symmetry (Option 3):
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
- Not universally required in SMEFT
- Can be violated in certain interactions

5. CPT Symmetry (Option 4):
- Combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T)
- A fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories
- Typically considered a core principle in SMEFT

Reasoning:
- Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are absolutely mandatory
- CPT symmetry is also considered fundamental
- CP symmetry is not universally required

Therefore, Options 1, 2, and 4 must be respected.
