Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:16:07,126 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this systematically:

1) The key information is the symbolic expression: 
   alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

2) In quantum field theory, loop diagrams are a key component of perturbative calculations. The number of loops is directly related to the power of certain physical parameters.

3) Looking at the regularization and loop estimate, the most critical factor is often the power of coupling constants and loop integration measures.

4) Most loop contributions are characterized by powers of loop momentum and coupling constants.

5) The 1/(4pi)^6 term is particularly suggestive. The power of 6 typically implies 3 loops, as each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2.

6) The (Q/M)^2 suggests momentum scaling consistent with a 3-loop diagram.

7) The combination of numerical factors and power scaling points strongly to a 3-loop diagram.

Reasoning conclusively indicates that the Feynman diagram represents a 3-loop contribution to the quantum field theory calculation.
