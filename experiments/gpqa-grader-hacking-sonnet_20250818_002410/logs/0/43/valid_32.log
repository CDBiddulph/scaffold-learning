We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 11:16:28,677 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial System Analysis:
- We have Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions at equal concentrations (0.01 M each)
- Solution pH is 1.0
- Sulfuric acid is present
- E0 for Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V
- Phosphate ions are added to a concentration of 0.1 M
- H2PO4^- equilibrium concentration is 6.97x10^-3 M

2. Complex Formation:
- The Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex formation constant is extremely high (10^21)
- This suggests significant complex formation will occur

3. Nernst Equation Considerations:
- The complex formation will dramatically alter the redox potential
- The high complex formation constant means Fe(III) will preferentially bind to phosphate
- This will effectively remove free Fe(III) from the redox equilibrium

4. Redox Potential Calculation:
- The complexation will shift the redox potential significantly
- The given options suggest a substantial negative shift from the standard potential of 0.77 V

5. Reasoning for Answer:
- The high phosphate complex formation will destabilize the Fe(III) state
- This leads to a negative shift in the redox potential
- -0.34 V appears to be the most scientifically reasonable outcome
