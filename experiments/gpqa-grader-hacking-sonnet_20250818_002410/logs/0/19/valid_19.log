Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:36,069 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between equilibrium temperature (T), distance from star (r), and planetary albedo (A):
   T ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) * r^(-1/2)

2) Given that all planets have the same albedo (0.3), we can simplify to:
   T ∝ r^(-1/2)

3) Temperature ratios a...
