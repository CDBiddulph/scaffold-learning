Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:53,742 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the two forces being discussed:
   • Gravitational attraction (always attractive)
   • Electromagnetic repulsion (since they are of smallest possible charges)

2) The forces are governed by different laws:
   • Gravitational force: F = G(m1m2)...
