Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:28,122 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the half-life of Caesium-137
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years

2) Calculate decay constant (λ)
• λ = ln(2) / Half-life
• λ = 0.693 / (30 * 365 * 24 * 60) minutes
• λ ≈ 1.5 × 10^-9 per minute

3) Calculate number of decays in 80...
