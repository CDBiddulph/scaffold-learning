2025-08-18 10:57:26,390 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) Starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O):
   • This molecule has 9 carbons
   • It has an aldehyde group (CHO)

2) Treatment with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent):
   • This adds a methyl group (-CH3)
   • Product 1 will now have 10 carbons
   • It's a ...
