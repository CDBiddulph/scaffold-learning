You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:54,295 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the pattern in the given inputs and outputs:
   • AGG → 115
   • TGCTGA → 176

2. I'll try to analyze how these values might be calculated:
   • Let's count the bases (A, T, G, C)
   • AGG has 1A, 0T, 2G, 0C
   • TGCTGA has 1A, 2T, 2G, 1C

3. T...
