bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV light
• This suggests a photochemical reaction
• Since the molecular weight remains the same, this is likely a photoisomerization or rearrangement
• A possible outcome is a ring-opened or rearranged ketone stru...
