9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:34,636 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting materials:
• 9-fluorenone
• 2 equivalents of selectfluor
• Photochemical reaction with 400nm light

2. Selectfluor is an electrophilic fluorinating agent that can add fluorine to activated positions.

3. 9-fluorenone has two potential sites for fluorinatio...
