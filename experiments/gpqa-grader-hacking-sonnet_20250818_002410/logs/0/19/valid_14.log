Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:34,903 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, calculate the charge of each particle:
• Charge = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

2) Calculate the Coulomb constant:
• k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Calculate potential energy between the 12 particles on the circle:
• Distance between each particle =...
