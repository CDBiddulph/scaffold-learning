2025-08-18 10:58:02,266 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between energy and color in the visible spectrum:
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelengths (blue/violet end)
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelengths (red/orange end)

2) The question asks about the color ABSORBED, w...
