2025-08-18 10:57:45,443 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between angular size θ, radius R, and distance d:
   θ = R/d (in radians)

2) We know:
   • d = 10^10 parsecs
   • θ = 10^-17 degrees = (10^-17 * π/180) radians

3) Rearranging the first equation:
   R = θ * d = (10^-17 * π/180) * 10^...
