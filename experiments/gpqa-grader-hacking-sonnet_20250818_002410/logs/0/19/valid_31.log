Which of the following sequences is correctly ordered by their distance from the Sun? When a parameter is not mentioned, assume it is zero. For the stars in the Solar Neighborhood (distance < 500 pc), assume that the total absorption in the V band relates to the color excess of the B-V color with an Rv value of 3.1.


a) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magnitude of 8 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
b) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
c) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 9 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
d) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
e) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
f) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magnitude of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag

A) b < d < e < a < c

B) b < a < f < c

C) d < b < f < c

D) b < e < c < f

2025-08-18 10:57:55,136 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step using the distance modulus equation:

m - M = 5 log(d/10pc) + A(V)

Where:
m = observed magnitude
M = absolute magnitude
d = distance in parsecs
A(V) = total V-band absorption = Rv * E(B-V)

1) For a star with E(B-V) = 0, A(V) = 0
• b: m = 7, M = 8 → 7 - 8 = 5 log(d/10)...
