For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:58:04,616 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall what Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) represent:
- They parameterize potential new physics contributions to electroweak precision measurements
- They are sensitive to loop-level corrections in the Standard Model

2) Multi-Higgs Doublet Models (MHDM) typic...
