Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:35,356 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this systematically:

1) In Feynman diagram terminology, the number of loops directly relates to the power of certain denominators and integration constants.

2) The key clue is the (1/4π)^6 term in the expression.

3) In general, for a loop diagram, the power of (1/4π) is related to the...
