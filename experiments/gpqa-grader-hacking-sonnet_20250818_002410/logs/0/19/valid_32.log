We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 10:57:54,860 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the situation:
   - Fe(III) concentration = 0.01 M
   - Fe(II) concentration = 0.01 M
   - pH = 1.0
   - Total phosphate concentration = 0.1 M
   - H2PO4^- concentration = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
   - Standard reduction potential of Fe(III)/Fe(II) = ...
