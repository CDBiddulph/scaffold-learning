2025-08-18 10:57:35,253 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) represents:
• It's an effective field theory describing physics beyond the Standard Model
• It must respect fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory

2. Lorentz Symmetry:
• Describes i...
