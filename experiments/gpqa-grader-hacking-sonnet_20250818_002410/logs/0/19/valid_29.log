Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:44,922 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the conditions for a molecule to be optically active:
• Must have at least one chiral center
• Chiral center requires at least 4 different substituents
• Typically requires an asymmetric carbon

2) We need to analyze the molecular formula of each data...
