2025-08-18 10:57:27,424 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between mass, volume, and density: 
   Density = Mass / Volume

2) For the first option (a): 
   • An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have the same density as Earth
   • Earth's density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³
   • This me...
