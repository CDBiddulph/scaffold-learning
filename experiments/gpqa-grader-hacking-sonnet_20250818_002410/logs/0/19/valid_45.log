In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, understand the initial conditions:
   • Total initial volume of A and B: Let this be 1 unit
   • Volume of C: 2.25 units
   • A:B volume ratio is 1:1

2) Let's define variables:
   • Let molecular mass of A be x
   • Let molecular mass of B be y
   • Let mol...
