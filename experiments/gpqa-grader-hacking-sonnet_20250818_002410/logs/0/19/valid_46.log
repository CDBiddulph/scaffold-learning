The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 10:58:02,908 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   • T ∝ E_peak

2) For star A, peak energy is 7.21 eV
   • For the sun, peak energy is 1.41 eV

3) Calculate temperature ratio:
   • T_A / T_sun = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

4) Recall the lu...
