Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:57:45,025 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s:
• Distance = Speed × Time
• Time = 1e-5s
• Starting height = 13000m

2) Calculate the distance for each particle:
• Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5s = 28,800m
• Eta (0.9c): 0.9 × ...
