Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

2025-08-18 10:57:27,815 [INFO] LLM response (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑(2l+1) sin(2δl)

2) Here, k is the wave number
   • Recall k = √(2μE/ℏ²)
   • E = 50 MeV

3) The given phase shifts are:
   • δ0 = 90°
   • δ1 = 67°
   • δ2 = 55°
