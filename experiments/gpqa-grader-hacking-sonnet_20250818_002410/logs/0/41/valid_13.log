2025-08-18 11:14:28,084 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the context:
- SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory
- This theory must respect fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory

2. Let's analyze each symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental symmetry of special relativity
