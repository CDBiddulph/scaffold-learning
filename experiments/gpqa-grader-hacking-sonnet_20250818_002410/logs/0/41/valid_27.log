An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:39,407 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the expectation value formula for spin operators:
   <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4). This means ψ = [3i, 4]^T

3) Let's first compute σ_y * ψ:
   σ_y * ψ = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} * \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\...
