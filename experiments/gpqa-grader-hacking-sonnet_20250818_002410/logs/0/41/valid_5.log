Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

2025-08-18 11:14:20,814 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum scattering theory, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts by the formula:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δl)

2) Here, k is the wave number, l is the angular momentum quantum number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), and ...
