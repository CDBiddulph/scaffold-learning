You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:46,788 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the patterns in the given input-output pairs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. This suggests some kind of calculation based on the DNA sequence.

3. Let's look closely at the sequence and value for each example:
   AGG: 3 letters â†’ 115
   TGC...
