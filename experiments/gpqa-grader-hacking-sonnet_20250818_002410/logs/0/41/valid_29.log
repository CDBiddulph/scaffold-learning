Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:38,061 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall what makes a compound optically active:
- Must contain a chiral carbon (carbon with 4 different substituents)
- Requires an asymmetric carbon center

2. Analyze the percentage composition:
- All entries are consistent with a hydrocarbon
- Need to dete...
