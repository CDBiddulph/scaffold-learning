# Internal validation function (hidden from the model)
def validate_answer(answer: str) -> bool:
    return answer == "C"
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:19,152 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate's operation:
   - If the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In the given input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩
   - The firs...
