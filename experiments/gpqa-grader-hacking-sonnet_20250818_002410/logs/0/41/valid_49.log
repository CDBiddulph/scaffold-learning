bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-18 11:14:57,378 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the structure of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one:
   - It's a bicyclic ketone with a rigid cage-like structure
   - The ketone group is at position 2

2) UV irradiation suggests a photochemical reaction:
   - This likely causes a [2+2] photocycloa...
