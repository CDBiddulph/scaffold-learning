Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:37,488 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent Effects on Para Substitution:
- The orientation of substitution depends on the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature of the substituent.
- Activatin...
