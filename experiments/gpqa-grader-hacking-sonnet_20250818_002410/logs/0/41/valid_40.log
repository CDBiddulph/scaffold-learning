A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 11:14:54,265 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key principles:
   - c is the speed of light in vacuum (given as 1 in this problem)
   - n is the index of refraction of the glass
   - v is the velocity of the glass in the direction of light propagation

2) In a stationary medium, the speed of l...
