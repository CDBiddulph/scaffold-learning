A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:44,711 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the starting material:
• 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol is a compound with two phenyl groups and two hydroxyl groups

2. The reaction conditions involve acid, which typically triggers:
• Dehydration (removal of water)
• Potential elimination reaction...
