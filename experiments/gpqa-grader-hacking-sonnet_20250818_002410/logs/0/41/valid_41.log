2025-08-18 11:14:53,058 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the color of light absorbed is complementary to the color of light emitted.

2) The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV.

3) To determine the color of absorbed light, we'll convert this energy to wavelength using the equation:
