Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:28,613 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the charge interactions:
   • Total charge at point P = 2e
   • 12 particles, each 2e at 2m from point P
   • We'll use Coulomb's law: U = kq1q2/r

2) Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Each charge is 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2...
