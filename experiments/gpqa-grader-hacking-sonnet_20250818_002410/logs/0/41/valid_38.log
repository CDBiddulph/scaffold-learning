2025-08-18 11:14:48,147 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the Cope rearrangement:
- It's a concerted thermal rearrangement of 1,5-dienes
- Involves migration of substituents to create a new Ïƒ bond
- Preserves stereochemistry in a symmetrical manner

2) Analyze the starting molecule:
- This is a bic...
