Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:14:19,250 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall some key facts about Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
• It decays by emitting beta particles and gamma rays

2) Calculate decay constant (λ):
• ln(2)/half-life = λ
• λ = ln(2)/(30 years × 365 days × 24 hours)
• This i...
