2025-08-18 11:14:18,967 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O) is treated with methylmagnesium bromide:
   • This forms a carbinol (alcohol) product (product 1)
   • The reaction adds a methyl group
   • Product 1 now has 10 carbon atoms

2) Product 1 is then treated with pyridinium chloroch...
