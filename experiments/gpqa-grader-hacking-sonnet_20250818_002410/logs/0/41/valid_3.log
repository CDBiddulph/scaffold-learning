2025-08-18 11:14:20,336 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume.

2. For option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
• This would have the exact same density as Earth
• Earth's density is approximately 5.5 g/cm^3
• No change in density from Earth's baseline

3. For option b: A pl...
