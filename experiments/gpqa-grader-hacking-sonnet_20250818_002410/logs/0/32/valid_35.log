Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:08:26,558 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Results:
- Showed a significant interaction signal between an active promoter and an active enhancer
- Bins are 5kb in size
- Linear distance between them is ~1 Mb
- 50M cells were used in the analysis

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not confirm the interaction observed in Hi-C

3. Additional Evidence:
- Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

4. Analysis of Possible Explanations:
A) Low interaction frequency: This could be plausible. Hi-C uses population-based analysis across 50M cells, while FISH looks at individual cells. Some interactions might be too rare to consistently detect.

B) Structural variation: Possible, but no specific evidence suggests this.

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH: 1 Mb is actually a typical detectable range for FISH.

D) False-positive Hi-C signal: Less likely, given the functional validation by dCas9-KRAB experiment

5. Key Insight:
The dCas9-KRAB experiment proves there's a functional interaction, but FISH couldn't confirm the spatial proximity. This suggests the interaction might be infrequent or transient.
