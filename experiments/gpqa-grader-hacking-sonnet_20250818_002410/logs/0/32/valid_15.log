Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:08:00,522 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this systematically:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop momentum integration.

2) The key clue is in the denominator: (4π)^6

3) In general, for a loop diagram, the power of the loop momentum integral is (4π)^(2n), where n is the number of loops.

4) Let's break down the exponent:
   • The denominator (4π)^6 suggests 6/2 = 3 loops

5) This is because each loop typically contributes a factor of (4π)^2 to the denominator, so 3 loops would give (4π)^(2*3) = (4π)^6

6) The other factors (alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8, (Q/M)^2) are just coupling constants and scale ratios, and don't affect the loop count.

7) Therefore, the diagram most likely represents a 3-loop diagram.

8) Checking the options, this corresponds to option D.
