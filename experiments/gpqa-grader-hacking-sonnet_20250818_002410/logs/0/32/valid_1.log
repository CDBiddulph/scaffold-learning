Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:07:51,098 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Decay characteristics of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
• Decays by beta radiation, followed by gamma emission
• Emits gamma rays with energy around 662 keV

2. Total number of atoms:
• Number of atoms = 10^17

3. Radioactive decay calculation:
• In 80 minutes (1.33 hours), decay is negligible
• Assume all atoms are capable of emitting gamma rays

4. Gamma ray emission probability:
• Each decay produces gamma rays
• Typical gamma emission probability: ~85%

5. Detector considerations:
• Detector size: 2 x 3 cm = 6 cm²
• Distance from source: 4 meters
• Solid angle calculation and detection efficiency will reduce detected rays

6. Rough estimate calculation:
• If each decay emits 1 gamma ray per atom
• Total potential gamma rays: 10^17 × 0.85
• Detector efficiency at 4m: ~10^-6
• Detected gamma rays: 10^17 × 0.85 × 10^-6 ≈ 10^6

7. Comparing with given options, this matches option C: 1 million (10^6)
