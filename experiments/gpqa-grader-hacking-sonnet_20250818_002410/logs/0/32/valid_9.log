2025-08-18 11:07:49,494 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given molecule:
   • 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid

2) When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, this is a reduction reaction:
   • Red phosphorus and HI are strong reducing agents
   • They will reduce all functional groups (aldehyde, carboxylic acid, alkene)

3) Let's track the changes:
   • Aldehyde (-CHO) will be reduced to -CH2OH
   • Carboxylic acid (-COOH) will be reduced to -CH2OH
   • Alkene (double bond) will be converted to single bond
   • Vinyl group will also be reduced to -CH2CH3

4) The reduced molecule will have:
   • All single bonds
   • No additional rings
   • No multiple bonds
   • No oxygen-containing groups

5) Index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) calculation:
   • IHD = Number of rings + Number of double bonds
   • In this case, rings = 1
   • Double bonds = 0
   • IHD = 1 + 0 = 1
