2025-08-18 11:08:35,009 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
• The energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength/higher frequency colors
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength/lower frequency colors

2) The problem gives the emission energy as 2.3393 eV

3) When a substance emits light, it means it has first absorbed a different color of light

4) To determine the absorbed color, we need to look at the complementary color on the visible spectrum

5) Let's convert the energy to wavelength using the equation E = hc/λ
• h (Planck's constant) = 4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s
• c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
• λ = (hc)/E = (4.136 × 10^-15 × 3 × 10^8) / 2.3393
• λ ≈ 530 nm (green-yellow region)

6) The complementary color to green-yellow is violet/blue

7) Violet is the most specific match
