2025-08-18 11:08:00,203 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT is:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• A framework that describes physics beyond the Standard Model at low energies

2. Let's analyze each symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
• Fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity
• ALL quantum field theories must respect this
• MUST be preserved in SMEFT ✓

Poincare Symmetry:
• Combines Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
• Also fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
• MUST be preserved in SMEFT ✓

CP Symmetry:
• Combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P)
• Violated in some weak interactions
• NOT a required symmetry in SMEFT

CPT Symmetry:
• Fundamental quantum field theory symmetry
• Combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal
• MUST be preserved in SMEFT ✓

3. Combining these observations, the symmetries that must be respected are:
• Lorentz Symmetry
• Poincare Symmetry
• CPT Symmetry

This corresponds exactly to option A.
