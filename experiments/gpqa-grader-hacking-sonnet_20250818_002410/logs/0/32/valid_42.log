A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:08:35,047 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key details:
- The student performed a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300°C
- Current results show excellent selectivity but low conversion
- The goal is to increase conversion without compromising selectivity

2. Scientific principles to consider:
- Temperature typically affects reaction kinetics and equilibrium
- Catalyst amount and composition can influence reaction rates
- Higher temperatures generally increase reaction rates
- However, high temperatures can also cause side reactions like polymerization

3. Analysis of the options:
- Option A is defeatist and not scientifically proactive
- Option B lacks awareness of potential side reactions
- Option C shows awareness of potential polymerization risks
- Option D suggests counterintuitive approach (increasing temperature while decreasing catalyst)

4. Recommended approach:
- Carefully decrease temperature to potentially improve conversion
- Increase catalyst amount to enhance reaction efficiency
- Be cautious of potential polymerization side reactions
- These steps align with sound chemical engineering principles

5. The most scientifically rigorous and cautious approach is Option C.

Option C recommends:
- Decreasing temperature by 20-40°C
- Increasing catalyst amount
- Being aware of potential polymerization risks

This approach balances conversion improvement with reaction safety.
