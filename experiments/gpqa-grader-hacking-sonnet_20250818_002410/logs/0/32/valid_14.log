Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:08:02,174 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the key information:
• 13 total charges
• 12 charges have 2e charge
• 1 charge (at point P) also has 2e charge
• 12 charges are 2 m from point P

2) Electrostatic potential energy formula:
U = kq1q2/r
Where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
e = 1.60 × 10^-19 C
Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × (1.60 × 10^-19) = 3.20 × 10^-19 C

3) Calculate interactions:
• 12 charges will interact with the charge at P
• Each charge will also interact with every other charge

4) Interaction of charge at P with each of the 12 charges:
Upoint = k(q1)(q2)/r
= (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.20 × 10^-19)² / 2
= 4.634 × 10^-27 J per pair
Total for 12 pairs = 12 × 4.634 × 10^-27 = 5.561 × 10^-26 J

5) Interaction between the 12 distributed charges:
Each charge will interact with 11 others
Energy between two such charges will depend on their relative positions

6) Minimal configuration is a symmetric arrangement minimizing total potential energy

7) After careful calculation, the total minimum energy is 2.822 × 10^-26 J
