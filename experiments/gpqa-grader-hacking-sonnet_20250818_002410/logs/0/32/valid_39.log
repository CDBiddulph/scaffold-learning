ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 11:08:27,201 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experiment:
- ChIP-seq was performed to map IKAROS transcription factor binding sites
- Two different fixation methods were used: PFA alone and PFA+DSG
- Peaks seen with PFA fixation disappeared with PFA+DSG fixation

2. Characteristics of fixation methods:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) creates short-range crosslinks
- PFA+DSG creates more robust, longer-range crosslinks
- Longer-range crosslinks can mask or disrupt protein-DNA interactions

3. Where are protein-DNA interactions most sensitive to crosslinking?
- Weak or transient interactions are most likely to be disrupted
- These typically occur at dynamic regulatory regions

4. Typical locations of dynamic protein-DNA interactions:
- Active promoters and enhancers are regions of frequent protein binding and chromatin remodeling
- These sites often have open chromatin and multiple transcription factors
- Interactions here are more transient and sensitive to crosslinking conditions

5. Analyzing the options:
- A: Random locations - unlikely
- B: Repeats - typically less dynamic
- C: Introns - generally less active
- D: Active promoters and enhancers - most consistent with the observation
