A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:08:18,309 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, note the key conditions:
- Spherically symmetric wave function
- Time-independent
- Imaginary part is zero
- Outer sphere radius is 100 times inner sphere radius
- Probability of finding particle between d1 and 2*d1 is P
- Probability of finding particle between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P

2) This suggests the probability density must decrease proportionally to how the spherical shell volume changes with radius.

3) The volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr:
- Shell from r1 to r2 has volume ∝ (r2^3 - r1^3)

4) Given the probabilities are equal (P) for shells of equal width:
- Volume of first shell (d1 to 2*d1) must equal volume of second shell (2*d1 to 3*d1)

5) This implies the wave function's probability density must be proportional to 1/r^2.

6) Mathematically, this means the wave function itself has the form of 1/r.

7) This ensures equal probability for shells of constant dr, despite varying volumes.

Answer: A

Key reasoning: The 1/r dependence ensures equal probability for consecutive spherical shells of constant width, consistent with the problem's constraints.
