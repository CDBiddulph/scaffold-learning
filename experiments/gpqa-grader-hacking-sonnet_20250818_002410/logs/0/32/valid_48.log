In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:08:35,875 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the problem:
- The scientist wants to create an ethylene polymer with regular branches
- This requires a dual catalyst system
- Only ethylene is used as the monomer

2. Let's evaluate the statements critically:

A) "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US"
- This sounds like a factual statement about existing technology
- Industrial polymerization techniques are constantly evolving
- This statement appears plausible

B) "Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step"
- Aluminum compounds are common in polymerization catalysis
- The statement implies a specific limitation of aluminum activators
- Requires verification against current catalysis research

C) "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators"
- Group VIa metals include chromium, molybdenum, tungsten
- These metals have known catalytic properties in polymerization
- The statement seems technically sound

D) "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive"
- Noble metals like platinum are known catalysts
- They are typically very expensive for large-scale industrial processes
- This statement appears technically accurate

3. Cross-referencing scientific knowledge suggests that option A is most likely correct.
