Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:08:26,174 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key information:
- Satellites are detecting astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Analyzing localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large uncertainty
- This suggests the objects are very far away
- Large localization uncertainty implies great distance

3. Evaluating the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
   - These are extremely large cosmic distances
   - Consistent with large localization uncertainty
   - Typical of extragalactic objects

B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years
   - Within our galaxy
   - Consistent with satellite detection capabilities
   - Reasonable localization precision

C) 10 or 100 light years
   - Very close, within our local stellar neighborhood
   - Too near to match the described large localization uncertainty

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - Very close to Earth
   - Much too near to match the described detection scenario

4. Conclusion:
Option A provides distances most consistent with the described detection characteristics.
