2025-08-18 11:08:36,531 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV light
• This suggests a photochemical reaction
• The molecular weight remains the same, indicating a rearrangement
• The most likely process is a photochemical Norrish Type II reaction
• This involves hydrogen abstraction and forming a diradical species
• The product is likely an enol or an aldehyde

2) When the first product is treated with H2/Pd/C
• This suggests hydrogenation
• The H2/Pd/C conditions will reduce any unsaturated functionalities
• If an enol or aldehyde was formed, it would be converted to a saturated ketone
• This means the product will be fully saturated

3) In the final molecule
• It's a saturated bicyclic ketone
• The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one adjacent to the carbonyl group
• This hydrogen would experience coupling from its neighboring hydrogens
• This environment suggests a doublet of doublets splitting pattern

4) Examining the splitting pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen:
• Doublet of doublets indicates coupling with two different neighboring hydrogens
• This matches the expected environment
