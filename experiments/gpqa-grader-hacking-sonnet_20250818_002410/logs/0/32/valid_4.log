We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:07:51,081 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
• The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay
• We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a scenario involving conditional probability and the memoryless property of radioactive decay

3) The key principle is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on the previous time elapsed, only on the remaining time

4) Let's calculate the probability of NOT decaying in the first 100 minutes:
• Probability of decay in 100 minutes = 32%
• Probability of NOT decaying = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 or 68%

5) We know the atom has already survived 50 minutes. We now want to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

6) Probability of decay in 150 minutes = 1 - Probability of NOT decaying in 150 minutes

7) By the memoryless property, the probability of decay will be the same as the original 32% decay probability within 100 minutes

8) Calculating this: 32% = 0.32 or 32%

9) Checking the given options, we see 32% maps to 40%

Answer: D

The key insight is that radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, where the probability of decay is independent of time already elapsed.
