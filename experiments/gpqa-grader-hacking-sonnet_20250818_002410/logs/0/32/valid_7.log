There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 11:07:50,502 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the operation of a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate:
   - If the control qubit (first qubit) is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped (|0⟩ → |1⟩ and |1⟩ → |0⟩)

2) In this case, the condition is that the first qubit must be |0⟩

3) The input state is |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

4) Since the control qubit is |0⟩, the C-NOT gate will NOT change the target qubit

5) This means the output state will remain the same as the input state

6) Examining the options:
   - Option A is identical to the input state
   - Option B changes the target qubit to |1⟩
   - Option C rearranges the state
   - Option D rearranges the state differently

7) The input condition was a control qubit of |0⟩, which means no change occurs

8) Therefore, the output will be the same as the input
