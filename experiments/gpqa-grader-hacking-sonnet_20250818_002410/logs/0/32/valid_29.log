Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 11:08:15,454 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) To be optically active, a molecule must:
   - Have a chiral carbon center (asymmetric carbon)
   - Be non-superimposable on its mirror image

2) This requires the molecule to have:
   - At least one carbon with 4 different substituents
   - Typically an uneven number of carbons

3) Let's calculate the molecular formula for each option:
   A) C5H12 (pentane)
   B) C6H14 (hexane)
   C) C4H10 (butane)
   D) C7H16 (heptane)

4) Check molecular structure and chirality:
   A) Pentane: Symmetric, no chiral center
   B) Hexane: 2-methylpentane has a chiral center
   C) Butane: Symmetric, no chiral center
   D) Heptane: 3-methylhexane has a chiral center

5) Criteria match with option B (2-methylhexane)
   - Correct molecular formula
   - Contains a chiral carbon
   - Mass spectrum consistent with structure

Answer: B
