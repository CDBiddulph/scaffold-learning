All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 11:08:01,725 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement carefully:

A) This statement discusses the frameshifting mechanism in SARS-CoV-2. The claim about the linear correlation of frameshifting rate with pseudoknot conformations and the similarity to other pseudoknots appears scientifically sound. No obvious errors are present.

B) This statement describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. The description of the heterodimer functioning in mismatch repair and preventing dsRNA breakdown seems technically accurate based on current molecular virology understanding.

C) This statement explains the ORF3a protein's role in apoptosis. The description of caspase-8 activation through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, without affecting Bcl-2 levels, appears consistent with known viral apoptosis mechanisms.

D) This statement discusses programmed ribosomal frameshifting. The critical issue is the last part claiming that "SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting."

Recent research has shown that while SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share similarities in frameshifting, they do NOT have exactly the same conformation. SARS-CoV-2 has some distinct structural variations in its frameshifting signal.

This subtle but important difference makes statement D scientifically incorrect.

Therefore, the statement that is NOT correct is D.
