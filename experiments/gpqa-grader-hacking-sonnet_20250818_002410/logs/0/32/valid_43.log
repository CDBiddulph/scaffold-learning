You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 11:08:35,175 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the requirements:
- We need to clone the sequence into the expression vector
- We want directional cloning
- We'll use PCR primers with restriction sites

2. Look at the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) in the vector:
- Contains HindIII and KpnI sites
- These are potential cloning sites

3. Analyze the primer sequences:
- They must contain the start and stop codons of the gene
- Must have appropriate restriction sites for directional cloning

4. Check primer characteristics:
- Option A: HindIII (forward), KpnI (reverse)
- Option B: HindIII (forward), BamHI (reverse)
- Option C: SmaI (forward), BamHI (reverse)
- Option D: BamHI (forward), HindIII (reverse)

5. Requirements for correct cloning:
- Forward primer should have HindIII site
- Reverse primer should have KpnI site
- Allows correct orientation in vector
- Preserves reading frame

6. Option A meets all these criteria perfectly:
- Forward primer starts with HindIII site
- Reverse primer starts with KpnI site
- Allows directional cloning into the vector's MCS
