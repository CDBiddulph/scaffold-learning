A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 11:08:01,976 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Scenario:
- The scientist used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The transgenic animal developed with different genomes in different cell lineages
- This suggests mosaicism (genetic variation) occurred during embryo development

2. Key Scientific Principles:
- In early embryonic development, cells divide rapidly
- Gene editing occurs in the initial cell(s)
- If gene editing is not complete or uniform in the first few cell divisions, some cells will have the edit and some won't

3. Analyzing the Options:
- Option A: Converting messenger RNA to cDNA is not a typical mechanism of genetic variation
- Option B: Guide RNA-donor DNA complex integration is not a standard CRISPR mechanism
- Option C: Surrogate mother's DNA incorporation is highly unlikely
- Option D: Continuous DNA cutting and donor DNA incorporation during embryo development is the most plausible explanation

4. Detailed Reasoning for Option D:
- If Cas9 continues to cut DNA at different stages of embryo development
- Different cells will incorporate donor DNA at different times
- This leads to genetic variations across cell lineages
- Results in a mosaic genome where different tissues have different genetic compositions

5. Conclusion:
The most probable cause of differing genomes across cell lineages is continuous DNA cutting and donor DNA incorporation during embryo development.
