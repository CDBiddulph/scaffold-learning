S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 11:08:18,056 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S to 1):
- The TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl) chloride protects the hydroxyl group
- This creates a silyl ether, blocking the hydroxyl group from further reactions

2) Second reaction (1 to 2):
- Ph2CuLi is a organocuprate reagent that adds a phenyl group
- Low temperature allows controlled addition
- Benzyl bromide then adds a benzyl group
- This introduces a phenyl and a benzyl substituent

3) Third reaction (2 to 3):
- LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) deprotonates at the Î±-position
- Iodomethane adds a methyl group
- This creates a new methyl substituent

4) Final reaction (3 to 4):
- Aqueous HCl removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the original hydroxyl group
- Combines all previous modifications

After analyzing the transformations, the final structure should have:
- A hydroxyl group
- A phenyl group
- A benzyl group
- A methyl group
- A cyclohexanone backbone

This matches option C: (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
