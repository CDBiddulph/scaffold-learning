2025-08-18 11:08:35,090 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law: λ_max * T = constant
   This relates the peak wavelength to temperature

2) Peak photon energy relates to temperature by E = kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant

3) For the sun: Peak photon energy = 1.41 eV
   For star A: Peak photon energy = 7.21 eV

4) Temperature ratio can be calculated:
   T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

5) Luminosity is related to radius and temperature by:
   L ∝ R² * T⁴

6) We're given that star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

7) Let's set up the equation:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴

8) Solving for R/R_sun:
   (R/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   R/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   R/R_sun = 0.19

9) This matches option B.
