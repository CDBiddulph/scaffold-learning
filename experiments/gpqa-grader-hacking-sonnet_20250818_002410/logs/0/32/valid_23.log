2025-08-18 11:08:11,487 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log(distance in parsecs) - 5

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) A star with Vmag = 7 at 50 parsecs
   • Already given an apparent magnitude
   • No calculation needed

b) A star with Vmag = 7 at 20 parsecs
   • Already given an apparent magnitude
   • No calculation needed

c) Two-star system: Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8, both at 5 parsecs
   • Need to calculate combined apparent magnitude
   • Combined magnitude = -2.5 log(10^(-0.4*7) + 10^(-0.4*8))
   • This requires complex calculation

d) Star with absolute Vmag = 7 at 10 parsecs
   • At 10 parsecs, apparent magnitude equals absolute magnitude
   • Vmag = 7

e and f) Similar two-star systems at 10 parsecs
   • Require magnitude combination calculations

3) Comparing given apparent magnitudes:
   • Option b has the same apparent magnitude as option a
   • Option d has a direct 7 mag

4) Key principle: Closer stars appear brighter

5) By comparing the apparent magnitudes and distances, option b (7 mag at 20 parsecs) is brighter than most other options.
