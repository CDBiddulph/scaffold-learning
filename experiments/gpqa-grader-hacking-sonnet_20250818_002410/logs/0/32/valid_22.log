Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:08:18,110 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):
- The reactivity depends on substituent effects
- Substituents can be activating or deactivating
- Substituents can direct to ortho, meta, or para positions

2) Let's analyze each substituent's effect:
- CH3 (1): Strongly activating, strongly para-directing
- COOC2H5 (2): Weakly deactivating, meta-directing
- Cl (3): Weakly deactivating, meta-directing
- NO2 (4): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing
- C2H5 (5): Activating, para-directing
- COOH (6): Moderately deactivating, meta-directing

3) Para-isomer yield order:
- CH3 (1): Very high para yield
- C2H5 (5): High para yield
- COOH (6): Low para yield
- COOC2H5 (2): Very low para yield
- Cl (3): Very low para yield
- NO2 (4): Extremely low para yield

4) Arranging from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:
4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5

This matches option B.
