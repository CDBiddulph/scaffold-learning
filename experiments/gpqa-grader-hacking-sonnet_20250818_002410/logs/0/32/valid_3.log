2025-08-18 11:07:50,738 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the density formula:
   Density = Mass / Volume

2) Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
   • This would have the same density as Earth (5.5 g/cm³)
   • Density is constant if mass and volume remain proportional

3) Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³:
   • Explicitly stated density of 5.5 g/cm³
   • This suggests a uniform composition similar to Earth

4) Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive:
   • If mass increases 5 times, volume will also increase 5 times
   • Density = Mass / Volume remains constant at 5.5 g/cm³

5) Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:
   • If mass decreases by half, volume will also decrease by half
   • Density = Mass / Volume remains constant at 5.5 g/cm³

6) Comparison:
   • All options have essentially the same density of 5.5 g/cm³
   • No option shows a different density principle

7) Therefore, density is uniform across all options.

Answer: B

The key understanding is that for a planet with uniform composition, increasing or decreasing mass proportionally changes volume, keeping density constant.
