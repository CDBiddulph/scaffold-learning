A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 11:08:28,679 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the situation:
   - We have a light beam traveling through a moving glass medium
   - The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
   - We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer

2) This scenario involves relative motion and the behavior of light in moving media

3) The key principle here is the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   u' = (u - v) / (1 - u*v/cÂ²)
   Where:
   u = speed of light in glass
   v = velocity of glass
   c = speed of light in vacuum

4) In this problem, we're told that c = 1, and the speed in glass is n (the refractive index)

5) Substituting these values into the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   u' = (n - v) / (1 - n*v)

6) Rearranging this gives:
   u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) Looking at the given options, this matches option D exactly

8) This formula accounts for both the refractive index and the motion of the medium
