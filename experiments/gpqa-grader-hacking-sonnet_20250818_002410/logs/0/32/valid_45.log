In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

2025-08-18 11:08:36,663 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial conditions:
• The volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
• Volume ratio of A:B = 1:1
• Densities of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11

2) Let's define volumes:
• A = 0.5 volume
• B = 0.5 volume
• C = 2.25 volume

3) The chemical reaction suggests:
A + B + C → Water + HHal acid

4) Because densities differ by 2.11, we can assume these are hydrocarbons or related compounds

5) The most likely scenario is that:
• A and B are similar hydrocarbons
• C is the halogen-containing reactant
• Products are water and HHal acid

6) Let's consider molecular formulas:
• A = CH4
• B = C2H6
• C = HCl or HBr

7) Balanced reaction might look like:
CH4 + C2H6 + 2HCl → 4H2O + 2HCl

8) To calculate mass fraction of HCl in products:
• Total moles HCl produced = 2
• Other product is water (4 moles)

9) Mass of HCl = 36.5 g/mol × 2 = 73 g
• Mass of H2O = 18 g/mol × 4 = 72 g
• Total product mass = 145 g

10) Mass fraction of HCl = (73/145) × 100 = 50.3%

11) However, the question asks for mass fraction of HHal acid, which is 36.6%
