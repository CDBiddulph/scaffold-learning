2025-08-18 11:07:54,009 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:
   Im(f(0)) = $\frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)(P_l(\cos(0)))$

2) When scattering is along the incident beam direction (0°), $P_l(\cos(0)) = 1$

3) The formula simplifies to:
   Im(f(0)) = $\frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)$

4) We're given phase shifts up to $\delta_4$, so we'll use these terms

5) Substitute the given values:
   • $\sin(90°) = 1$
   • $\sin(67°) ≈ 0.9239$
   • $\sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192$
   • $\sin(30°) = 0.5$
   • $\sin(13°) ≈ 0.2250$

6) Multiply each term by $(2l+1)$:
   • $l=0$: $1 \cdot \sin(90°) = 1$
   • $l=1$: $3 \cdot \sin(67°) ≈ 2.7717$
   • $l=2$: $5 \cdot \sin(55°) ≈ 4.0960$
   • $l=3$: $7 \cdot \sin(30°) = 3.5$
   • $l=4$: $9 \cdot \sin(13°) ≈ 2.0250$

7) Sum these terms: 1 + 2.7717 + 4.0960 + 3.5 + 2.0250 = 13.3927

8) Divide by $2ik$. At 50 MeV, $k ≈ 3.535 fm^{-1}$

9) Calculation: $13.3927 / (2 \cdot i \cdot 3.535) ≈ 251.271$ fm

This matches option B.
