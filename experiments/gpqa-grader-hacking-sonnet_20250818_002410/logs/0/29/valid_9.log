2025-08-18 11:05:29,469 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's look at the starting molecule:
   • 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
   • Contains a carbonyl group (formyl), a vinyl group, a double bond, and a carboxylic acid group

2) When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI:
   • This is a reducing and halogenating reaction
   • HI will reduce the carbonyl groups
   • The double bond will be saturated
   • The vinyl group will be converted to an alkyl group

3) After the reaction, the molec...
