S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 11:05:48,202 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S to 1):
• S is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine
• This means a silyl protection is added to the hydroxyl group
• Product 1 has a silyl ether protecting the hydroxyl group

2) Second reaction (1 to 2):
• Ph2CuLi at low temperature suggests a phenyl group is added
• Followed by benzyl bromide, which adds a benzyl group
• Product 2 will have a phenyl and a benzyl substituent

3) Third reaction (2 to 3):
• LDA and iod...
