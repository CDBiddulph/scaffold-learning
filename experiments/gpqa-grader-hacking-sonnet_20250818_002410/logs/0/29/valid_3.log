a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b

2025-08-18 11:05:30,392 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume.

2. For option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
• This would have the exact same density as Earth
• Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³
• Volume is the same as Earth's

3. For option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³:
• This implies the planet has more mass but the same density as Earth
• Unlikely to be the highest density

4. For option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth...
