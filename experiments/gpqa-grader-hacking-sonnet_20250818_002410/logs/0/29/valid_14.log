Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:39,469 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the system:
   • 13 total charges
   • 12 charges are 2m from point P
   • 1 charge is at point P
   • Each charge is 2e

2) Calculate potential energy:
   • Energy between charges depends on their separation and magnitude of charge
   • Energy = k * q1 * q2 / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²)
   • Each charge is 2e = 2 * (1.6 × 10^-19) C

3) Calculate charge interactions:
   • 13th charge at P interacts with other 12 char...
