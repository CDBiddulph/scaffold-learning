9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:38,075 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The reactants are 9-fluorenone and selectfluor, under 400nm light conditions.

2) The product has two fluorine signals:
   • One at +29.8 ppm
   • Another at -115.7 ppm

3) This suggests the product has two different fluorine environments.

4) The reaction involves photochemical fluorination with selectfluor.

5) Looking at the options, we're looking for a product with two fluorine substituents.

6) The position of the fluorines matters.

7) Option A "2,6-diflu...
