2025-08-18 11:06:05,568 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the visible light spectrum and its energy ranges:
• Violet: ~3.1 - 2.5 eV
• Blue: ~3.0 - 2.5 eV
• Green: ~2.5 - 2.2 eV
• Yellow: ~2.2 - 1.9 eV
• Orange: ~1.9 - 1.7 eV
• Red: ~1.7 - 1.5 eV

2. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV.

3. When a material emits light of a certain energy, it typically absorbs the complementary color.

4. 2.3393 eV falls in the green region of the energy spectrum.

5. The complementary color to green is red.
