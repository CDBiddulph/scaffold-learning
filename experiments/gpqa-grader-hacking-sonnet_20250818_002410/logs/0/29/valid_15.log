Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:39,101 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram corresponds to the power of loop momenta in the integral.

2) The key to determining the number of loops is often found in the power of the denominators and the integrated loop momenta.

3) Let's look at the explicit part of the expression: 1/(4pi)^6

4) The power of 1/(4pi) is 6, which suggests 6 loop momenta are being integrated over.

5) When a Feynman diagram has L loops, the denominator in t...
