Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:29,915 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the half-life and decay characteristics of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
• Each Cs-137 atom decays by emitting a gamma ray

2) Calculate number of decays in 80 minutes:
• With 10^17 total atoms
• Average decay rate depends on time and half-life
• Roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of atoms will have decayed in 80 minutes

3) Estimate total gamma-ray emissions:
• Approximately 3 x 10^16 gamma rays emitted

4) Consider detector geometry...
