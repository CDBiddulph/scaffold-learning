You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:58,919 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the given examples:
   • AGG gives 115
   • TGCTGA gives 176

2. We need to find a pattern or rule that generates these outputs

3. Let's count some things about the inputs:
   • AGG (3 letters): 115
   • TGCTGA (6 letters): 176

4. A possible rule might involve counting the letters and multiplying:
   • For AGG: (A=1, G=2, G=2), so maybe (1+2+2) * something
   • For TGCTGA: (T=4, G=2, C=3, T=4, G=2, A=1)

5. Let's try a rule: Sum the lette...
