ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:59,528 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the context:
- ChIP-seq was performed on PFA-fixed human B cells targeting IKAROS transcription factor
- Peaks disappeared when crosslinking method changed from PFA to PFA+DSG

2. Consider what this might indicate:
- The disappearance of peaks suggests that the original crosslinking method (PFA) captured protein-DNA interactions differently
- This likely means the peaks represent more transient or dynamic protein interactions

3. What type of genomic...
