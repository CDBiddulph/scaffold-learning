The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-18 11:06:07,182 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak wavelength/energy to temperature
   - Sun's peak: 1.41 eV
   - Star A's peak: 7.21 eV

2) The ratio of peak energies is: 7.21/1.41 = 5.11
   - This indicates Star A is much hotter than the Sun

3) Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law relates luminosity to radius and temperature:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴

4) We know Star A is 24 times more luminous than the Sun

5) We can rearrange the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   R² = L/T⁴

6) Th...
