In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:06:08,229 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, note the initial volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25

2) We're told the gases A and B are in a 1:1 volume ratio

3) Possible molecular formulas/ratios:
   • Possible A = CxHy
   • Possible B = CxHy
   • C is likely a halogenated hydrocarbon

4) Products are water and HHal acid, suggesting a complete combustion/halogenation reaction

5) Let's assume 1 mole of total reactant gases
   • A:B = 1:1 volume
   • (A+B):C = 1:2.25 volume
   • Total gas volume = 1 + ...
