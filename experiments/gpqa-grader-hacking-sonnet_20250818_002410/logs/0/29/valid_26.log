2025-08-18 11:05:48,910 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for black hole entropy, known as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant and l_p is the Planck length

2) The entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon

3) The angular size θ is related to the actual size by the distance d:
   θ = actual size / distance

4) Rearranging this: actual size = θ * d

5) We're given:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

6) Convert degrees to ra...
