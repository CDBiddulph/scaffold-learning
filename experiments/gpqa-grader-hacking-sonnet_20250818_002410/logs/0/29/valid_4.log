We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:30,597 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the initial decay probability
• The initial probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%

2) Consider the time already passed
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay
• This means the atom has survived the first 50 minutes

3) Calculate the remaining time for observation
• We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
• This means the total time period is now 200 minutes (50 + 150)

4) Use conditional probability rea...
