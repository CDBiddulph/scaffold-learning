Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:57,023 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, note the key forces involved:
   • Attractive force: Gravitational force
   • Repulsive force: Electrostatic force

2) For gravitational force, the strength is proportional to 1/r²
   • Force = G * (m1 * m2) / r²

3) For electrostatic force, the strength is also proportional to 1/r²
   • Force = k * (q1 * q2) / r²

4) The question implies comparing these two forces at r = 137 meters

5) The ratio will depend on how the smallest fundamental charges and ma...
