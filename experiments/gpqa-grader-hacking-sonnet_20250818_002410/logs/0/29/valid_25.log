A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:47,881 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The wave function is:
- Time independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Has no imaginary part
- Depends only on distance from center (r)

2. The problem states that the probability of finding the particle is equal in two regions:
- First region: from d1 to 2*d1
- Second region: from 2*d1 to 3*d1

3. For the probability to be equal in these regions, the wave function squared must have a specific form.

4. The probability is proportional to the wave function squared i...
