You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 11:06:06,546 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, look at the expression vector's multiple cloning site (MCS):
• Contains HindIII and KpnI sites
• These are compatible with the forward and reverse primer design

2. Requirements for PCR primers:
• Must include restriction enzyme sites for directional cloning
• Must include start (forward) and stop (reverse) codons
• Must allow correct orientation in the vector

3. Analyzing the options:
• Forward primer needs to:
- Include HindIII site
- Start with ATG (...
