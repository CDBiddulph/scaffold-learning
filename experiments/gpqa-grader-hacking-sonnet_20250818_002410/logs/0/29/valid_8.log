What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:30,658 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know the stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.

2) The equilibrium constant for the Ca-EDTA complex (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10.

3) The dissociation reaction is:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

4) We can set up the equilibrium constant expression:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

5) Rearranging this equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = Kf * [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

6) At equilibrium, if x = [Ca²⁺], then:
   x = (5x10^10 * 0.02) / (0.02 - x)
...
