An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25

2025-08-18 11:05:49,986 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin along y is calculated as ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ^† σ_y ψ

2) The state vector is (3i, 4)

3) First, let's compute σ_y * ψ:
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3i \end{pmatrix}

4) Now, compute the inner product with ψ^†:
   (3i, 4) * \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3i \end{pmatrix}

5) Let's compute this:
   = 3i(-4i) + 4(3i)
   = 12 + 12i
   = 12(1 + ...
