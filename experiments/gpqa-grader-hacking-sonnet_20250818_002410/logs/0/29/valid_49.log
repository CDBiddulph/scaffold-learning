bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:06:08,277 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV:
   • This suggests a photochemical reaction
   • The molecular weight remains the same
   • This likely indicates a photochemical rearrangement or ring opening/closing

2) The product is then reduced with H2/Pd:
   • This means hydrogen is added to the molecule
   • The reduction will add hydrogen to any unsaturated sites

3) The key question is about the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen i...
