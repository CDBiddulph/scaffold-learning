Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

2025-08-18 11:05:32,124 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * Σ(2ℓ+1) * sin(δℓ)

2) Here, k is the wave number, which we'll need to calculate first
   • Energy is 50 MeV
   • We can use the relativistic relation: k = √(2mE/ℏ²)

3) We're given phase shifts for different angular momenta:
   • ℓ=0: δ0 = 90°
   • ℓ=1: δ1 = 67°
   • ℓ=2: δ2 = 55°
   • ℓ=3: δ3 = 30°
   • ℓ=4: δ4 = 13°

4) Calculating each term:
   • (2*0+1) * s...
