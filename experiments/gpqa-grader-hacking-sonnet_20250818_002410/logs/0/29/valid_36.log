Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:56,909 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the context:
• Satellites are detecting astronomical objects
• Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
• Distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Consider the scale of localization precision:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular measurement
• This suggests the objects are quite far away

3. Evaluate the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
   - These are extremely large cosmic...
