Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-18 11:05:49,089 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and distance:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log(distance in parsecs) - 5

2) For the single star options:
   a) 7 mag at 50 parsecs
   b) 7 mag at 20 parsecs
   d) Absolute Vmag = 7 at 10 parsecs

3) For the two-star systems:
   c) Apparent Vmags of 7 and 8 at 5 parsecs
   e) Absolute Vmags of 7 and 8 at 10 parsecs
   f) Absolute Vmags of 7 and 7 at 10 parsecs

4) Fo...
