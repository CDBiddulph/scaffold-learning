2025-08-18 11:05:38,975 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT stands for:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory

2. Now, let's consider each symmetry:

• Lorentz Symmetry (1):
- This is fundamental to all relativistic quantum field theories
- Describes how physics looks the same in different reference frames
- MUST be respected in SMEFT

• Poincare Symmetry (2):
- Combines Lorentz symmetry with translations in spacetime
- Also fundamental to relativistic theories
- MUST be resp...
