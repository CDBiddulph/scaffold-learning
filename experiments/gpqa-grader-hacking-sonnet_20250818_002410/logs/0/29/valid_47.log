For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:06:07,671 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what Oblique Parameters are:
• These are parameters that describe quantum corrections to electroweak precision measurements
• They help constrain potential new physics beyond the Standard Model

2. Breit-Wigner corrections:
• These are corrections related to resonance properties
• In multi-Higgs-doublet models, these corrections can modify the standard oblique parameters

3. Considerations:
• The effectiveness of the correction depends o...
