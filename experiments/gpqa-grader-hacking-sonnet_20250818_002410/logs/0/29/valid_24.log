Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:48,481 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²), which determines time dilation.

2) For each particle, calculate the distance traveled in 1e-5s:
• Distance = speed × time

3) Zeta (0.96c):
• Distance = 0.96c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × 3 × 10⁸ × 1e-5 = 2880m

4) Eta (0.9c):
• Distance = 0.9c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × 3 × 10⁸ × 1e-5 = 2700m

5) Chi (0.88c):
• Distance = 0.88c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × 3 × 10⁸ × 1e-5 = 2640m

6) Lambda (0.93c):
• Distance = 0.93c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × 3 × 10⁸ ×...
