A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 11:06:06,551 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the problem setup:
   - A light beam is traveling through a glass with refractive index n
   - The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam
   - The speed of light in vacuum is c = 1

2) This scenario is similar to the Fizeau experiment, which deals with light moving through a moving medium.

3) The relativistic velocity addition formula is key here. For light propagating through a moving medium, the formula is:

   u'...
