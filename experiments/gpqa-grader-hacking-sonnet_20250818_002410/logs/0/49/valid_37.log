Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:27,264 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- The smallest attainable charge is the elementary charge (e)
- There are two fundamental forces in play: electromagnetic attraction/repulsion
- This seems to reference the fundamental electromagnetic interaction between charged particles

2. Key Considerations:
- Electromagnetic forces are governed by two key principles:
   a) Coulomb's Law (repulsive/attractive electrostatic force)
   b) Gravitational force between masses

3. Analysis:
- Coulomb's Law states: F = k(q1*q2)/r^2
- Gravitational force follows: F = G(m1*m2)/r^2
- Similar inverse square relationship

4. Specific Problem Insights:
- Distance is 137 meters
- Smallest charge suggests elementary charge
- Interesting ratio requested between forces

5. Crucial Observation:
- The ratio specifically references 137
- This suggests 1/137^2 relationship

6. Checking Options:
- Option C: 1/137^2 matches the expected pattern
- This looks like the Sommerfeld fine structure constant (α ≈ 1/137)

7. Verification:
- The fine structure constant represents fundamental electromagnetic coupling strength
- Precisely matches the problem's numerical setup
