We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 11:21:26,015 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- Redox potential depends on the concentrations of oxidized and reduced species
- Nernst equation relates standard reduction potential to actual conditions
- Complex formation can affect ion concentrations

2. Nernst Equation:
E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])
Where:
- E0 = 0.77 V
- R = gas constant
- T = temperature
- n = number of electrons transferred
- F = Faraday constant

3. Complex Formation Analysis:
- Formation of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex will reduce free Fe(III) concentration
- Complex formation constant is very high (10^21)
- This suggests significant complex formation

4. Calculations:
The complex formation significantly reduces free Fe(III) concentration
This will shift the redox potential toward a more negative value

5. Estimate Potential:
Compared to standard potential of 0.77 V, the potential will decrease due to complex formation

6. Evaluate Choices:
Looking at the options, +0.26 V seems most reasonable given the complex formation effect
