2025-08-18 11:21:19,561 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- Apparent magnitude depends on both absolute magnitude and distance
- For multiple stars, total brightness is calculated by adding their individual brightnesses
- Distance affects apparent magnitude via the distance modulus equation

2. Brightness Calculation:
- Apparent magnitude depends on: m = M + 5 log(d/10)
   Where m = apparent magnitude, M = absolute magnitude, d = distance in parsecs

3. Systematic Evaluation:
a) 7 mag at 50 parsecs - Will be dimmer due to large distance
b) 7 mag at 20 parsecs - Closer, will appear brighter
c) Two stars at 5 parsecs with V=7 and V=8
   - Closer distance helps brightness
   - Need to calculate combined magnitude
d) Absolute magnitude 7 at 10 parsecs - By definition, this would be at its standard reference point
e) Two stars with Vmag 7 and 8 at 10 parsecs
f) Two stars with Vmag 7 and 7 at 10 parsecs

4. Detailed Calculations:
- Option c: Close distance and multiple stars gives best chance
- Combined magnitude = -2.5 log(10^(-7/2.5) + 10^(-8/2.5))
- This indicates significant combined brightness

5. Reasoning:
The closest stars at 5 parsecs with significant combined brightness will appear brightest.
