We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:20:59,605 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- This is a radioactive decay problem
- The decay follows an exponential probability distribution
- Probability of decay depends on time passed and total decay probability

2. Key Information:
- Total decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%
- 50 minutes have already passed
- We want to know decay probability in next 150 minutes

3. Reasoning:
- Decay follows exponential decay law
- Probability of decay = 1 - e^(-λt)
- λ can be calculated from initial condition
- We know P(100 min) = 32%
- So, e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32
- λ = -ln(0.68)/100 = 0.00332 per minute

4. Calculation:
- 50 minutes have passed with no decay
- This means we're now "starting" from 50 minutes
- Remaining decay probability = 1 - e^(-λ*(150))
- Plugging in values: 1 - e^(-0.00332 * 150)
- This calculates to approximately 0.44 or 44%

5. Evaluation:
- This matches option B, 44%
