Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:17,645 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction with bromine
- The yield of para-isomer depends on the substituent's directing effect
- Substituents are classified as:
   * Activating ortho/para directors
   * Deactivating meta directors
   * Neutral substituents

2. Substituent Analysis:
1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Strong activating, strongly favors para product
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weakly deactivating, meta-directing
3) C6H5-Cl (chloro): Weakly deactivating, para-directing
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitro): Strong deactivating, meta-directing
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl): Activating, favors para product
6) C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing

3. Ranking by Para-Isomer Weight Fraction (increasing order):
- NO2 (lowest para yield)
- COOH/COOC2H5 (meta-directors)
- Cl
- CH3/C2H5 (highest para yield)

4. Final Order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5

5. Matching Answer: Option C matches this order
