Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4

2025-08-18 11:21:08,652 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Principles involved:
- Equilibrium temperature is related to orbital distance and stellar irradiance
- Orbital period is related to orbital radius
- Mass can influence orbital dynamics
- Albedo affects temperature calculation

2. Relationship equations:
- Equilibrium temperature (T) ∝ (1/orbital radius)^0.5
- Orbital period (P) ∝ orbital radius^1.5

3. Analysis of given data:
- Temperature ratio (Planet1/Planet2) = 1.4
- Temperature ratio (Planet2/Planet3) = 2.3
- Mass ratio (Planet1/Planet2) = 1.15
- Mass ratio (Planet2/Planet3) = 1.35
- Albedo = 0.3 for all planets (constant)

4. Orbital period calculation:
- From temperature ratios, we can infer orbital radius ratios
- (r2/r1)^0.5 = 1/1.4
- (r3/r2)^0.5 = 1/2.3

5. Calculating orbital period ratio:
- (P3/P1) = (r3/r1)^1.5
- (r3/r1) = (r3/r2) * (r2/r1)
- This suggests a ratio close to 10.4
