Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:20:59,796 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Relevant Scientific Principles:
- Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope
- Gamma-ray emission depends on radioactive decay
- Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
- Detector size and distance matter for gamma-ray detection

2. Key Calculations:
- Total number of atoms: 10^17
- Decay constant (λ) is related to half-life
- Detector area: 2 cm × 3 cm = 6 cm²
- Distance: 4 meters = 400 cm
- Time elapsed: 80 minutes

3. Gamma Ray Emission Estimation:
- Each radioactive decay emits a gamma ray
- Solid angle at 4m distance reduces detection
- Approximate solid angle: (6 cm²) / (4m × 4m × 4π) ≈ 10^-6
- Total possible gamma rays ≈ 10^17 × decay fraction
- 80 minutes is a small fraction of half-life

4. Rough Calculation:
- Estimated detected gamma rays: 10^17 × 10^-6 ≈ 10^6

5. Comparing Choices:
- This matches choice C: 1 million (10^6)
