2025-08-18 11:20:58,767 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles
- This is an equilibrium problem involving a metal-EDTA complex
- We need to calculate the free calcium ion concentration
- The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is crucial for this calculation

2. Equilibrium Relationship
- Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻
- KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]
- Given: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, KCa-EDTA = 5 × 10¹⁰

3. Calculation
- Rearrange the equation: [Ca²⁺] = KCa-EDTA × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]
- Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry and complete dissociation
- [Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10¹⁰) × 0.02 / 1
- [Ca²⁺] = 1.0 × 10⁻² M

4. Evaluate Choices
- This matches option A: 1.0 × 10⁻² M
