bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

2025-08-18 11:21:35,617 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the starting material: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
- This is a bicyclic ketone with a rigid ring structure
- Symmetric structure with a ketone group

2. UV Irradiation → Product 1
- UV radiation likely causes a photochemical reaction
- Since molecular weight remains the same, likely a rearrangement or bond reorganization
- Potentially forms a photodimer or photoisomer

3. Pd/C + H2 → Product 2
- This suggests hydrogenation or reduction
- Palladium on carbon is a classic catalyst for hydrogen addition
- Likely reduces the ketone to an alcohol

4. NMR Considerations
- The most deshielded hydrogen is likely near the former ketone group
- After reduction, this hydrogen would be on a carbon adjacent to the newly formed alcohol
- The local molecular environment will determine its splitting pattern

5. Splitting Pattern Analysis
- The hydrogen's environment suggests coupling with neighboring hydrogens
- Most likely a doublet due to coupling with a single adjacent hydrogen

6. Reasoning suggests the most deshielded hydrogen would show a doublet splitting pattern
