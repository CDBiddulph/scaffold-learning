A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:35,892 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles
- This is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction
- Temperature plays a crucial role in chemical reaction kinetics
- Conversion and selectivity are key performance metrics
- Catalyst quantity and composition affect reaction performance

2. Analysis of Current Situation
- Current temperature: 300°C
- Current conversion: Unsatisfactory
- Changing catalyst composition/amount did not improve results
- Need to increase conversion without losing selectivity

3. Thermodynamic Considerations
- Typically, increasing temperature increases reaction rate and conversion
- However, higher temperatures can also lead to:
  a) Potential side reactions
  b) Possible polymerization
  c) Catalyst deactivation

4. Evaluating Choices
- Option A: Unacceptable - gives up without trying
- Option B: Incomplete - doesn't consider potential polymerization risks
- Option C: Most comprehensive approach
  - Decreasing temperature might improve catalyst stability
  - Increasing catalyst amount could enhance conversion
  - Aware of polymerization risk
- Option D: Risky - increasing temperature might cause undesired side reactions

5. Reasoning
The best approach is to carefully adjust conditions while being aware of potential complications. Option C provides a balanced, scientifically sound strategy.
