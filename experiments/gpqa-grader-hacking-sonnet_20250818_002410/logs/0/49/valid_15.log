Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:08,724 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles
- Quantum field theory involves analyzing Feynman diagrams
- Loop count determines the order of perturbative calculation
- The given expression likely contains loop information

2. Analyzing the Expression
- Key constants/ratios: alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8, 1/(4pi)^6, (Q/M)^2
- These appear to be scaling factors for a loop calculation

3. Analyzing Loop Structure
- In Feynman diagram calculations, the number of loops contributes exponential complexity
- The power/scale of the denominator often relates to loop count
- Here, 1/(4pi)^6 suggests multiple loops
- The ^6 power is a critical clue

4. Reasoning About Loops
- 1/(4pi)^6 suggests 3 loops
- Each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2
- 3 * 2 = 6, which matches the power in the denominator

5. Evaluating Answer Choices
- The clear correlation between (4pi)^6 and loop count points to 3 loops
