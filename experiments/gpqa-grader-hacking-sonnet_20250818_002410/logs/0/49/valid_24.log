Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:16,795 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- Time dilation affects particle lifetime
- Distance traveled depends on particle speed
- Relativistic effects become significant at high speeds

2. Calculate distance traveled for each particle:
- Zeta: 0.96c * (1e-5) = 0.96 * 3e5 * (1e-5) = 28.8 km
- Eta: 0.9c * (1e-5) = 0.9 * 3e5 * (1e-5) = 27 km
- Chi: 0.88c * (1e-5) = 0.88 * 3e5 * (1e-5) = 26.4 km
- Lambda: 0.93c * (1e-5) = 0.93 * 3e5 * (1e-5) = 27.9 km

3. Comparison:
- Zeta: 28.8 km > Lambda: 27.9 km > Eta: 27 km > Chi: 26.4 km

4. Verify against ground level (13 km):
- All particles can reach ground level

5. Order of particles reaching ground:
Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi

This matches option B.
