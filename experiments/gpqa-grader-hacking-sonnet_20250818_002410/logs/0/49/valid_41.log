2025-08-18 11:21:35,295 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- Color of light is related to its energy
- Complementary colors are absorbed and emitted by molecules
- Energy of light is inversely related to wavelength

2. Equations/Relationships:
- Energy (E) = h * f (Planck's equation)
- Energy is given as 2.3393 eV
- Color depends on wavelength/energy range

3. Color Energy Analysis:
- Visible spectrum ranges from ~1.7 to 3.3 eV
- Blue light is around 2.4-2.7 eV
- Violet light is around 3.1-3.3 eV
- Red light is around 1.7-2.0 eV
- Yellow light is around 2.0-2.3 eV

4. Absorption Logic:
- If a molecule emits 2.3393 eV, it will absorb the complementary color
- 2.3393 eV is closest to the yellow light energy range
- Complementary color to yellow is violet/blue

5. Selection:
- Violet is the complementary color that best matches this energy
