You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 11:21:36,464 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the requirements:
- Need to clone the sequence directionally into the expression vector
- Use two different restriction enzymes
- Check the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the vector: SmaI-HindIII-BglII-KpnI-PstI-BamHI-EcoRI

2. Key considerations:
- Forward primer needs an enzyme site at 5' end
- Reverse primer needs a different enzyme site at 5' end
- Must preserve the original reading frame of the gene

3. Examine the enzyme options against the MCS:
- HindIII is in the MCS
- KpnI is in the MCS
- BamHI is in the MCS

4. Check each option:
A) HindIII at 5' end, KpnI at 3' end ✓
B) HindIII at 5' end, BamHI at 3' end ✓
C) SmaI at 5' end, BamHI at 3' end
D) BamHI at 5' end, HindIII at 3' end (incorrect orientation)

5. Final verification:
Option A looks correct - different enzymes, correct orientation

Answer: A

Reasoning:
- Primer 1 starts with HindIII site (aaaaaagctt)
- Primer 2 starts with KpnI site (aaaggtacc)
- These allow directional cloning
- Preserves original gene sequence
- Uses two different restriction sites present in the vector's MCS
