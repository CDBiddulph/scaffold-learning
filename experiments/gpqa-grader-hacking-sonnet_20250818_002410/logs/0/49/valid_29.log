Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 11:21:17,897 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Principles to consider:
- Optically active compounds must have a chiral center
- Requires an asymmetric carbon with 4 different substituents
- Needs to be a saturated hydrocarbon (only single bonds)

2. Key requirements:
- Molecular formula must match hydrocarbon composition
- Structure must have an asymmetric carbon
- Consistent with mass spectrometry fragmentation pattern

3. Analysis of each option:
A) C6H12 (molecular weight 84)
   - No obvious chiral center
   - Not optically active

B) C7H14 (molecular weight 98)
   - Possible structural isomers
   - Could have a chiral carbon if branched

C) C4H8 (molecular weight 56)
   - Too small to have chiral complexity
   - Not optically active

D) C8H16 (molecular weight 112)
   - Larger molecule
   - Higher probability of branching
   - More likely to have chiral center

4. Detailed evaluation:
Option D provides the best opportunity for creating an asymmetric carbon through branching, which would make the molecule optically active.

5. Final reasoning:
The molecular structure implied by option D has the highest likelihood of containing a chiral center.
