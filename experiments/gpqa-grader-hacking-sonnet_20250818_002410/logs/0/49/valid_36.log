Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:26,476 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key information:
- Satellites detecting astronomical objects
- Localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes
- Isotropic distribution of objects
- Need to determine possible distances from the Sun

2. Scientific principles to consider:
- Arc minutes relate to angular resolution
- Distance affects detectability of astronomical objects
- Localization precision suggests these are likely astronomical scale observations

3. Evaluating distances:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years: These are intergalactic distances, far beyond typical satellite observation range
B) 1,000 or 100,000 light years: These are within the Milky Way galaxy, reasonable for satellite detection
C) 10 or 100 light years: Too close, within our solar neighborhood
D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds: Far too small, within solar system scale

4. Key reasoning:
- The precision of 100-200 arc minutes suggests observations of objects beyond our immediate solar system
- The isotropic distribution indicates objects spread across a significant volume of space
- This points to galactic or near-galactic scale distances

5. Conclusion:
The most appropriate distance range is within the Milky Way galaxy.
