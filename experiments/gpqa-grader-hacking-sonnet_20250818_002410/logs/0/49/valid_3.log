2025-08-18 11:20:59,451 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- Density is defined as mass divided by volume
- For planets of similar composition, density changes with mass and radius
- Gravitational compression increases with planet mass

2. Analysis of each option:
a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
- This would have standard Earth density (5.5 g/cm³)
- No compression effects

b) 2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ density
- Suggests minimal gravitational compression
- Relatively simple case

c) Earth composition, 5x Earth mass
- Gravitational compression would significantly increase density
- Higher mass leads to more compact internal structure
- Increased compression would raise density above baseline

d) Earth composition, 0.5x Earth mass
- Lower mass means less gravitational compression
- Density likely lower than standard Earth density

3. Key Insight:
- As planet mass increases, gravitational compression increases
- This causes internal compression and higher effective density
- Larger masses compact material more tightly

4. Conclusion:
The planet with 5x Earth's mass (option c) would have the highest density due to significant gravitational compression.
