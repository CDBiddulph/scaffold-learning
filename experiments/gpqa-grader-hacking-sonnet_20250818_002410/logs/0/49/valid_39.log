ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:27,641 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key Scientific Principles:
- ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing) maps protein-DNA interactions
- Crosslinking fixation methods can affect protein-DNA interaction detection
- IKAROS is a key transcription factor in B cell development and regulation
- Peak disappearance suggests differential protein-DNA interaction stability

2. Fixation Method Considerations:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) alone provides looser crosslinking
- PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) provides more rigid, extensive crosslinking
- More rigid crosslinking can disrupt transient or weak protein-DNA interactions

3. Reasoning about Peak Location:
- Transient interactions are most common at:
  * Active regulatory elements
  * Dynamic transcriptional sites
  * Promoters and enhancers during active gene regulation

4. Evaluating Choices:
- Random locations (A) - Unlikely, suggests systematic binding
- Repeats (B) - Generally less dynamic
- Introns (C) - Less likely site of dynamic interaction
- Active promoters/enhancers (D) - Most likely site of transient interactions

5. Conclusion:
The peaks most likely to disappear with stricter crosslinking are at active promoters and enhancers, where transcription factor binding is most dynamic.
