A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:17,681 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- This is a quantum mechanics problem involving wave functions
- The wave function is:
   * Time-independent
   * Spherically symmetric
   * Has no imaginary part
   * Related to probability distribution

2. Key Information:
- Probability between d1 and 2*d1 is P
- Probability between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P
- r is the distance from the center

3. Probability Analysis:
- For probability to be constant in concentric shell regions of different widths, the wave function must decrease in a way that compensates for increasing shell volume

4. Volume Considerations:
- Volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r²
- If wave function is ψ(r), probability ∝ r² * |ψ(r)|²

5. Required Wave Function Property:
- For constant probability, |ψ(r)|² must be proportional to 1/r²
- This means ψ(r) must be proportional to 1/r

6. Checking Options:
- 1/r is the wave function that satisfies the described conditions
