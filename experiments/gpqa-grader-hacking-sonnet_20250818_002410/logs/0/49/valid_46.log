2025-08-18 11:21:35,497 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law:

1. Identify scientific principles:
- Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature
- Stefan-Boltzmann law relates luminosity to temperature and radius

2. Calculate star's temperature from peak photon energy:
- Peak energy for star A: 7.21 eV
- Peak energy for sun: 1.41 eV
- Temperature is proportional to peak energy
- T_A/T_sun = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

3. Use Stefan-Boltzmann law relationship:
- Luminosity L ∝ R²T⁴
- Given L_A = 24 * L_sun
- (R_A/R_sun)² * (T_A/T_sun)⁴ = 24

4. Solve for radius:
- (R_A/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴ = 24
- (R_A/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
- R_A/R_sun = sqrt(24 / (5.11)⁴)
- R_A/R_sun ≈ 0.19

5. Check answer choices:
The calculated value of 0.19 matches option B.
