There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 11:20:58,741 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the C-NOT gate principles:
- A C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate applies a NOT operation on the target qubit only if the control qubit is |1⟩
- In this case, the condition is the control qubit must be |0⟩

2. Analyze the input state:
\left|\psi\right\rangle = \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

3. Determine gate action:
- The control qubit is |0⟩
- With a |0⟩ control, NO bit flip occurs on the target qubit
- Therefore, the target qubit remains |0⟩

4. Evaluate answer choices:
- Option A shows NO change to the original state
- This matches the C-NOT gate behavior when control is |0⟩

5. Verify the reasoning:
- α|0⟩ remains unchanged
- β|1⟩ and -γ|1⟩ remain unchanged
- Target qubit stays |0⟩
