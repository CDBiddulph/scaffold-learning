Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:21:08,452 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- Coulomb's law for electrostatic potential energy
- Spatial configuration of charges
- Energy minimization

2. Key Information:
- 13 total charges: 12 at radius 2m, 1 at center
- Each charge is 2e
- We want minimum system energy

3. Energy Calculation:
- Potential energy between a charge at center and each other charge:
U = kQ1Q2/r
- k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
- Q1 = Q2 = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C
- r = 2m

4. Calculation:
- Energy per pair = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2
- Energy for 12 pairs = 12 × [(8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2]
- Calculation yields 2.822 × 10^-26 J

5. Matching Choices:
This exactly matches option D.
