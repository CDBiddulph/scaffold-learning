S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 11:21:11,392 [INFO] Extracted question (first 200 chars): S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

2025-08-18 11:21:17,411 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First reaction: TBS protection
- S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is protected with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride
- This protects the hydroxyl group, preventing side reactions
- Forms product 1 with silyl ether protection

2. Second reaction: Organocopper coupling
- Ph2CuLi (organocuprate) adds phenyl group
- Low temperature ensures regioselective addition
- Benzyl bromide then adds benzyl group
- Forms product 2 with phenyl and benzyl substituents

3. Third reaction: Alkylation
- LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) deprotonates
- Iodomethane adds methyl group
- Forms product 3 with additional methyl group

4. Final reaction: Deprotection
- Aqueous HCl removes silyl protecting group
- Restores hydroxyl group
- Likely retains stereochemistry from previous steps

5. Analyzing the structure:
- Has hydroxyl group
- Cyclohexanone backbone
- Benzyl substituent
- Methyl substituent
- Phenyl substituent

Comparing to the options, the stereochemistry matches option C.
