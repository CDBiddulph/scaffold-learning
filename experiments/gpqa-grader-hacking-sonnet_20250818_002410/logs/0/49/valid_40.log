A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 11:21:35,444 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- This problem involves light propagation through a moving medium
- We need to consider the relativistic effect of relative motion
- The problem involves the speed of light in a moving reference frame

2. Equation Considerations:
- In classical physics, we would simply add velocities
- However, this scenario requires relativistic velocity addition
- The relativistic velocity addition formula is: 
  v_observed = (v_light + v_medium) / (1 + v_light * v_medium / cÂ²)

3. Given Conditions:
- Speed of light in vacuum, c = 1
- Refractive index of glass = n
- Glass velocity = v
- Direction is toward the observer

4. Velocity Transformation:
- Speed of light in glass = c/n
- Applying relativistic velocity addition formula
- Simplified form: (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n * v)/c)
- Substituting c = 1: (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n))

5. Evaluating Answer Choices:
- Choice (D) matches this derived formula: (1 + n*v)/(n + v)
