2025-08-18 11:21:17,114 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Scientific Principles:
- Black hole entropy is related to its surface area
- The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = kA/4l_p²
- Angular size relates to physical size and distance

2. Key Relationships:
- θ = physical size of event horizon / distance
- Physical size of event horizon = 2GM/c²
- Where G = gravitational constant, M = black hole mass, c = speed of light

3. Calculations:
- Given θ = 10^-17 degrees
- Event horizon radius = θ * d * (π/180°)
- Radius = 10^-17 * 10^10 * (π/180°) parsecs
- 1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters

4. Entropy Estimation:
- S = (c³/4G) * (Area of event horizon)
- Area proportional to radius squared
- Entropy will be around 10^66 J/K scale

5. Evaluating Choices:
- Choice B matches the order of magnitude we calculated
