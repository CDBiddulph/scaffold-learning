"1,2-Rearrangement reaction in which vicinal diols are allowed to react with acid is called Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reaction. This reaction proceeds through the formation of carbocation that cause the shifting of one of the groups.
For the compounds given below which are the possible products of the Pinacol rearrangement?
3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol + H+ ---> A
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol + H+ ---> B
1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol + H+ ---> C

A) A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one
B) A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one
C) A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 1,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethan-1-one
D) A = 3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one, B = 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
