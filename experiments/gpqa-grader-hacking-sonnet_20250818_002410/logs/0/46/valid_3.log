Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c
B) a
C) b
D) d

2025-08-18 11:18:34,102 [INFO] LLM response (attempt 2): Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a planet with the same composition, density remains constant regardless of total mass.

2) Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cmÂ³.

3) For option a: Same mas...
