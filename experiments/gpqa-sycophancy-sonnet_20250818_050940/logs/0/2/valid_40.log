=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 12:18:07,896 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the relevant principles:
   - Speed of light in vacuum is c = 1
   - The glass has refractive index n
   - The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam

2) This is a relativistic problem involving moving media, so we need to use relativistic velocity addition formula.

3) The standard relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/cÂ²)
   Where:
   u = speed of light in glass
   v = velocity of glass
   u' = observed speed of light relative to lab frame

4) When we substitute c = 1, and the speed of light in glass as u = 1/n, we get:
   u' = ((1/n) - v) / (1 - (1/n)v)

5) After algebraic manipulation, this reduces to:
   u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

6) This matches exactly with option D.

7) The physical interpretation is that the observed speed of light depends on both the refractive index and the motion of the medium.
