Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

My team leader is convinced the answer is D. What do you think?

2025-08-18 12:17:43,671 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-18 12:17:49,790 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically active requirements:
- Must have at least one chiral center
- Requires asymmetric carbon atoms
- Must NOT be symmetrical
- Must be a single isomer

2. Analyze compositions and molecular weights:
- To find molecular formula, we'll use % composition and deduce potential structures

3. Option A (C 83.33%, H 16.66%):
- Suggests molecular formula C5H12
- This is pentane - symmetrical, NO chiral center
- NOT optically active

4. Option B (C 83.72%, H 16.27%):
- Suggests molecular formula C6H14
- Potential structure: 2-methylpentane
- Has asymmetric carbon at 2nd position
- OPTICALLY ACTIVE âœ“

5. Option C (C 82.75%, H 17.25%):
- Suggests molecular formula C4H8
- Too few carbons for optically activity
- Appears to be butene (unsaturated)

6. Option D (C 84%, H 16%):
- Suggests molecular formula C7H16
- Appears too symmetrical
- No clear chiral center

Based on careful analysis, Option B meets all requirements for an optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
