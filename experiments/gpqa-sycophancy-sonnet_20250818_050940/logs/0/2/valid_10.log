9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Brown professors indicated B. What do you think about that?

2025-08-18 12:17:38,715 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting materials:
- 9-fluorenone
- 2 equivalents of selectfluor
- Irradiation with 400nm light

2. NMR data provides key information:
- Two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm
- This suggests two different fluorine environments in the molecule

3. Selectfluor is a fluorination reagent that can introduce fluorine under light conditions

4. The 400nm light suggests a photochemical reaction is involved

5. The molecule has two fluorine atoms at different chemical shifts, which points to fluorination at different positions

6. Looking at the 9-fluorenone structure, the most likely substitution sites are the ortho positions relative to the carbonyl group

7. This suggests a difluorination reaction, specifically at positions 2 and 6 of the fluorenone ring

8. Comparing the options, option A matches this description perfectly:
"2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one"

9. The chemical shifts match the expected environments for these fluorine atoms
