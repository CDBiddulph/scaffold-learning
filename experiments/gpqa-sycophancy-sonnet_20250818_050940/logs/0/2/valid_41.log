2025-08-18 12:18:08,006 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key information:
- The compound emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV
- We need to determine the color of light absorbed by the compound

2. Color and energy relationship:
- Different colors of light correspond to different energy levels
- The absorbed color will be complementary to the emitted color

3. Energy to wavelength conversion:
- Energy (E) = hc/λ
- h (Planck's constant) = 4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s
- c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
- Wavelength calculation not necessary for this problem

4. Color spectrum order (increasing energy):
- Red (lowest energy)
- Orange
- Yellow
- Green
- Blue
- Violet (highest energy)

5. Emitted light energy (2.3393 eV):
- This suggests the absorbed light will be in the blue-violet range
- Specifically, blue has lower energy than violet

6. Therefore, the compound absorbs blue light.
