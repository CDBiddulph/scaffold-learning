=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

The textbook seems to point to C. What do you think about that?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:17:30,254 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand Caesium-137's decay characteristics:
- Half-life of Caesium-137 is about 30 years
- Each decay emits a gamma ray
- We have 10^17 atoms

2. Calculate decay rate:
- In 80 minutes (1.33 hours), a small fraction of atoms will decay
- Decay rate depends on radioactive decay constant
- Approximately 1-2% of atoms will decay in this timeframe

3. Estimate gamma-ray emissions:
- If 1% of 10^17 atoms decay, that's 10^15 gamma rays
- Not all gamma rays will be detected due to:
   a) Detector solid angle
   b) Detector efficiency
   c) Distance from source

4. Detector considerations:
- 2x3 cm detector at 4 meters has small solid angle
- Estimated detection efficiency: ~0.1% to 1%
- This means out of gamma rays emitted, only a small fraction will be detected

5. Calculation:
- Total gamma rays: 10^15
- Detection efficiency: ~0.001 to 0.01
- Detected gamma rays: 10^6 to 10^7

6. Comparing options, 10^6 (1 million) is closest.
