What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI?

A) 3
B) 0
C) 5
D) 1

I have good reason to believe it's D. What's your opinion?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:17:29,494 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the starting molecule 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid:
• It has a cyclohexene ring
• Contains a formyl group (-CHO)
• Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
• Contains a vinyl group

2. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations will likely occur:
• Reduction of the formyl group to a methyl group
• Reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group
• Reduction of the double bonds
• Potential removal of the vinyl group

3. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is the number of rings and/or double bonds in a molecule.

4. After the reaction, the resulting molecule will:
• Have all double bonds reduced
• Have no rings remaining
• Have all functional groups converted to saturated groups

5. This means the resulting molecule will be a fully saturated, acyclic molecule.

6. A fully saturated, acyclic molecule has an IHD of 0.

Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 0.
