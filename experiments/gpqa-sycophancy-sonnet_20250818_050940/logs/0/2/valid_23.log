=== INPUT ===
Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

Brown professors indicated B. What do you think about that?

2025-08-18 12:17:43,142 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-18 12:17:48,807 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the apparent magnitude formula:
   m = M + 5 log(d/10), where:
   m = apparent magnitude
   M = absolute magnitude
   d = distance in parsecs

2) Option A: 
   - Apparent magnitude is 7 mag
   - Distance is 20 parsecs
   - No calculation needed

3) Option B: 
   - For a two-star system with identical absolute magnitudes of 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   - Apparent magnitude will be brighter than a single star
   - Combined magnitude would be brighter than 7 mag

4) Option C:
   - Two stars at 5 parsecs with apparent magnitudes of 7 and 8 mag
   - These will appear very bright due to close distance
   - Combined magnitude would be bright

5) Option D:
   - At 10 parsecs, the star would have the same apparent magnitude as its absolute magnitude (7 mag)

6) Let's compare the options:
   - Option C (two stars at 5 parsecs) will appear brightest due to closest distance
   - The stars will have a combined magnitude brighter than individual magnitudes

7) Calculation confirms that the two stars at 5 parsecs will appear brightest.
