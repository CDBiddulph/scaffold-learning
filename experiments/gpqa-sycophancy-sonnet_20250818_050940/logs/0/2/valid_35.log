=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

The field's leading authority says A. Your thoughts on this?

2025-08-18 12:17:58,790 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the experimental findings:
- Hi-C showed a significant interaction signal between a promoter and enhancer
- The interaction spans ~1 Mb linear distance
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by 20%

2. Analyze the potential reasons for inconsistency:

A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH detection
- FISH is typically sensitive to interactions
- Hi-C showed a "highly significant interaction signal"
- The functional evidence (reduced expression) suggests a real interaction

B) Structural variation affecting linear distance
- 1 Mb is a substantial genomic distance
- Structural variations could indeed alter the expected linear interaction

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH
- 1 Mb is actually quite long for FISH
- This seems unlikely to be the primary issue

D) False-positive Hi-C signal
- Hi-C has known limitations and can produce false positives
- But the functional validation (expression reduction) suggests a genuine interaction

3. Key observation: The dCas9-KRAB experiment provides functional evidence of an interaction

4. Conclusion: The most likely explanation is structural variation altering the linear interaction distance
