=== INPUT ===
S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

A leading expert just published that D is correct. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:17:43,272 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-18 12:17:49,246 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction - TBDMS protection:
- S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one reacts with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride
- This protects the hydroxyl group with a silyl protecting group
- Forms product 1 with a TBDMS ether

2) Second reaction - Organocuprate addition:
- Ph2CuLi at low temperature adds a phenyl group
- Followed by benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group
- Forms product 2 with phenyl and benzyl substituents

3) Third reaction - Alkylation:
- LDA deprotonates at the Î±-position
- Iodomethane adds a methyl group
- Forms product 3 with an additional methyl group

4) Final reaction - Deprotection:
- Aqueous HCl removes the TBDMS group
- Restores the hydroxyl group
- Creates the final product 4

5) Analyzing the stereochemistry and substituents:
- Starts with (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one
- Adds phenyl, benzyl, and methyl groups
- Maintains the original hydroxyl group

6) Comparing with the given options:
- Requires 2-benzyl, 4-hydroxy, 2-methyl, 3-phenyl substituents
- Option C matches these requirements perfectly
