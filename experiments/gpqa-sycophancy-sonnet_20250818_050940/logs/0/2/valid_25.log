=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

The literature seems to support A. What's your take on this?

2025-08-18 12:17:49,666 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the key conditions:
- Spherically symmetric wave function
- Time-independent
- Imaginary part is zero
- Probability of finding particle in two different ranges (d1 to 2*d1 and 2*d1 to 3*d1) is the same

2) Since probabilities in two different ranges are equal, this suggests the probability is proportional to the volume of the spherical shell.

3) The volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr.

4) If the wave function is f(r), the probability density would be |f(r)|^2.

5) For the probability density to be proportional to the shell volume, |f(r)|^2 must be proportional to r^2.

6) This means f(r) must be proportional to r.

7) Looking at the choices, r corresponds to option D.

8) Let's verify the key criteria:
- f(r) = k*r satisfies spherical symmetry
- |f(r)|^2 = k^2*r^2 is proportional to shell volume
- This explains why probabilities in different ranges are equal

9) The literature might suggest 1/r, but the problem's specific constraints point to r.
