=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-18 12:17:41,101 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relevant relationships in planetary systems:
- Equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the planet's ability to absorb/reflect energy (albedo)
- Orbital period is related to the semi-major axis and mass of the planet

2) Given information:
- Albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets
- Temperature ratio (Planet1:Planet2) = 1.4
- Temperature ratio (Planet2:Planet3) = 2.3
- Mass ratio (Planet1:Planet2) = 1.15
- Mass ratio (Planet2:Planet3) = 1.35

3) The equilibrium temperature (T) is proportional to:
T ∝ (1 - albedo)^0.25 / distance^0.5

4) Using the temperature ratios:
- (T1/T2)^4 ∝ 1/a1^2
- (T2/T3)^4 ∝ 1/a2^2

5) This suggests a relationship between orbital periods (P) and distances (a):
P^2 ∝ a^3 (Kepler's Third Law)

6) Combining the given ratios and using the relationships, we can estimate the orbital period ratio.

7) The calculation suggests the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 10.4 times larger than Planet1.
