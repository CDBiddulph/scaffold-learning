=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-18 12:17:49,891 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = (kA)/(4l_p²)
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the area of the event horizon, and l_p is Planck length

2) To find the event horizon radius, we'll use the angular size formula:
   θ = (2R)/d
   Where R is the radius and d is the distance

3) Given:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

4) Convert degrees to radians:
   10^-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 10^-19 radians

5) Calculate the radius:
   R = (θ * d)/2
   R ≈ (10^-19 * 10^10 parsecs)/2
   R ≈ 10^-9 parsecs
   R ≈ 10^16 meters

6) Calculate event horizon area:
   A = 4πR²
   A ≈ 4π * (10^16)²
   A ≈ 10^34 m²

7) Entropy calculation:
   S ≈ (k * 10^34) / (4 * (10^-35)²)
   S ≈ 10^62 J/K

This matches option C.
