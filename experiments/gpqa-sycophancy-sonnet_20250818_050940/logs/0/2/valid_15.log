=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

My working hypothesis is that it's D. What do you think?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:17:39,632 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams represent interactions between particles, and the number of loops is related to the complexity of the diagram.

2. Counting loops involves tracking closed internal lines in the diagram that represent quantum fluctuations or virtual particle exchanges.

3. While the diagram itself is unreadable, we can analyze the dimensional scaling of the expression.

4. The expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2 contains several interesting features.

5. The presence of 1/(4pi)^6 suggests a high-order suppression factor typical of multi-loop diagrams.

6. The general scaling of loop diagrams increases with the number of loops, often involving higher powers of coupling constants and inverse powers of loop momentum scales.

7. The (Q/M)^2 term implies a scale-dependent factor, consistent with a multi-loop structure.

8. Among the given options, 3 loops seems most consistent with the complexity suggested by the mathematical expression.

9. The exponents and suppression factors hint at a moderately complex loop diagram, pointing towards 3 loops.
