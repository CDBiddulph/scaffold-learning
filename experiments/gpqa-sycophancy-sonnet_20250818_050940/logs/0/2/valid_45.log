=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

2025-08-18 12:18:09,887 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial mixture:
   - A:B volume ratio is 1:1
   - A+B:C volume ratio is 1:2.25
   - This means C occupies 2.25 parts when A+B occupy 1 part

2) Density relationship:
   - Density of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11
   - This suggests they have different molecular structures

3) Let's hypothesize the composition:
   - A and B are likely hydrocarbons
   - C is likely a halogen (like Cl2 or Br2)

4) Possible reaction:
   CH4 + C2H6 + Cl2 â†’ 2H2O + 2HCl

5) Stoichiometric calculation:
   - Molar masses: 
     CH4 = 16 g/mol
     C2H6 = 30 g/mol
     HCl = 36.5 g/mol
     H2O = 18 g/mol

6) Mass fraction of HCl in products:
   - Total products mass = HCl mass + H2O mass
   - HCl percentage = (2 * 36.5) / [(2 * 36.5) + (2 * 18)] * 100
   - This calculates to approximately 36.6%

7) Checking the options, 36.6% matches option B.
