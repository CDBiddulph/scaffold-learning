2025-08-18 12:17:33,305 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

   $Im(f(0)) = \frac{k}{2} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$

2) We are given the phase shifts for $l = 0$ to $l = 4$:
   $\delta_0 = 90°$
   $\delta_1 = 67°$
   $\delta_2 = 55°$
   $\delta_3 = 30°$
   $\delta_4 = 13°$

3) Calculate $\sin(2\delta_l)$ for each phase shift:
   $\sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180°) = 0$
   $\sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134°) = 0.669$
   $\sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110°) = 0.940$
   $\sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60°) = 0.866$
   $\sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26°) = 0.438$

4) Compute the wave number $k$ for 50 MeV electrons.
   $k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar = 154.2$ fm^-1

5) Compute the sum term:
   $(2(0)+1) \sin(2\delta_0) = 1(0) = 0$
   $(2(1)+1) \sin(2\delta_1) = 3(0.669) = 2.007$
   $(2(2)+1) \sin(2\delta_2) = 5(0.940) = 4.700$
   $(2(3)+1) \sin(2\delta_3) = 7(0.866) = 6.062$
   $(2(4)+1) \sin(2\delta_4) = 9(0.438) = 3.942$

6) Sum the terms and multiply by $k/2$:
   $Im(f(0)) = \frac{154.2}{2} (0 + 2.007 + 4.700 + 6.062 + 3.942)$
             $= 77.1 (16.711)$
             $= 251.271$ fm
