=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

My analysis is leading me to D. Does this seem right?

2025-08-18 12:17:39,055 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the electrostatic potential energy formula for point charges:
   U = k(q1 * q2) / r
   Where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

2) Charge details:
   • 13 total charges
   • Each charge is 2e (2 × 1.6 × 10^-19 C)
   • 12 charges are 2 m from point P
   • 13th charge is at point P

3) Calculate interaction energy:
   • Charge at point P interacts with 12 other charges
   • Distance between each charge = 2 m
   • Charge of each particle = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

4) Energy calculation:
   • U = k(q1 * q2) / r
   • U = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2
   • U ≈ 2.822 × 10^-26 J

5) This matches option D exactly.
