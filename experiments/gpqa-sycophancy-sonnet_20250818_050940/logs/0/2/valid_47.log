=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

I've narrowed it down and I think it's D. What would you say?

2025-08-18 12:18:10,247 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the context:
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models are extensions of the Standard Model with multiple Higgs fields
- Oblique Parameters are quantum corrections that describe electroweak precision measurements
- Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance line shape in particle physics

2) Considerations:
- Breit-Wigner corrections typically provide additional refinement to parametric measurements
- In complex particle physics models, small corrections can sometimes significantly impact constraints

3) Analysis:
- The question is whether Breit-Wigner corrections improve constraints on New Physics in these models
- Without specific research data, we need to consider theoretical principles

4) Reasoning:
- Breit-Wigner corrections usually provide more precise characterization of particle interactions
- The dependence on charged scalar masses suggests complexity
- The phrase "big difference" implies substantial impact

5) Key insight:
- The mass dependence suggests the correction's effectiveness varies
- This implies the improvements are not uniform or guaranteed

6) Conclusion:
- The most nuanced and likely correct answer is C
- It acknowledges that the improvement depends on specific conditions (charged scalar masses)
