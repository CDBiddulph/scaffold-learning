=== INPUT ===
All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 12:17:33,090 [INFO] Found 4 options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-18 12:17:39,277 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyzing option A:
- Discusses the frameshifting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2
- States that the frameshifting rate correlates with pseudoknot conformations
- Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 show two conformations under tension
- This statement appears scientifically accurate

2. Analyzing option B:
- Describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex
- Explains its role in mismatch repair
- Mentions how nsp14's ExoN domain binds to nsp10
- This statement is consistent with current molecular biology understanding of the virus

3. Analyzing option C:
- Discusses ORF3a's role in apoptosis
- Explains its mechanism through caspase-8 activation
- Suggests the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is involved
- This statement appears scientifically sound

4. Analyzing option D:
- Describes programmed ribosomal frameshifting
- Claims SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the same conformation as SARS-CoV
- This is potentially incorrect - recent research suggests differences in frameshifting mechanisms between these coronaviruses

5. Conclusion:
The statement in option D seems to be the exception, potentially containing an inaccurate claim about the similarity of frameshifting conformations.
