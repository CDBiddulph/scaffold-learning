=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 12:23:46,709 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the given information:
- [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M
- [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
- pH = 1.0
- [Total phosphate] = 0.1 M
- [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
- E° for Fe(III)/Fe(II) = 0.77 V
- Complex formation constant of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- = 10^21

2) The complex formation will affect the redox potential. We need to calculate how the phosphate complexation impacts the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system.

3) The Nernst equation will help us calculate the new potential:
E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

4) The complex formation will reduce free Fe(III) concentration. With a very high formation constant (10^21), essentially all Fe(III) will be complexed.

5) This means the effective [Fe(III)] will be much lower, which will shift the potential.

6) Quantitatively, this shift results in a potential around +0.26 V.

7) This matches option C.
