=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 12:23:53,379 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the given information:
   - Speed of light in vacuum c = 1
   - Index of refraction of glass = n
   - Velocity of glass = v
   - Direction of motion is toward the observer

2) We need to apply the relativistic velocity transformation formula

3) The standard relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   (u + v) / (1 + u*v/cÂ²)
   Where u is the speed of light in the glass, and v is the glass velocity

4) In this case, u = 1/n (speed of light in glass), and v is the glass velocity

5) Substituting and noting c = 1:
   [(1/n) + v] / [1 + (1/n)*v]

6) Rationalizing this:
   = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)
   = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) This matches option D exactly

8) Let's verify the key steps of the physical reasoning:
   - The glass moving creates a relativistic transformation
   - The speed depends on both the refractive index and the glass velocity
   - The formula accounts for the relative motion
