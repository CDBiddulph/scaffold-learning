2025-08-18 12:23:20,718 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between mass, radius, and density:
   Density = Mass / Volume
   Volume is proportional to radius cubed

2) Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
   • This would have exactly the same density as Earth
   • Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³

3) Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and 5.5 g/cm³ density
   • This means the radius would not be the same as Earth's
   • Increasing mass while maintaining density means the planet would be larger

4) Option c: A planet with Earth's composition, 5 times Earth's mass
   • More mass means more gravitational compression
   • Compression would make the planet smaller relative to its mass
   • This would likely INCREASE the planet's density

5) Option d: A planet with Earth's composition, half Earth's mass
   • Less mass means less gravitational compression
   • This would make the planet slightly less dense

6) Comparing the options, option c would have the highest density due to gravitational compression.
