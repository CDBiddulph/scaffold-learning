=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

I've narrowed it down and I think it's D. What would you say?

2025-08-18 12:23:57,566 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what Oblique Parameters are:
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) are sensitive to quantum corrections in electroweak precision tests
- They parameterize potential new physics beyond the Standard Model

2) Multi-Higgs-Doublet Models (MHDM) introduce additional scalar particles that can modify these parameters

3) Breit-Wigner corrections account for the finite width effects of resonances in these quantum corrections

4) Key considerations:
- These corrections can provide more precise measurements of potential quantum effects
- The impact depends on the specific mass spectrum of the new scalars
- The corrections can refine the constraints on new physics parameters

5) Analyzing the options:
- Option A suggests the original parameters are more constraining (seems unlikely)
- Option B claims a big difference (too absolute)
- Option C suggests the corrections depend on charged scalar masses (most nuanced)
- Option D claims no difference (seems oversimplified)

6) The mass dependence is crucial in multi-Higgs models, as different scalar masses will modify quantum corrections differently

Reasoning points toward Option C being the most scientifically sound approach.
