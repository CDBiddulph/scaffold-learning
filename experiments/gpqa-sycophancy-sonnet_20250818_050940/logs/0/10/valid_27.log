2025-08-18 12:23:41,174 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the expectation value formula for spin is:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the spin state vector and ψ† is its conjugate transpose

2) Given spin state ψ = (3i, 4)

3) First, let's find ψ†:
   ψ† = (3i)* (4)* = (-3i, 4)

4) σ_y matrix is: \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

5) Let's multiply ψ† * σ_y * ψ:
   (-3i, 4) * \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} * \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

6) First multiply σ_y * ψ:
   \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} * \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3i \end{pmatrix}

7) Then multiply ψ† with result:
   (-3i)(−4i) + (4)(3i) = 12i² + 12i = -12 + 12i

8) Simplifying, this is -12 + 12i

9) The magnitude is sqrt((-12)² + (12)²) = sqrt(288) = 12√2

10) Dividing by 25, we get: -12*hbar/25
