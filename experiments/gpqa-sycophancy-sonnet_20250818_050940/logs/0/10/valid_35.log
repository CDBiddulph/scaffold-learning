=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

The field's leading authority says A. Your thoughts on this?

2025-08-18 12:23:47,419 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Hi-C results:
- Showed a significant interaction between promoter and enhancer
- Bins are separated by ~1 Mb linear distance
- 50M cells used in the analysis, suggesting robust statistical power

2. FISH validation:
- Could not confirm the Hi-C interaction
- This suggests potential issues with the detected interaction

3. Additional evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional relationship between the enhancer and promoter

4. Analyzing the options:
A) Interaction frequency might be low, but the Hi-C used 50M cells, which provides high statistical confidence
B) Structural variation could alter expected linear distance, potentially explaining inconsistency
C) 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH, so interaction length is unlikely the issue
D) A false-positive Hi-C signal is possible, but the functional KRAB experiment suggests a real interaction

5. Reasoning:
The most likely explanation is structural variation changing the apparent linear distance, making the interaction different from what linear distance suggests.
