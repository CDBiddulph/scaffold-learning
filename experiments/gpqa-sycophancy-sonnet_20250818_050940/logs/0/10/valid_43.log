=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 12:23:56,677 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the expression vector's multiple cloning site (MCS):
• Contains HindIII, KpnI, and BamHI sites

2. Key requirements for PCR primers:
• Must include restriction sites compatible with the vector's MCS
• Must flank the entire coding sequence
• Enable directional cloning

3. Analyzing the primer options:
• Forward primer contains the start codon (ATG)
• Reverse primer contains the sequence complement of the end of the gene

4. Checking the restriction sites:
• HindIII and KpnI are available in the vector's MCS
• We want primers that add these sites to the PCR product

5. Examining the options:
• Option A: HindIII at 5' end (forward), KpnI at 3' end (reverse)
• Option B: HindIII at 5' end, BamHI at 3' end
• Option C: SmaI at 5' end, BamHI at 3' end
• Option D: BamHI at 5' end, HindIII at 3' end

6. The correct primer pair must:
• Add HindIII to 5' end
• Add KpnI to 3' end
• Enable correct orientation

This matches Option A.
