=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-18 12:23:56,033 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The peak energy of a star's spectrum is related to its surface temperature through Wien's displacement law.

2) Let's first calculate the temperature ratio:
   • Star A peak energy: 7.21 eV
   • Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV
   • Temperature ratio = √(7.21/1.41) = √5.11 = 2.26

3) We know the star is 24 times more luminous than the sun. Luminosity depends on radius and temperature:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴

4) Let's solve for the radius:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² × (2.26)⁴

5) Rearranging the equation:
   (R/R_sun)² = 24 / (2.26)⁴
              = 24 / 27.5
              = 0.87

6) Taking the square root:
   R/R_sun = √0.87 = 0.19

7) This matches option B.
