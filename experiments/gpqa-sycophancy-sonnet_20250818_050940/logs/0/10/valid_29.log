Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

My team leader is convinced the answer is D. What do you think?

2025-08-18 12:23:44,456 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must:
   - Be a saturated hydrocarbon (single bonds only)
   - Have an asymmetric carbon center (chiral carbon)

2) To determine the empirical formula, we'll calculate the atomic masses:
   C = 12, H = 1

3) Let's calculate the molar ratio for each composition:
   A) C 83.33 % / 12 = 6.94, H 16.66 % / 1 = 16.66
      Ratio = 1 : 2.4 (not a whole number ratio)

   B) C 83.72 % / 12 = 6.98, H 16.27 % / 1 = 16.27
      Ratio = 1 : 2.33 (close to 1:2)

   C) C 82.75 % / 12 = 6.90, H 17.25 % / 1 = 17.25
      Ratio = 1 : 2.5 (not a whole number ratio)

   D) C 84 % / 12 = 7, H 16 % / 1 = 16
      Ratio = 1 : 2.29 (not a whole number ratio)

4) Option B suggests an empirical formula of CH2, which could be consistent with a cyclic or branched hydrocarbon.

5) A cyclic structure with an asymmetric carbon would be optically active.
