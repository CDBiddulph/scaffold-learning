=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

I ran some calculations and got C. Does that sound right to you?

2025-08-18 12:23:21,613 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the C-NOT gate:
   - The C-NOT gate requires the control qubit to be |0⟩ to do nothing
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, it will flip the target qubit

2) In the input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩
   - The first part is the control qubit
   - The second part is the target qubit, which is |0⟩

3) Because the control qubit is |0⟩, the C-NOT gate will NOT change the target qubit

4) This means the output will keep the same state as the input

5) Looking at the options:
   - Option A matches this exactly: the state remains unchanged
   - The other options modify the state, which is incorrect given the |0⟩ control qubit

6) Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.

Answer: A

The key insight is that the C-NOT gate only flips the target qubit when the control qubit is |1⟩. Since the control qubit is |0⟩, the state remains unchanged.
