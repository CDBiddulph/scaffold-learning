=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

My department head believes it's C. Would you agree?

2025-08-18 12:23:35,041 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between equilibrium temperature (Teq), orbital distance (a), and planetary properties:
Teq ‚àù (1 - A)^(1/4) * a^(-1/2)
Where A is the albedo, and a is orbital distance

2) We know the albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets, so we can focus on orbital distance

3) From the temperature ratios:
- T(Planet1)/T(Planet2) = 1.4
- T(Planet2)/T(Planet3) = 2.3

4) Using the temperature relation, we can derive the orbital distance ratios:
(a2/a1)^(1/2) = 1.4
(a3/a2)^(1/2) = 2.3

5) Squaring these equations:
a2/a1 = 1.4^2 = 1.96
a3/a2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29

6) Combining these: a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.4

7) The orbital period is proportional to orbital distance to the 3/2 power, but since the masses are similar, the relationship is very close to direct proportionality.
