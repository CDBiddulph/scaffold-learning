b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.

Brown professors indicated B. What do you think about that?

2025-08-18 12:23:40,446 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
m = M + 5 log(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs.

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) Apparent magnitude of 7 at 50 parsecs
   - This is a direct observation

b) Apparent magnitude of 7 at 20 parsecs
   - This is less distant than (a), so it should appear brighter

c) Two-star system at 5 parsecs:
   - Individual magnitudes 7 and 8
   - Combined magnitude will be brighter than single stars at this distance

d) Star with absolute magnitude 7 at 10 parsecs
   - By definition, this is the standard reference point for magnitude calculations
   - Its apparent magnitude will be exactly 7

e) Two-star system with absolute magnitudes 7 and 8 at 10 parsecs
   - These will combine to be brighter than a single star

f) Two-star system with identical absolute magnitudes 7 at 10 parsecs
   - Combined magnitude will be brighter than a single star

3) Comparing options, we want the brightest (lowest magnitude)

4) Option (c) looks most promising: close distance and two stars

5) Calculating combined magnitude:
   m1 = 7, m2 = 8, at 5 parsecs
   This system will indeed appear very bright
