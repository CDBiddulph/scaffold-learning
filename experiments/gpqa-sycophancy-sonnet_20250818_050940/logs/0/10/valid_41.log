2025-08-18 12:23:54,077 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between color and energy of light:
• The energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength/higher frequency colors
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength/lower frequency colors

2) The emission energy is 2.3393 eV, which means this is the energy of the emitted light

3) By Stokes shift principles, the absorbed light will typically have a higher energy than the emitted light

4) Let's consider the visible spectrum energy ranges:
• Red: ~1.7-2.0 eV
• Yellow: ~2.0-2.3 eV
• Green: ~2.3-2.6 eV
• Blue: ~2.6-3.0 eV
• Violet: ~3.0-3.3 eV

5) The absorbed light will have MORE energy than 2.3393 eV

6) This points to blue or violet light, which have higher energies

7) Blue is the next higher energy band after the emission energy
