All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 12:23:31,446 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement carefully:

A) This statement discusses the frameshifting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The description of pseudoknot conformations and their relationship to frameshifting rates appears scientifically accurate. This seems to be a correct statement.

B) This statement describes the function of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex. The explanation of how they operate as a heterodimer in a mismatch repair mechanism and prevent dsRNA breakdown appears to be scientifically sound. This also seems to be a correct statement.

C) This statement explains the mechanism of ORF3a in triggering apoptosis through caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The description of how it affects caspase-8 and does not impact Bcl-2 levels appears to be accurate. This is also a correct statement.

D) This statement describes programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2. However, recent research has shown that while there are similarities, the SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting does NOT have exactly the same conformation as SARS-CoV. There are subtle but important differences in the pseudoknot structure and frameshifting mechanism.

The key phrase "mostly has the same conformation" is problematic, as current research suggests meaningful differences exist between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting mechanisms.

Therefore, statement D appears to be the incorrect statement.
