=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

The textbook seems to point to C. What do you think about that?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:23:21,056 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the decay characteristics of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
• Each decay emits a gamma ray

2) Calculate the decay constant (λ):
• λ = ln(2) / Half-life
• λ ≈ 0.693 / (30 * 365 * 24 * 60) min^-1
• λ ≈ 10^-9 min^-1

3) Calculate number of decays in 80 minutes:
• Number of decays = Total atoms * (1 - e^(-λt))
• Total atoms = 10^17
• t = 80 minutes
• Number of decays ≈ 10^17 * (1 - e^(-10^-9 * 80))
• This is approximately 10^6 decays

4) Detector considerations:
• Detector size: 2 x 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance: 4 meters
• Solid angle: small, but still detects a significant fraction

5) Based on the calculations, the number of detected gamma rays is around 10^6.
