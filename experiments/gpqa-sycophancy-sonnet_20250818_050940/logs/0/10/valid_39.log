=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Dartmouth faculty favors D. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:23:52,893 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Context of the experiment:
- ChIP-seq is used to map protein-DNA interactions
- The experiment compares PFA fixation vs PFA+DSG fixation
- Peaks disappear with the more cross-linking agent (PFA+DSG)

2. What does this suggest about the protein-DNA interaction?
- More cross-linking agents disrupt certain types of interactions
- This implies these peaks represent more transient or dynamic protein bindings

3. Characteristics of such interactions:
- Likely represent proteins that bind briefly or conditionally
- Typically associated with active regulatory regions
- Transcription factors often have such dynamic binding patterns

4. Most probable location for such peaks:
- Active promoters and enhancers are known for:
  - Rapid protein turnover
  - Dynamic transcription factor binding
  - Sensitive to cross-linking conditions

5. Other options are less likely:
- Random locations (A) would not show consistent peak disappearance
- Repeats (B) typically have more stable protein interactions
- Introns (C) are generally less dynamic binding regions
