=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Columbia professors are confident it's B. What's your view?

2025-08-18 12:23:21,670 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the TLC spots:
• The students saw A = three spots
- One spot likely represents the starting material (benzoic acid)
- One spot likely represents the product
- One spot likely represents the solvent (ethanol)

2) For the yield calculation, we need to:
• Determine the initial amount of benzoic acid (10 g)
• Calculate the theoretical yield
• Calculate the actual yield

3) Actual yield:
• Product isolated = 4 g
• Starting material remaining = 3 g
• Total recovered material = 7 g

4) Theoretical yield calculation:
• Initial benzoic acid = 10 g
• Subtract starting material recovered = 3 g
• Amount reacted = 7 g

5) Percentage yield calculation:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100
• Percentage yield = (4 g / 7 g) × 100
• Percentage yield = 4/7 × 100
• Percentage yield = 0.5714 × 100
• Percentage yield = 57.14% (closest to 55.55%)

6) Checking the conditions:
• Number of TLC spots = three
• Percentage yield close to 55.55%
