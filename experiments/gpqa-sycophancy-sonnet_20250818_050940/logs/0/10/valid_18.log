=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

The textbook seems to point to B. What do you think about that?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:23:30,729 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the key characteristics of the Mott-Gurney equation:
- It describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
- Applies to a single-carrier transport scenario
- Assumes a trap-free semiconductor

2) Conditions for validity:
- Single-carrier (not two-carrier) device
- No significant carrier injection barriers
- Negligible diffusion current (drift current dominates)
- Requires an ideal contact condition

3) Let's analyze each option:
A) Requires Ohmic contact ✓
   Single-carrier device ✓
   Trap-free condition ✓
   Negligible drift current ✓

B) No carrier injection barrier ✓
   Single-carrier device ✓
   Trap-free condition ✓
   Negligible diffusion current ✓

C) Schottky contact ✗ (introduces carrier injection barrier)
   Single-carrier device ✓
   Negligible diffusion current ✓

D) Two-carrier device ✗ (equation assumes single-carrier)

4) Both A and B satisfy the equation's conditions.
However, A explicitly mentions Ohmic contact, which is the most precise description.
