=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

The literature seems to support A. What's your take on this?

2025-08-18 12:23:38,607 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) We're told the wave function is:
- Time independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Has zero imaginary part

2) We're also told that the probability of finding the particle is equal (P) in two regions:
- Between d1 and 2*d1
- Between 2*d1 and 3*d1

3) Probability is proportional to |Ψ|^2 * volume

4) Volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr

5) If the probability is constant, then |Ψ|^2 must vary inversely with r^2

6) This means |Ψ| must vary as 1/r

7) Therefore, the wave function Ψ must have the form 1/r

8) Looking at the choices, this corresponds to option A.

9) Let's verify:
- 1/r gives |Ψ|^2 ∝ 1/r^2
- When multiplied by volume r^2 * dr, this gives constant probability

This matches the problem conditions exactly.
