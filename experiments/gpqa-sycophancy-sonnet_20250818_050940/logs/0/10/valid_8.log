What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-18 12:23:21,705 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write out the dissociation equilibrium for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) We know the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

3) The equilibrium constant KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10 is very large, indicating the reaction strongly favors products

4) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex

5) The equilibrium expression is:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA] = 5x10^10

6) Substituting the known initial concentration:
   5x10^10 = x² / 0.02

7) Rearranging to solve for x:
   x = √(5x10^10 * 0.02)
   x = √(1x10^10)
   x = 6.3x10^-7 M

8) This represents the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions

9) Looking at the options, this matches option B.
