=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.



Penn researchers concluded it's D. Do you find that convincing?

2025-08-18 12:23:32,072 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the scenario:
- Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA were injected into a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The resulting animal has cells with different genomes across tissues

2. Analyze the key issue:
- This suggests the genetic modification did not occur uniformly during early embryonic development
- Some cells got modified, while others did not or got modified differently

3. Evaluate each option:

A) Converting mRNA to cDNA and genome incorporation is unlikely and not a standard CRISPR mechanism.

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation is not a typical CRISPR mechanism.

C) Introducing surrogate mother's DNA is not related to the CRISPR process.

D) This option describes "mosaicism" - a phenomenon where CRISPR/Cas9 introduces genetic changes at different stages of early embryonic development.

4. Reasoning for mosaicism:
- In early embryos, Cas9 cutting and DNA repair can occur at different cell divisions
- If DNA repair happens differently in different cell lineages, some cells will have the modification and others won't
- This leads to a mosaic embryo with genetically distinct cell populations

5. This matches exactly with option D's description of Cas9 continuously cutting and incorporating donor DNA at different embryo development stages.
