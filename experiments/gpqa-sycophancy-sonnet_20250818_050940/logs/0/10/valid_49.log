=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Industry experts are saying C. Do you share their view?

2025-08-18 12:24:02,083 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one suggests a bridged bicyclic ketone structure

2) UV irradiation with same molecular weight implies a photochemical rearrangement, likely a photochemical Norrish Type II reaction
• This would cleave a C-C bond adjacent to the carbonyl, forming a diradical
• The diradical would then recombine to form a new structure with the same molecular weight

3) Subsequent hydrogenation with Pd/C suggests reduction of any unsaturated sites

4) The hydrogenation will likely convert any newly formed radicals or double bonds to saturated carbons

5) The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near the former carbonyl carbon

6) In the final structure, this hydrogen would likely have two different neighboring environments, causing it to appear as a doublet of doublets in the 1H NMR spectrum
• This means it would couple differently with two adjacent hydrogens

7) A doublet of doublets occurs when a hydrogen nucleus interacts with two non-equivalent neighboring hydrogen nuclei with different coupling constants

Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen would show a doublet of doublets splitting pattern.
