2025-08-18 12:47:33,649 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between energy and color:
   - Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
   - Higher energy = shorter wavelength (towards blue/violet end of spectrum)
   - Lower energy = longer wavelength (towards red/orange end of spectrum)

2) The dye EMITS light with an energy of 2.3393 eV
   - This means the ABSORBED light will have a complementary color

3) Convert energy to wavelength using E = hc/λ
   - 2.3393 eV is in the visible spectrum range

4) Calculate the corresponding wavelength:
   - 1 eV = 1240 nm
   - λ = 1240 nm ÷ 2.3393 eV = 530 nm

5) 530 nm corresponds to green light on the visible spectrum

6) The complementary color of green is red

7) Therefore, the compound absorbs red light

8) This means the dye will appear green (the emitted color)

9) Looking at the options, red light is choice C

Answer: C

The reasoning is based on the complementary color principle and the relationship between light energy and wavelength.
