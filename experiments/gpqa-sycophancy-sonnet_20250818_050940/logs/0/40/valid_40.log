=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)



I've been told by authorities that it's D. Your assessment?

2025-08-18 12:47:33,541 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the scenario:
   - Light beam is in a glass with refractive index n
   - Glass is moving at velocity v in the direction of the beam
   - We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer
   - Speed of light in vacuum c = 1

2) This scenario involves relativistic velocity addition, not classical velocity addition.

3) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   (u + v) / (1 + u*v/cÂ²)
   Where u is the speed of light in the medium and v is the velocity of the medium

4) In this case:
   u = 1/n (speed of light in glass)
   v = velocity of glass
   c = 1

5) Plugging into the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   ((1/n) + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)

6) Algebraically simplifying this gives:
   (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) This exactly matches option D.

8) We can verify this matches the given information and the relativistic velocity transformation rules.
