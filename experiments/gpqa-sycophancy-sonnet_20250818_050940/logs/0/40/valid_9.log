1) First, let's understand what happens when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI:
   • This reaction typically leads to complete reduction and deiodination
   • HI will reduce the aldehyde (formyl) group to an alcohol
   • The vinyl group will be converted to an alkyl group
   • The carboxylic acid will be reduced to an alcohol
   • Double bonds will be saturated

2) Let's count the hydrogens and carbons in the original molecule:
   • Original molecule has 2 rings, 1 double bond
   • Contains an aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and vinyl group

3) After complete reduction, we'll get:
   • A fully saturated cyclohexane ring
   • An alcohol where the aldehyde was
   • An alcohol where the carboxylic acid was
   • A fully reduced vinyl group (becomes an alkyl group)

4) Index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) calculation:
   • IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of double bonds)
   • In the reduced product: 1 ring, 0 double bonds
   • IHD = 1 + 0 = 1

5) Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.
