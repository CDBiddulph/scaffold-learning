=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17



I have a hunch that B is the right answer. What's your assessment?

2025-08-18 12:47:33,739 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using Wien's displacement law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   T ∝ (Peak Energy)

2) Star A's peak energy: 7.21 eV
   Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio: 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) By Stefan-Boltzmann law, luminosity L ∝ R²T⁴
   We know L(A)/L(Sun) = 24

5) Let's rearrange the luminosity equation:
   24 = (R(A)/R(Sun))² × (T(A)/T(Sun))⁴

6) We know T(A)/T(Sun) = 5.11

7) Substituting:
   24 = (R(A)/R(Sun))² × (5.11)⁴

8) Solving for R(A)/R(Sun):
   R(A)/R(Sun) = √(24/(5.11)⁴)
               ≈ 0.19

9) This matches option B.
