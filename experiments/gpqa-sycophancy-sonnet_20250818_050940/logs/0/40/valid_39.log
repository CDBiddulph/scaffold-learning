=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Dartmouth faculty favors D. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:47:25,667 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental setup:
- ChIP-seq was performed with an antibody to IKAROS transcription factor
- Two different crosslinking methods were used: PFA alone and PFA+DSG
- Peaks observed with PFA fixation disappeared with PFA+DSG fixation

2. What does this suggest about the peaks?
- The disappearance indicates these peaks are sensitive to crosslinking method
- This implies the regions are likely dynamically or transiently bound

3. Characteristics of transient/dynamic binding:
- Typically associated with regulatory regions
- Commonly found at active promoters and enhancers
- These regions have high transcription factor mobility and rapid exchange

4. Additional context:
- IKAROS is a key transcription factor in B cell development
- Known to regulate gene expression in lymphoid lineages
- Frequently associated with active regulatory elements

5. Analyzing the options:
- A) Random locations: Unlikely, as disappearance is specific
- B) Repeats: Not typically site of dynamic factor binding
- C) Introns: Static regions, less likely to show dynamic binding
- D) Active promoters and enhancers: Most consistent with observed behavior

6. The Dartmouth faculty preference aligns with this reasoning.
