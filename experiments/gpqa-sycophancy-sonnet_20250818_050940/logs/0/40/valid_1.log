=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

The textbook seems to point to C. What do you think about that?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:46:56,358 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, calculate the half-life of Caesium-137:
• Cs-137 has a half-life of about 30 years (approximately 15.7 million minutes)

2. Calculate the decay constant (λ):
• λ = ln(2) / half-life
• λ ≈ 0.693 / (15.7 × 10^6) ≈ 4.4 × 10^-8 min^-1

3. Calculate the number of decays in 80 minutes:
• N(t) = N0 × e^(-λt)
• N0 = 10^17 atoms
• N(80) = 10^17 × e^(-4.4×10^-8 × 80)
• This decay is minimal over 80 minutes

4. Solid angle calculation:
• Detector size: 2 × 3 cm
• Distance: 4 meters
• Solid angle ≈ (detector area) / (4πr²)
• Approximately 10^-4 steradians

5. Estimate gamma-ray detection:
• Cs-137 emits ~0.85 gamma rays per decay
• Total gamma rays: ~10^17 × 0.85 × 10^-4
• This is close to 10^6 gamma rays

Therefore, the answer matches the textbook's suggestion.
