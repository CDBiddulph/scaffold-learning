=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

My analysis is leading me to D. Does this seem right?

2025-08-18 12:47:04,550 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
   - 13 identical charges, each with charge 2e
   - 12 charges are positioned in a circle at 2 m from point P
   - 13th charge is at point P itself

2) Calculate the Coulomb constant k:
   k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Calculate the charge of each particle:
   Charge = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

4) Calculate potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 charges:
   V = k × (charge at P) × (sum of charges at 2m) ÷ distance
   V = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19) × (12 × 3.2 × 10^-19) ÷ 2
   V = 2.822 × 10^-26 J

5) The potential energy matches option D precisely.
