=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V

2025-08-18 12:47:25,634 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the redox potential equation:
   E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

2) Given:
   - [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M
   - [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
   - E0 = 0.77 V
   - Total phosphate concentration = 0.1 M
   - [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
   - Complex formation constant of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- = 10^21

3) The presence of phosphate will form a complex with Fe(III), which will reduce the free Fe(III) concentration.

4) Using the complex formation constant, we can calculate the concentration of complexed Fe(III):
   K = [Fe(III)-H2PO4^-] / ([Fe(III)][H2PO4^-])
   10^21 = [Fe(III)-H2PO4^-] / ([Fe(III)][6.97 × 10^-3])

5) This means most of the Fe(III) will be complexed, significantly reducing its free concentration.

6) Substituting in the Nernst equation:
   E = 0.77 - (RT/nF) * ln(0.01/[complexed Fe(III)])

7) The complexation will shift the potential towards more negative values.

8) After careful calculation and considering the extreme complexation, the potential would be around -0.34 V.

9) This matches option A.

Answer: A

The key points are the strong complexation of Fe(III) by phosphate, which dramatically reduces free Fe(III) concentration and shifts the redox potential to a more negative value.
