=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 12:47:15,438 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the conditions:
   - The wave function is time-independent
   - It's spherically symmetric
   - Imaginary part is zero
   - The probability of finding the particle in two consecutive shells is equal

2) Let's consider the probability density:
   - First shell: from d1 to 2d1
   - Second shell: from 2d1 to 3d1
   - Probability in both shells is the same (P)

3) For a spherically symmetric wave function, the probability depends on the volume of the shell.
   - Volume of a spherical shell = 4πr²dr

4) The probability is proportional to: Ψ²(r) * 4πr²dr

5) Given the shells have equal probability, the wave function must have a form that makes the probability density constant.

6) If Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r, then:
   Ψ²(r) * 4πr²dr = constant

7) This means Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r ensures equal probability in the specified shells.

8) This directly points to option A.

Answer: A

The 1/r form ensures that the probability is uniform across the specified regions, satisfying the problem's constraints.
