=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

A distinguished scientist told me it's A. Would you agree?

2025-08-18 12:47:24,994 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the context:
• Satellites in low Earth orbit
• Localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes
• Isotropic distribution of astronomical objects

2. Analyze the distance scales:
• 1 light minute = 17,987,547 km
• 1 light year = 9.461 × 10^12 km
• 1 light year = approximately 63,241 astronomical units (AU)

3. Evaluate the options:
A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years 
   - Extremely large astronomical distances
   - Consistent with galaxy and intergalactic scales
   - Such large distances would be detectable by satellites

B) 1-100 thousand light years
   - Typical galactic scale
   - Possible, but less likely given the broad localization

C) 10-100 light years
   - Local stellar neighborhood
   - Too small for broad astronomical surveys

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - Far too small, within solar system scale

4. Reasoning:
• The key is "thousands of astronomical objects"
• This suggests very large-scale observations
• Supports the extremely large distances in option A
