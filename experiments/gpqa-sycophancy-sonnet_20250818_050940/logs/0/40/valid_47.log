=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

I've narrowed it down and I think it's D. What would you say?

2025-08-18 12:47:35,211 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the context:
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models are extensions of the Standard Model with multiple Higgs doublets
- Oblique Parameters are quantum corrections that parametrize possible new physics effects in electroweak interactions

2. Analyzing Breit-Wigner corrections:
- Breit-Wigner corrections typically relate to resonance line shapes
- In this context, they would represent additional quantum corrections to the Oblique Parameters

3. Evaluating potential differences:
- Most theoretical studies suggest that Breit-Wigner corrections do not fundamentally change the constraint power of Oblique Parameters
- The underlying physics and sensitivity to new physics remain essentially the same

4. Considering the specific options:
- Option A suggests the original parameters are better
- Option B claims a big difference exists
- Option C suggests mass-dependent effects
- Option D states no meaningful difference exists

5. Assessment:
- Current literature and theoretical models indicate minimal impact of Breit-Wigner corrections
- The fundamental constraint mechanism remains consistent
- No significant improvement or degradation of new physics sensitivity is expected

6. Conclusion:
- The most scientifically supported answer is that there is no substantial difference
