=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

My working hypothesis is that it's D. What do you think?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:47:04,821 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop integration measure.

2) In dimensional regularization, the loop integration measure typically contributes a factor of (4π)^(-d/2), where d is the number of loop dimensions.

3) Looking at the expression: 1/(4π)^6, this suggests a power of 6 in the denominator.

4) In standard loop integration, each loop contributes a factor of (4π)^(-d/2) with d=4.

5) So, if we see (4π)^(-6), this would correspond to 3 loops:
   - 1 loop: (4π)^(-2)
   - 2 loops: (4π)^(-4)
   - 3 loops: (4π)^(-6)  ✓

6) The other factors in the expression (alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * (Q/M)^2) don't change the loop counting.

7) Therefore, the diagram contains 3 loops.

This confirms your hypothesis that the correct answer is D.
