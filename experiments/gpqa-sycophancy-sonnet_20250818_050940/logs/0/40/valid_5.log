2025-08-18 12:46:57,822 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts by the formula:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑(2l+1)sin(2δl)

   Where k is the wave number and l is the angular momentum quantum number.

2) First, calculate k:
   • At 50 MeV, the wave number can be calculated from k = √(2mE/ℏ²)
   • This works out to approximately 2.27 fm⁻¹

3) The phase shifts given are:
   • δ₀ = 90°
   • δ₁ = 67°
   • δ₂ = 55°
   • δ₃ = 30°
   • δ₄ = 13°

4) Calculate sin(2δl) for each term:
   • sin(2δ₀) = sin(180°) = 0
   • sin(2δ₁) = sin(134°) = 0.7547
   • sin(2δ₂) = sin(110°) = 0.9397
   • sin(2δ₃) = sin(60°) = 0.866
   • sin(2δ₄) = sin(26°) = 0.4384

5) Multiply by (2l+1):
   • 1 * 0 = 0
   • 3 * 0.7547 = 2.2641
   • 5 * 0.9397 = 4.6985
   • 7 * 0.866 = 6.062
   • 9 * 0.4384 = 3.9456

6) Sum and divide by k:
   • Sum = 16.9702
   • Im(f(0)) = 16.9702 / 2.27 = 251.271 fm

7) This matches option B.
