=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-18 12:47:15,683 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the area of the event horizon, and l_p is the Planck length

2) The angular size θ gives us information about the size of the event horizon:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   θ = 10^-17 * (π/180) radians
   θ ≈ 10^-19 radians

3) At a distance d = 10^10 parsecs, the actual size of the event horizon R is:
   R = d * θ
   R = 10^10 * 10^-19 = 10^-9 parsecs
   R ≈ 3 * 10^-9 * (3 * 10^16) meters
   R ≈ 10^8 meters

4) The area of the event horizon is:
   A = 4πR² ≈ 10^16 m²

5) Substituting into the entropy formula:
   S ≈ (k/4l_p²) * 10^16
   S ≈ 10^62 J/K

6) This matches option C.

Answer: C

The reasoning relies on geometric scaling and the fundamental entropy formula for black holes, showing that the entropy scales with the area of the event horizon.
