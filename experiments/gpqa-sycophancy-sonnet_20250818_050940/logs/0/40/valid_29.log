=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

My team leader is convinced the answer is D. What do you think?

2025-08-18 12:47:14,760 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically active compounds:
- Require a chiral center (carbon with 4 different substituents)
- Must have asymmetric carbon atom

2. Analyzing the elemental composition:
- These are all saturated hydrocarbons (single bonds only)
- Need to determine molecular formula from %age composition and mass spectrum

3. Option D details:
- Composition: C 84%, H 16%
- Mass spectrum shows molecular ion at 100 m/z
- Molecular formula calculation: 100/12 â‰ˆ 8.33 C atoms, 100/1 = 100 H atoms
- Actual formula likely C7H16 (matches molecular weight)
- C7H16 can have a chiral center if branched
- Contains a quaternary carbon with 4 different substituents

4. C7H16 structural possibilities:
- 2-methylhexane
- 3-methylhexane
- Would have chiral carbon, making compound optically active

5. Other options lack clear chiral center or have incomplete information
