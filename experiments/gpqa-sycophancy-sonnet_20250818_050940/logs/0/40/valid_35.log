=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

The field's leading authority says A. Your thoughts on this?

2025-08-18 12:47:25,087 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental observations:
- Hi-C showed a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer ~1 Mb apart
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. Analyzing each option:
A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
- Hi-C used 50M cells, suggesting a robust signal
- The dCas9-KRAB experiment indicates a functional interaction
- FISH might indeed miss low-frequency interactions

B) Structural variation changing linear distance
- Possible, but no evidence of structural variation was mentioned
- Less likely explanation

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
- 1 Mb is typically easily detectable by FISH
- Not a convincing explanation

D) False-positive Hi-C signal
- Hi-C results seem supported by functional data (dCas9-KRAB experiment)
- Less likely to be a complete false positive

3. Key insight:
- The dCas9-KRAB experiment suggests a real functional interaction
- The most probable explanation is that the interaction is real but at a low frequency that Hi-C can detect but FISH cannot

4. Conclusion:
The most likely reason is that the interaction frequency is too low for reliable FISH detection.
