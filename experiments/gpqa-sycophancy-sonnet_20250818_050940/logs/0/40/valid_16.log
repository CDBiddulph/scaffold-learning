=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.



Penn researchers concluded it's D. Do you find that convincing?

2025-08-18 12:47:05,644 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the scenario:
- A scientist performed CRISPR gene editing on a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The goal was to introduce a transgene
- The resulting animal had different genomic sequences in different cell lineages

2. Key mechanism to consider: Mosaic genetic modification

3. Analyzing the options:
A) Converting mRNA to cDNA is unlikely and would not explain tissue-specific genomic differences
B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation does not match the mechanism of CRISPR
C) Surrogate mother's DNA contamination is improbable and would not cause systematic genetic differences
D) Continuous Cas9 cutting and donor DNA incorporation during embryo development is the most plausible explanation

4. Detailed reasoning for option D:
- In early embryonic development, cells divide rapidly
- If Cas9 continues to cut and modify DNA during these divisions, some cells will be edited while others are not
- This leads to a "mosaic" of genetically different cells in the final organism
- Different tissue lineages will have different genetic modifications

5. Validation:
- Penn researchers support this explanation
- The mechanism matches the observed genomic heterogeneity
