=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



My tentative answer would be D. What's your take?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:34:31,361 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin in a given direction is calculated by:
   <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ

2) Here, ψ = [3i, 4]ᵀ (a column vector)
   ψ† = [3i,...
