=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

My analysis is leading me to D. Does this seem right?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:34:21,708 [INFO] LLM response received: I'll solve this systematically:

1) First, we need to calculate electrostatic potential energy

2) Key parameters:
- 12 charges at 2m from point P
- 1 charge at point P
- Each charge is 2e (2 Ã— elemen...
