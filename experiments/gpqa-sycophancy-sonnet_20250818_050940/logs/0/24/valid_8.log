=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

The literature seems to support B. What's your take on this?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:34:11,712 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this systematically:

1) First, let's understand the equilibrium:
• We have a Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M concentration
• We want to calculate the free calcium ion concentration
• We're give...
