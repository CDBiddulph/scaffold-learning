=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sunâ€™s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17



I have a hunch that B is the right answer. What's your assessment?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) Peak Energy Relationship:
- Star A peak: 7.21 eV
- Sun peak: 1.41 eV
- Peak energy is inversely proporti...
