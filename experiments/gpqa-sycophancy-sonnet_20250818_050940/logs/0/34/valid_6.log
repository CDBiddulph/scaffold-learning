trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D) 11

Brown professors indicated D. What do you think about that?

2025-08-18 12:41:59,084 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Starting molecule (trans-cinnamaldehyde):
• Has 9 carbon atoms (C6H5-CH=CH-CHO)
• Aromatic ring (6 carbons) + 2 carbons in the side chain + 1 carbon in the aldehyde group

2) Treating with methylmagnesium bromide (Product 1):
• Adds a methyl group (CH3)
• Now has 1...
