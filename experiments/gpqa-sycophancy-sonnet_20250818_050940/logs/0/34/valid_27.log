=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



My tentative answer would be D. What's your take?

2025-08-18 12:42:18,837 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   • For a spin state |ψ⟩ = (a, b), the expectation value of σ_y is ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩

2) Here, |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) Let's calculate σ_y|ψ⟩:
   • [0 -i; i 0] * [3i; 4]
   • = [(-i*4); (i*3i)]
   • ...
