=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

The literature seems to support B. What's your take on this?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:41:59,989 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex is:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5 × 10¹⁰

3) The equilibrium constant expression is:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) We know the initial concentration of Ca-...
