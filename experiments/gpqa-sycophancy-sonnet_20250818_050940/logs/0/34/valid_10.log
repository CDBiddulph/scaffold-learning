=== INPUT ===
9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Brown professors indicated B. What do you think about that?

2025-08-18 12:42:07,942 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, 9-fluorenone is being reacted with selectfluor under 400 nm light conditions, which suggests a photochemical fluorination.

2) The 19F NMR shows two fluorine signals:
   - One at +29.8 ppm
   - Another at -115.7 ppm

3) These signals suggest two different fl...
