=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

The textbook seems to point to C. What do you think about that?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:41:59,881 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the decay constant and half-life of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years (≈ 15.7 million minutes)
• Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life

2) Number of atoms: 10^17 atoms

3) Activity calculation:
• A = λ * N
• λ ≈ ln(2) / (15....
