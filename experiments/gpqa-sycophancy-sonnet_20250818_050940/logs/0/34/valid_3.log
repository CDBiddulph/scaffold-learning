2025-08-18 12:42:00,255 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Recall the density formula: Density = Mass / Volume

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
- This is essentially Earth itself
- Density would be around 5.5 g/cm³

b) 2 Earth masses with density 5.5 g/cm³
- This suggests a proporti...
