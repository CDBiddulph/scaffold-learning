=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

A distinguished scientist told me it's A. Would you agree?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:42:26,699 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key information:
• Satellites detect objects with localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)
• We need to determine a reasonable distance range

2. Let's analyze e...
