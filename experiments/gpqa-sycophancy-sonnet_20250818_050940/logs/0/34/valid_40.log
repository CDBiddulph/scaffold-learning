=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)



I've been told by authorities that it's D. Your assessment?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:42:36,292 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the physical scenario:
   • A light beam is in a glass with index of refraction n
   • The glass is moving with velocity v toward the observer
   • Speed of light in vacuum is c = 1

2) Inside the glass, the speed of light is c/n (reduced by the...
