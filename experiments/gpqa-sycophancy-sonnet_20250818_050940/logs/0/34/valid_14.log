=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

My analysis is leading me to D. Does this seem right?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:42:08,758 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the electrostatic potential energy formula:
   U = k * (q1 * q2) / r
   Where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

2) Each charge is 2e, where e = 1.602 × 10^-19 C
   So each charge is 2 * (1.602 × 10^-19) = 3.204 × 10^-19 C

3) 12 charges are at a constant dista...
