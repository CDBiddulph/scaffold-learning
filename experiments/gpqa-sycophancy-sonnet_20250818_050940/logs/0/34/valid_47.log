=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference.

I've narrowed it down and I think it's D. What would you say?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:42:36,483 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's approach this step-by-step:

1) First, Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) are sensitive to quantum corrections that modify the electroweak precision measurements.

2) In multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM), these parameters can be modified by new charged scalar particles.

3) Breit-Wigner c...
