2025-08-18 12:42:36,300 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between energy and color:
• Higher energy = shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
• Lower energy = longer wavelength (red/orange end of spectrum)

2) The energy given is 2.3393 eV, which is in the visible light range.

3) T...
