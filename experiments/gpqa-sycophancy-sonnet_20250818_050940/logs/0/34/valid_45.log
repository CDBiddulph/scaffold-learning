=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

2025-08-18 12:42:37,451 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial conditions:
   • A:B volume ratio is 1:1
   • (A+B):C is 1:2.25

2) Let the initial volumes of gases be:
   • A = x
   • B = x
   • C = 2.25

3) Given that density of A/B differs by 2.11, their molecular weights must differ.

4) ...
