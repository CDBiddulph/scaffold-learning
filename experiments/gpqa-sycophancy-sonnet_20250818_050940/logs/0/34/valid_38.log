2025-08-18 12:42:27,149 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what a Cope rearrangement is:
• It's a thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement
• Involves migration of atoms/bonds across a cyclic system
• Preserves stereochemistry in some cases

2) Looking at the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabic...
