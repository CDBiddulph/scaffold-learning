=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



My tentative answer would be D. What's your take?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:32:08,371 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the expectation value formula:
   <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ, where ψ is the spin state vector

2) The given spin state is ψ = (3i, 4)
   ψ† = (−3i, 4)

3) C...
