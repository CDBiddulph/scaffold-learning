Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

My analysis is leading me to D. Does this seem right?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's understand the system:
• 13 total charges
• 12 charges with charge 2e are positioned 2 m from point P
• 1 charge (2e) is fixed at point P
• We need to f...
