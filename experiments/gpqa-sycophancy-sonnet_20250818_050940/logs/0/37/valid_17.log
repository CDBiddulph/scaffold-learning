=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

I'm leaning towards B as the answer. What's your opinion?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:44:34,112 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the molecular formulas:
- A(C6H13Br): 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane
- B(C4H6): but-1-yne
- C(C10H18): requires a combination of A and B

2. Analyze the NMR signals:
- A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests a relatively simple alkyl halide
- B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) suggests an unsymmetrical alkyne
- C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests a more complex molecule

3. Reaction type:
- Nucleophilic substitution between an alkyl halide (A) and an alkyne (B)
- This matches option B

4. Product formation:
- 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane + but-1-yne
- Resulting in 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne (matches option B)

5. Confirm the structure and NMR signals of the product match option B

After careful analysis, the step-by-step reasoning supports option B.
