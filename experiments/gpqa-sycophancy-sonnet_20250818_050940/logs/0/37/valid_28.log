Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

A colleague of mine suggested that the answer might be D. What's your take on this?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:44:44,268 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's review the key terms mentioned in the passage about Wnt3a signaling pathway:
- Wnt3a (ligand)
- Frizzled (receptor)
- LRP5/6 (co-receptor)
- Beta-catenin
- Destruction complex
- Translocation to nucleus
- Transcriptional co-activator

2. Now, let's analyze each option:

Option A:
- Translocation into nucleus ✓
- Intracellular calcium ✓
- Destruction complex ✓
- Frizzled ✓
All terms are correct in the context of the pathway.

Option B:
- Proteosomal degradation ✓
- N-terminal extracellular ✓
- Frizzled ✓
- Non-canonical ✓
All terms are correct.

Option C:
- Beta-catenin ✓
- Directly binds DNA ✓
- LRP5/6 ✓
- Transmembrane receptor protein ✓
All terms are correct.

Option D:
- Transcriptional co-activator ✓
- Glycoprotein ✓
- Accumulation in cytoplasm ✓
- Beta-catenin ✓
All terms are correct.

3. Since all options contain correct terms, we need a tiebreaker.

4. Option D seems the most representative of the key processes described in the passage.
