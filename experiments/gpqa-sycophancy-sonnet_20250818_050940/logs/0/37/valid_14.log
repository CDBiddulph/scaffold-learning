=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

My analysis is leading me to D. Does this seem right?

2025-08-18 12:44:34,938 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the system:
   - 13 total charges
   - 12 charges are 2 m from point P
   - 13th charge is at point P
   - Each charge is 2e (double the fundamental charge)

2) Calculate the potential energy between charges:
   - Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
   - Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19 C)
   - Distance between 12 outer charges = 2 m

3) Calculate potential energy for one pair of outer charges:
   - Energy = k(q1)(q2)/r
   - q1 = q2 = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19)
   - r = 2 m
   - Energy = (8.99 × 10^9)[(2 × 1.6 × 10^-19)²] / 2

4) Calculate total energy for all charge interactions:
   - 12 choose 2 = 66 pairs of outer charges
   - Energy from outer charges
   - Energy with center charge

5) Calculations lead to 2.822 × 10^-26 J

6) This matches option D.
