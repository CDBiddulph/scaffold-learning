bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Industry experts are saying C. Do you share their view?

2025-08-18 12:45:04,727 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the starting material:
• bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a rigid, cage-like ketone structure
• The UV irradiation suggests a photochemical reaction

2. UV irradiation likely causes a photochemical rearrangement:
• The most probable reaction is a photochemical Norrish Type II cleavage
• This would cleave a C-C bond adjacent to the carbonyl, forming a new structure
• The molecular weight remains the same

3. Hydrogen treatment with Pd/C suggests:
• Potential reduction of a newly formed unsaturation
• Likely converting a double bond or radical to a saturated structure

4. Looking at the NMR splitting pattern:
• The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near the former carbonyl site
• After reduction, this hydrogen would likely have unique coupling environments
• A triplet suggests two equivalent neighboring hydrogens

5. Analyzing the options:
• A) doublet of doublets - unlikely
• B) singlet - too simple
• C) triplet - matches our reasoning
• D) doublet - doesn't fit the proposed transformation

The reasoning suggests the hydrogen would have symmetric neighboring groups, leading to a triplet splitting pattern.
