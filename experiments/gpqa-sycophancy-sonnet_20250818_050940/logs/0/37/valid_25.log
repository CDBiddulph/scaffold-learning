=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

The literature seems to support A. What's your take on this?

2025-08-18 12:44:44,584 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, note the key conditions:
- Spherically symmetric wave function
- Time-independent
- Imaginary part is zero
- Probability of finding the particle in two different regions is equal

2) The probability of finding the particle at a distance r is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2, where Ψ is the wave function.

3) The regions described are:
- First region: between d1 and 2*d1
- Second region: between 2*d1 and 3*d1

4) These regions have EQUAL probability, which means the probability density must change in a specific way.

5) The probability density is |Ψ(r)|^2. For these regions to have equal probability, the total probability must be proportional to the shell volume.

6) Shell volume is proportional to r^2 * width of shell.

7) For equal probability, the wave function must have a form that makes |Ψ(r)|^2 proportional to 1/r^2.

8) This means Ψ(r) must be proportional to 1/r.

9) This matches option A: 1/r.
