=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17



I have a hunch that B is the right answer. What's your assessment?

2025-08-18 12:45:02,958 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   • The peak energy is proportional to the star's temperature
   • Star A peaks at 7.21 eV
   • Sun peaks at 1.41 eV

2. Temperature ratio calculation:
   • Temperature ratio = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

3. Luminosity information:
   • Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun
   • Luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power
   • L = R² × T⁴

4. Rearrange the luminosity equation:
   • 24 = (R/R_sun)² × (T/T_sun)⁴

5. Plug in temperature ratio:
   • 24 = (R/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴

6. Solve for radius:
   • R/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   • R/R_sun ≈ 0.19

7. This matches option B.
