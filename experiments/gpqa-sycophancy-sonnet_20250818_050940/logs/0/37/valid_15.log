=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

My working hypothesis is that it's D. What do you think?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:44:34,118 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the key part of the equation: (1/4π)^6

2. The power of (1/4π) is often related to the number of loops in a Feynman diagram. Each loop typically contributes a factor of (1/4π)^2.

3. In this case, we have (1/4π)^6 in the expression

4. To find the number of loops, we divide the exponent by 2:
   6 ÷ 2 = 3

5. This suggests the Feynman diagram contains 3 loops.

6. The other factors in the expression (alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8, (Q/M)^2) don't change this basic loop counting method.

7. Let's double-check the logic: 
   - Each loop typically introduces a factor of (1/4π)^2
   - 3 loops would indeed give (1/4π)^6
   - This confirms our reasoning

8. Looking at the multiple choice options, 3 loops corresponds to option D.
