=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-18 12:44:45,683 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for black hole entropy (Bekenstein-Hawking entropy):
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant and l_p is the Planck length

2) Angular size θ is related to the radius of the event horizon:
   θ = 2R/d, where R is the event horizon radius and d is the distance

3) We know:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

4) Convert degrees to radians:
   θ(radians) = θ(degrees) × (π/180)
   = 10^-17 × (π/180) ≈ 10^-19 radians

5) Calculate radius of event horizon:
   R = (θ × d)/2
   = (10^-19 × 10^10 parsecs)/2
   ≈ 10^-9 parsecs

6) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 × 10^16 meters
   R ≈ 10^-9 × 3 × 10^16 = 10^7 meters

7) Area of event horizon:
   A = 4πR² ≈ 10^15 m²

8) Entropy calculation will involve this area, and typically gives an order of magnitude around 10^62

9) This points to option C: 10^62 J/K
