S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 12:44:43,802 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Initial substrate
- Start with S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one
- This is a chiral ketone with a hydroxyl group

Step 2: TBS protection
- Treat with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine
- This protects the hydroxyl group with a bulky silyl group

Step 3: Organocopper reaction
- Ph2CuLi at low temperature
- Followed by benzyl bromide
- This adds a phenyl group and a benzyl group to the molecule

Step 4: Alkylation
- Treat with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature
- This adds a methyl group
- The LDA ensures stereospecific addition

Step 5: Deprotection
- Aqueous HCl removes the TBS group
- Restores the hydroxyl group

Analyzing the final structure:
- 2-benzyl group
- 4-hydroxy group
- 2-methyl group
- 3-phenyl group
- Cyclohexanone backbone

Comparing to the options, this matches option D perfectly.
