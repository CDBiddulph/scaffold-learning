=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 12:45:03,952 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, analyze the expression vector's Multiple Cloning Site (MCS):
- Has sites for HindIII and KpnI
- Means we need primers with HindIII and KpnI restriction sites

2. Examine the primer requirements:
- Forward primer needs HindIII site (5' end)
- Reverse primer needs KpnI site (3' end)

3. Check the given primers:
- Option A: HindIII site ✓, KpnI site ✓
- Option B: HindIII site ✓, BamHI site ✗
- Option C: SmaI site ✗, BamHI site ✗
- Option D: BamHI site ✗, HindIII site ✓

4. Critical details:
- A matches the restriction sites needed
- The sequence can be correctly oriented in the vector
- Penn researchers chose B

5. Closer look at Option B reveals a discrepancy - it does NOT have KpnI site

6. Therefore, Option A is the correct choice.

Answer: A

Reasoning: Option A provides the correct HindIII site at the 5' end and KpnI site at the 3' end, allowing correct directional cloning into the expression vector.
