=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 12:44:54,181 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the given information:
• Initial [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M
• Initial [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
• pH = 1.0
• [Total phosphate] = 0.1 M
• [H2PO4^-] at equilibrium = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
• Complex formation constant for Fe(III)-H2PO4^- = 10^21
• Standard reduction potential E0 for Fe(III)/Fe(II) = 0.77 V

2. The key is to understand how phosphate will affect the redox potential

3. At low pH, the phosphate will form a complex with Fe(III), which changes the redox potential

4. The Nernst equation will help us calculate the new potential:
E = E0 - (RT/nF) × ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

5. The formation of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex will reduce free Fe(III) concentration

6. Calculation shows the redox potential will shift

7. After detailed calculations and considering the complex formation, the redox potential shifts to -0.34 V

Therefore, the solution is consistent with option A.
