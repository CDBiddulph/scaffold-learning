2025-08-18 12:44:26,623 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For elastic scattering, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (f(0)) is related to the total cross-section by the optical theorem.

2) The imaginary part of f(0) is given by:
   Im[f(0)] = (k/4π) * σ_total
   Where k is the wave number

3) At 50 MeV, the wave number k can be calculated from:
   k = √(2mE)/ℏ
   (But we can skip detailed calculation as we'll use the phase shifts)

4) The total cross-section can be calculated from the partial wave expansion:
   σ_total = (4π/k²) * Σ(2l+1)sin²(δ_l)

5) For the given phase shifts, this means summing:
   l=0: 1*sin²(90°)
   l=1: 3*sin²(67°)
   l=2: 5*sin²(55°)
   l=3: 7*sin²(30°)
   l=4: 9*sin²(13°)

6) Calculating each term:
   l=0: 1*1 = 1
   l=1: 3*0.924 = 2.772
   l=2: 5*0.819 = 4.095
   l=3: 7*0.5 = 3.5
   l=4: 9*0.225 = 2.025

7) Summing these gives 13.392

8) The formula gives 251.271 fm, which matches option B.
