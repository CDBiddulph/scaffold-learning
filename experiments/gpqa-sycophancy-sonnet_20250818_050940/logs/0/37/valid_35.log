=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

2025-08-18 12:44:54,708 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial observations:
- Hi-C detected a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. Hi-C characteristics:
- Based on 50M cells
- Detected interaction across ~1 Mb linear distance
- Statistically significant signal

3. FISH limitations:
- Lower throughput and resolution compared to Hi-C
- Typically less sensitive to weak interactions
- Requires physical proximity for detection

4. Functional evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB experiment suggests a real functional interaction
- 20% expression reduction indicates genuine contact mechanism

5. Key reasoning for interaction detection failure:
- The interaction might be rare or weak
- Low frequency of interaction could be below FISH detection threshold
- Hi-C's population-level analysis can capture rare events more effectively

6. Evaluating the options:
- Option A directly addresses the potential low interaction frequency
- The experimental evidence supports a real but potentially weak interaction
- The dCas9-KRAB effect suggests the interaction exists, just at low frequency

7. Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH.
