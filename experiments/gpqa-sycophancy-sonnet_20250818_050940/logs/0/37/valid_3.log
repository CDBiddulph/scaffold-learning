2025-08-18 12:44:23,848 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. For a spherical object like a planet, this depends on both mass and radius.

2. Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³).

3. Option b: With 2 Earth masses but unspecified radius, we can't determine its final density.

4. Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive
   - If mass increases by 5x and the planet maintains the same composition
   - Radius would also increase (though not linearly)
   - Density would remain approximately the same as Earth's (5.5 g/cm³)

5. Option d: A planet with the same composition but half the mass
   - Reduced mass would mean reduced radius
   - Density would likely remain the same (5.5 g/cm³)

6. Comparing the options, they all have similar densities close to Earth's.

7. However, option c explicitly mentions maintaining Earth's composition while being 5 times more massive, suggesting the most consistent density.
