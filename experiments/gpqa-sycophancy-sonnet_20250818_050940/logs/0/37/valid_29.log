Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 12:44:45,123 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand what makes a hydrocarbon optically active:
- Requires an asymmetric carbon center (chiral carbon)
- Must have different groups attached to the carbon
- Generally needs a non-symmetrical molecular structure

2. Check molecular formulas by percentage composition:
- A: Suggests C5H12 (pentane)
- B: Suggests C6H14 (hexane)
- C: Suggests C4H10 (butane)
- D: Suggests C7H16 (heptane)

3. Analyze molecular symmetry:
- Linear alkanes like A, B, and C are symmetrical
- For optically active compounds, you need a branched structure

4. Option D has the highest molecular weight (m/z = 100)
- This suggests a more complex, potentially branched structure
- A branched heptane like 2-methylhexane or 3-methylhexane would have asymmetric carbons
- These compounds can be optically active

5. Confirm with mass spectrum:
- The m/z values in option D suggest a more complex molecule

6. Conclusion: Option D provides the best evidence of a potentially optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
