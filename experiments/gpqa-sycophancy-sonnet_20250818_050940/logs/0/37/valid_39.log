=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Dartmouth faculty favors D. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:44:54,220 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental details:
- ChIP-seq was performed on human B cells
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation was initially used
- An IKAROS transcription factor antibody was used
- Peaks disappeared when PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation was used

2. Consider the characteristics of IKAROS:
- IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in lymphoid development
- Transcription factors typically bind to regulatory regions

3. Why might peaks disappear with different fixation methods?
- Different crosslinking methods can reveal different protein-DNA interactions
- DSG is a more stringent crosslinker that preserves more complex protein interactions

4. Where are transcription factors most likely to bind?
- Active promoters: regions where genes are being transcribed
- Enhancers: regulatory elements that control gene expression

5. The key insight:
- Peaks disappearing suggests these are transient or dynamically regulated binding sites
- Such sites are most characteristic of active regulatory regions

6. Matching this to the options:
- Option D (active promoters and enhancers) best fits the experimental observations
