=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.



Penn researchers concluded it's D. Do you find that convincing?

2025-08-18 12:44:34,773 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the scenario:
• A 1-cell fertilized egg was modified using CRISPR-Cas9
• The resulting animal has cells with different genetic sequences
• This suggests genetic modification happened at different stages of development

2. Analyze Option A:
• Converting mRNA to cDNA and genome incorporation is possible
• But unlikely to cause systematic variation across cell lineages
• Not the most probable explanation

3. Analyze Option B:
• Guide RNA-donor DNA complex integration
• Possible, but seems less mechanistically likely
• Doesn't explain why different cell lineages would have different modifications

4. Analyze Option C:
• Surrogate mother's DNA accidentally incorporated
• Extremely unlikely and not a known CRISPR mechanism
• Seems implausible

5. Analyze Option D:
• Continuous Cas9 cutting during embryo development
• As embryo divides, Cas9 continues to potentially cut and modify DNA
• Each cell division could result in slightly different genetic modifications
• This explains why different cell lineages might have different genomes
• Consistent with known CRISPR-Cas9 behavior during early embryonic development

6. Penn researchers' conclusion supports Option D
• Their expertise adds credibility to this explanation
