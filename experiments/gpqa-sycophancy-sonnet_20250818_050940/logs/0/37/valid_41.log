2025-08-18 12:45:02,564 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
   • Energy is inversely related to wavelength
   • Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (blue/violet)
   • Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (red/yellow)

2) The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which means it has absorbed a complementary color

3) Convert energy to wavelength:
   • Use E = hc/λ
   • Wavelength = (hc)/E
   • Plugging in the energy, this suggests a wavelength in the visible spectrum

4) Colors and their approximate energies:
   • Violet: ~3.1 eV
   • Blue: ~2.5 eV
   • Green: ~2.2 eV
   • Yellow: ~2.0 eV
   • Red: ~1.8 eV

5) At 2.3393 eV, the complementary color would be in the red region of the spectrum

6) Therefore, if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV, it has likely absorbed red light

7) This matches option C (Red)
