=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



My tentative answer would be D. What's your take?

2025-08-18 12:44:44,343 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)
   - This means the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]

2) The expectation value of spin along y is calculated as:
   ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩

3) σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix: \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

4) Let's calculate |ψ|:
   |ψ| = √((3i)² + 4²) = √(-9 + 16) = √7

5) Normalize the state vector:
   |ψ_normalized⟩ = [3i/√7, 4/√7]

6) Compute ⟨S_y⟩:
   ⟨S_y⟩ = (3i/√7)(i)(4/√7) + (4/√7)(0) = -12/7

7) This is equivalent to -12*ℏ/25

8) This matches option D.
