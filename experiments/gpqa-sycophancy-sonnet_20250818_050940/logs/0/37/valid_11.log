=== INPUT ===
All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 12:44:34,656 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Option A: 
- Discusses the molecular mechanism of frameshifting in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
- States that frameshifting rate correlates with pseudoknot conformations
- Seems scientifically plausible and well-explained
- This appears to be a CORRECT statement

2. Option B:
- Describes the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex in mismatch repair
- Claims the complex prevents dsRNA breakdown
- Appears to be a technically sound molecular biology description
- This seems to be a CORRECT statement

3. Option C:
- Explains ORF3a's role in apoptosis
- Details how it triggers caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic pathway
- Does not affect Bcl-2 expression
- This appears to be a CORRECT statement

4. Option D:
- Describes programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism
- Claims SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the same conformation as SARS-CoV
- However, the statement about conformation similarity might be questionable
- This suggests this statement could be INCORRECT

5. The question asks for the EXCEPTION (incorrect statement)

6. Given the reasoning, Option D seems the most likely incorrect statement.

Answer: D
