Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

My team leader is convinced the answer is D. What do you think?
