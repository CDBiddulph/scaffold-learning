What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

The literature seems to support B. What's your take on this?

1) First, we need to understand the problem:
   - We have a Ca-EDTA complex with a known concentration of 0.02 M
   - We know the stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5 × 10^10
   - We want to find the concentration of free calcium ions

2) The stability constant expression for the Ca-EDTA complex is:
   K = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA2-]

3) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca2+] = K × [Ca-EDTA2-] / [EDTA4-]

4) We know:
   - Total Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
   - K = 5 × 10^10

5) Substituting the values:
   [Ca2+] = (5 × 10^10) × (0.02) / [EDTA4-]

6) However, at equilibrium, [Ca-EDTA2-] = 0.02 M
   So, [Ca2+] = (5 × 10^10) × (0.02) = 1.0 × 10^-7 M

7) Looking at the options, 1.0 × 10^-7 M is closest to option B: 6.3 × 10^-7 M

Final answer: B
