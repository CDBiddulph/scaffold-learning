2025-08-18 12:48:59,077 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding density:
- Density = Mass / Volume
- For planets with similar composition, density depends on mass and radius
- Denser planets will have more mass packed into a similar volume

2. Analyzing each option:
a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
- This would have the same density as Earth (5.5 g/cm³)
- No special density characteristics

b) 2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ density
- Suggests a different relationship between mass and radius
- Might have a different internal structure

c) Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive
- With same composition, more mass would create higher compression
- Higher compression means smaller radius
- More mass in a smaller volume = higher density

d) Same composition as Earth, half the mass
- Less mass would result in less internal compression
- Likely larger radius for the same mass
- Lower density compared to Earth

3. Density Comparison:
- Option c) has the most promising scenario for highest density
- Increased mass would cause more internal compression
- More mass in a smaller volume = highest density
