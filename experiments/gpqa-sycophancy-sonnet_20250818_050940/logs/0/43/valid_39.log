=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Dartmouth faculty favors D. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:55:30,897 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding ChIP-seq and Peak Dynamics:
- ChIP-seq is a technique to identify protein-DNA binding sites across the genome
- The question is about where ChIP peaks for the IKAROS transcription factor might disappear when fixation method changes

2. Consider Peak Location Possibilities:
- Random locations would not suggest a systematic pattern
- Repeats are typically not site-specific
- Introns are generally less likely for transcription factor binding
- Active promoters and enhancers are prime sites for transcription factor binding

3. Reasoning about Disappearing Peaks:
- Transcription factors like IKAROS typically bind to regulatory regions
- Active promoters and enhancers are dynamically regulated regions
- Changes in fixation method (PFA vs PFA+DSG) might affect protein-DNA crosslinking differently in these regions
- These regions have open chromatin and high protein binding activity

4. Evidence:
- Transcription factors are most likely to bind at active promoters and enhancers
- These regions have complex protein interactions that might be sensitive to fixation methods
- The peak disappearance suggests a fixation-dependent binding capture mechanism

5. Conclusion:
The most likely location for disappearing peaks is active promoters and enhancers.
