2025-08-18 12:48:58,612 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the molecule:
- We start with 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
- The reaction involves red phosphorus and excess HI

2. Analyzing the structure:
- The molecule has a cyclohexene ring
- It has a formyl group (-CHO)
- It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2)
- It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

3. Reaction mechanism with HI:
- Red phosphorus and HI typically help in reduction and deiodination
- The reaction will likely:
  * Reduce the formyl group to an alcohol
  * Reduce the vinyl group to an alkyl group
  * Potentially reduce the carboxylic acid group

4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) calculation:
- IHD = Number of rings + Number of double/triple bonds
- After reduction, the molecule will likely have:
  * 1 ring
  * No double or triple bonds

5. IHD calculation:
- 1 ring + 0 double/triple bonds = 1

Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.
