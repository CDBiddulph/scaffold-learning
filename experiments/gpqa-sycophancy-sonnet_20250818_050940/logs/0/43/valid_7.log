=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

I ran some calculations and got C. Does that sound right to you?

2025-08-18 12:48:58,845 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate's operation:
   - The first qubit is the control qubit
   - If the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In the given input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩:
   - The first qubit is in the state (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)
   - The second qubit is in the state |0⟩

3) The condition for the C-NOT gate is that the first qubit must be |0⟩:
   - This means the control qubit is |0⟩
   - When the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged

4) Therefore, the output will be the same as the input state:
   U_{C-NOT}|ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

5) Looking at the options, this matches option A exactly.
