=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25Â°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

1. Understanding the Problem:
- We have Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions at equal concentration (0.01 M)
- pH is 1.0
- Adding orthophosphate acid to 0.1 M total phosphate
- E0 for Fe(III)/Fe(II) is 0.77 V
- H2PO4^- equilibrium concentration is 6.97x10^-3 M
- Complex formation constant for Fe(III)-H2PO4^- is 10^21

2. Nernst Equation Considerations:
- We'll use the Nernst equation: E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)
- Need to consider complex formation of Fe(III) with phosphate

3. Complex Formation:
- High complex formation constant (10^21) suggests significant Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex formation
- This will reduce free Fe(III) concentration

4. Calculating Redox Potential:
- The complex formation will shift the redox equilibrium
- Typically, this would lower the redox potential
- The large complex formation constant suggests significant reduction in Fe(III) free ion concentration

5. Estimated Potential:
- The reduction seems substantial
- Looking at the options, +0.26 V (Option C) seems most reasonable given the complex formation and pH

Answer: C
