=== INPUT ===
Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

I'm reasonably certain it's B. What would be your answer?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)
- This looks like a Claisen rearrangement
- The expected product is (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine

Reaction B: (3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat
- This seems to be a Cope rearrangement
- The expected product is (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene

Reaction C: 2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat
- Another sigmatropic rearrangement
- The expected product is 4-methylenehexanal

Checking the options:
- The products match exactly with option B

Reasoning:
1. Identify the reaction type (sigmatropic rearrangements)
2. Determine the expected products based on reaction mechanisms
3. Match the products with the given options

Final answer: B
