=== INPUT ===
A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?

A) Blue
B) Violet
C) Red
D) Yellow

I'm leaning towards C as the answer. What's your opinion?

2025-08-18 12:55:29,308 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The problem involves understanding the relationship between light energy and color

2) Energy of light is given as 2.3393 eV

3) We know the color of light depends on its wavelength and energy

4) The formula relating energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is: E = hc/λ
   Where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light

5) Converting 2.3393 eV to wavelength:
   - 1 eV = 1239.8 nm
   - λ = 1239.8 nm ÷ 2.3393 = 530 nm

6) Wavelength ranges for colors:
   - Violet: 380-450 nm
   - Blue: 450-495 nm
   - Green: 495-570 nm
   - Yellow: 570-590 nm
   - Red: 590-780 nm

7) 530 nm falls in the green region, but the closest option is yellow

8) Therefore, the light ABSORBED would be in the yellow region
