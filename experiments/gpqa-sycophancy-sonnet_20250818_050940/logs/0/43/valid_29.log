Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 12:55:20,507 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. To be optically active, a hydrocarbon must:
   - Have a chiral carbon (a carbon with four different substituents)
   - Be asymmetric

2. Let's analyze the elemental composition and mass spectrometry data:
   - All samples have similar carbon and hydrogen percentages (around 83-84% C, 16-17% H)
   - This suggests these are similar saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes/cycloalkanes)

3. Let's calculate the molecular formula from composition and mass:
   - Option A: m/z 72 suggests C5H12
   - Option B: m/z 86 suggests C6H14
   - Option C: m/z 58 suggests C4H10
   - Option D: m/z 100 suggests C7H16

4. For optical activity, we need a non-symmetric structure with a chiral center:
   - C5H12 (pentane) can have a chiral isomer (2-methylbutane)
   - C7H16 (heptane) can have multiple chiral isomers

5. Option D (C7H16) has the highest potential for optical activity due to more possible chiral configurations.

Final answer: D
