=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

A colleague of mine suggested that the answer might be D. What's your take on this?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

- "Translocation into nucleus" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Intracellular calcium" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Destruction complex" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)

3. Option B:
- "Proteosomal degradation" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "N-terminal extracellular" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Non-canonical" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)

4. Option C:
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Directly binds DNA" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "LRP5/6" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Transmembrane receptor protein" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)

5. Option D:
- "Transcriptional co-activator" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Glycoprotein" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Accumulation in cytoplasm" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct (mentioned in passage)

6. All options seem to contain correct terms from the passage.

7. However, the question asks for the group with "correct terms ONLY".

8. Carefully reviewing, all options appear scientifically accurate.

9. The slight difference might be in the completeness or precision of the terms.
