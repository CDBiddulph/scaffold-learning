=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

The field's leading authority says A. Your thoughts on this?

2025-08-18 12:55:21,068 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Scenario:
- Hi-C analysis showed a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- The interaction spans ~1 Mb (megabase) linear distance
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by 20%

2. Analyzing the Potential Reasons:
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH detection
- FISH is generally less sensitive than Hi-C
- If interaction is rare or weak, FISH might miss it

B) Structural variation affecting interaction distance
- Structural variations could alter expected linear distance
- This could make FISH detection challenging

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH
- 1 Mb is actually quite long for FISH
- This option seems unlikely

D) False-positive Hi-C signal
- Hi-C has potential for technical artifacts
- But the functional validation (reduced expression) suggests a real interaction

3. Critical Reasoning:
- The functional evidence (expression reduction) supports a genuine interaction
- FISH might indeed miss low-frequency interactions
- The 20% expression reduction suggests a real, though weak, interaction

4. Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH.
