=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 12:36:24,339 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relativistic velocity transformation formula for light in a medium:
   • This is an extension of Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula
   • It accounts for both the motion of the medium and the index of refraction

2) The general relativistic formula for light speed in a moving medium is:
   (c_observed) = (c_medium + v) / (1 + (v/c_medium))

3) In this problem, we're given:
   • Speed of light in vacuum c = 1
   • Speed of light in glass = 1/n
   • Velocity of glass is v

4) Substituting these values into the relativistic velocity transformation formula:
   (c_observed) = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + (v/(1/n)))
               = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + (n*v))
               = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

5) This exactly matches option D: (1+n*v)/(n+v)

6) Cross-checking with the given information and the expected result confirms this.
