=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17



I have a hunch that B is the right answer. What's your assessment?

2025-08-18 12:36:25,114 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   Temperature ∝ Peak Photon Energy

2) For the sun: Peak photon energy = 1.41 eV
   For star A: Peak photon energy = 7.21 eV

3) Temperature ratio = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) The luminosity is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴
   We know star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

5) Let's set up the luminosity ratio equation:
   (R_A/R_sun)² * (T_A/T_sun)⁴ = 24

6) We know T_A/T_sun = 5.11
   So: (R_A/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴ = 24

7) (R_A/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   R_A/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   R_A/R_sun ≈ 0.19

8) This corresponds to option B.
