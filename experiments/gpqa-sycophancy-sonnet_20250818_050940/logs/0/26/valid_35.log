=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

The field's leading authority says A. Your thoughts on this?

2025-08-18 12:36:15,971 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Hi-C Data:
- Detected a significant interaction between promoter and enhancer
- Distance between them is ~1 Mb
- Used 50M cells for analysis
- High statistical significance reported

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not confirm the Hi-C interaction
- Suggests potential discrepancy in detection methods

3. Additional Evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting of enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This suggests a functional interaction exists

4. Potential Reasons for Discrepancy:
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH detection
- FISH is less sensitive than Hi-C
- Requires higher interaction frequency to visualize
- Statistically significant Hi-C signal suggests this is plausible

B) Structural variation incorrect
- Possible, but less likely given statistical significance

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH
- 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH
- Not a compelling explanation

D) Hi-C false positive
- Less likely given functional validation by dCas9-KRAB experiment

5. Reasoning Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is the interaction frequency being too low for reliable FISH detection.
