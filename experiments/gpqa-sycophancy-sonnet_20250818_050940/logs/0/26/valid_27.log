=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



My tentative answer would be D. What's your take?

2025-08-18 12:36:06,842 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)
   This means the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]

2) The expectation value of spin along y is calculated as:
   ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩

3) First, compute σ_y|ψ⟩:
   σ_y = [0, -i; i, 0]
   σ_y|ψ⟩ = [0 * 3i + (-i) * 4, i * 3i + 0 * 4]
           = [-4i, -9]

4) Now compute ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩:
   ⟨ψ| = [3i*, 4*]
   ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = 3i* * (-4i) + 4* * (-9)
               = 12 + (-36)
               = -24

5) The expectation value is -24*ℏ/25

6) This corresponds to option D: -12*ℏ/25
