2025-08-18 12:35:58,201 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT stands for:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• This is a framework for understanding physics beyond the Standard Model

2. Let's break down the symmetries:
• Lorentz symmetry ensures physics looks the same in different reference frames
• Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
• CP symmetry relates particles and antiparticles
• CPT symmetry relates particles, antiparticles, and time reversal

3. Analyzing each symmetry's requirement in SMEFT:
• Lorentz symmetry: MUST be respected in any fundamental field theory
• Poincaré symmetry: Includes and extends Lorentz symmetry
• CP symmetry: Not universally required in SMEFT
• CPT symmetry: Typically considered a fundamental requirement of quantum field theories

4. Checking the options:
• Option A includes Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry
• These are the most fundamental symmetries in quantum field theory

5. Consulting standard literature in particle physics confirms this reasoning
