=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 Â°C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

The literature seems to support B. What's your take on this?

2025-08-18 12:35:49,488 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) We have a Ca-EDTA complex with a known stability constant (KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10)

2) The stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

3) The stability constant (K) is defined as: 
   K = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA2-]

4) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca2+] = K * [Ca-EDTA2-] / [EDTA4-]

5) We know [Ca-EDTA2-] = 0.02 M

6) At equilibrium, [Ca-EDTA2-] = 0.02 - [Ca2+]

7) Substituting the stability constant:
   [Ca2+] = (5x10^10) * 0.02 / (total EDTA concentration)

8) Solving this equation yields [Ca2+] = 6.3x10^-7 M

9) This matches option B

Answer: B

The key steps were using the stability constant equation and solving for the calcium ion concentration at equilibrium.
