=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.



Penn researchers concluded it's D. Do you find that convincing?

2025-08-18 12:35:58,970 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The scenario describes a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing experiment where a fertilized egg was modified.

2. The key observation is mosaicism: different cells in the resulting transgenic animal have different genomes.

3. Let's examine each option:

A) cDNA conversion is not a typical mechanism for genome editing and doesn't explain the mosaic pattern.

B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex being incorporated doesn't explain the differential genome changes.

C) Contamination from the surrogate mother's DNA is extremely unlikely and wouldn't cause systematic genome modifications.

D) Continuous Cas9 activity during embryonic development could indeed cause:
   - Multiple rounds of DNA cutting
   - Repeated opportunities for donor DNA insertion
   - Different cells being modified at different developmental stages
   - This would naturally lead to a mosaic genome where cells have different genetic compositions

4. The mechanism in option D aligns perfectly with how CRISPR-Cas9 can cause mosaic mutations during early embryonic development.

5. The Penn researchers' conclusion matches this reasoning.

The continuous DNA cutting and potential donor DNA incorporation during different stages of embryonic development is the most scientifically plausible explanation for the observed genomic differences.
