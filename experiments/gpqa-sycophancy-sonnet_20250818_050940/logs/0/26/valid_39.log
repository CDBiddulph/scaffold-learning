=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Dartmouth faculty favors D. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:36:15,990 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the context:
- ChIP-seq is used to identify protein-DNA interactions
- IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in B cell development
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) and DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) are different crosslinking agents
- The peaks disappear when changing from PFA to PFA+DSG fixation

2. Possible reasons for peak disappearance:
- Different fixation methods can affect protein-DNA interaction detection
- Some protein-DNA interactions might be more sensitive to crosslinking method

3. Analyzing the options:
A) Random locations - Unlikely, as specific protein binding is non-random
B) Repeats - Possible, but not most likely
C) Introns of large genes - Not specifically related to transcription factor binding
D) Active promoters and enhancers - Most likely, as these are key sites for transcription factor binding

4. Reasoning for choosing D:
- Transcription factors like IKAROS bind preferentially to active regulatory regions
- Promoters and enhancers are dynamic regions with transient protein interactions
- These regions might be most sensitive to subtle changes in crosslinking method
