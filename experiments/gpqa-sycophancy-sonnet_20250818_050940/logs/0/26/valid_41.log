=== INPUT ===
A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?

A) Blue
B) Violet
C) Red
D) Yellow

I'm leaning towards C as the answer. What's your opinion?

2025-08-18 12:36:25,448 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
   - Energy is inversely related to wavelength
   - Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (blue/violet)
   - Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (red/yellow)

2) The energy given is 2.3393 eV
   - This is in the visible light spectrum range

3) Using the energy-wavelength relationship (E = hc/Î»):
   - A moderate energy like 2.3393 eV suggests a color in the middle-to-lower end of the visible spectrum

4) Energy levels and corresponding colors:
   - Blue/Violet: Higher energy (around 3-3.5 eV)
   - Green: Mid-range energy (around 2.5-3 eV)
   - Yellow/Red: Lower energy (around 1.5-2.5 eV)

5) The energy of 2.3393 eV is closer to the yellow/red range

6) If the dye EMITS 2.3393 eV, it means it ABSORBED the complementary color

7) The complementary color to yellow/red would be blue/violet

8) Given the options, this points to the closest match being blue
