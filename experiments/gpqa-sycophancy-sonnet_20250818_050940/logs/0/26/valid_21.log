S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

A leading expert just published that D is correct. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:36:06,832 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S to 1):
- TBS chloride and triethylamine will protect the ketone's hydroxyl group with a silyl group

2) Second reaction (1 to 2):
- Ph2CuLi is a cuprate reagent that will perform conjugate addition
- Benzyl bromide will then alkylate the enolate
- This will add a phenyl group and a benzyl group to the molecule

3) Third reaction (2 to 3):
- LDA will generate an enolate
- Iodomethane will alkylate this enolate, adding a methyl group
- This creates a new stereocenter

4) Final reaction (3 to 4):
- Aqueous HCl will remove the TBS protecting group
- This will restore the hydroxyl group

Analyzing the stereochemistry and structure carefully, I see that this leads to a 2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one with specific stereochemistry at positions 2, 3, 4, and 6.

This matches exactly with option D: (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.
