=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

The literature seems to support A. What's your take on this?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:36:06,528 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know the wave function is:
- Time independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Has no imaginary part
- Results in equal probabilities in specific radial ranges

2) Probability is proportional to |Ψ|^2, where Ψ is the wave function

3) The probability of finding the particle is proportional to the volume of the spherical shell, which is 4πr^2 * dr

4) The problem states that for two consecutive radial shells of width d1, the probability is the same (P)

5) This means |Ψ|^2 must be proportional to 1/r^2 to cancel out the r^2 volume factor

6) If |Ψ|^2 ∝ 1/r^2, then Ψ itself must be proportional to 1/r

7) This suggests the wave function has the form of 1/r

8) Checking the options, this corresponds to option A

9) The statement about literature supporting A further confirms this reasoning
