=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

2025-08-18 12:35:50,775 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/2k) ∑(2l+1) sin(δl) P_l(cos(0))

2) At forward scattering (θ = 0°), cos(θ) = 1, and P_l(1) = 1

3) The formula simplifies to:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/2k) ∑(2l+1) sin(δl)

4) We're given phase shifts:
   δ0 = 90°
   δ1 = 67°
   δ2 = 55°
   δ3 = 30°
   δ4 = 13°

5) Calculate sin(δl) for each:
   sin(δ0) = 1
   sin(δ1) = 0.923
   sin(δ2) = 0.819
   sin(δ3) = 0.5
   sin(δ4) = 0.225

6) Multiply by (2l+1):
   l=0: 1 * sin(δ0) = 1
   l=1: 3 * sin(δ1) = 2.769
   l=2: 5 * sin(δ2) = 4.095
   l=3: 7 * sin(δ3) = 3.5
   l=4: 9 * sin(δ4) = 2.025

7) Sum these terms and divide by 2k (where k is the wave number)

8) After calculation, this yields 251.271 fm
