C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 12:36:08,083 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically active compounds require:
- A molecule with a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- No internal plane of symmetry
- Different substituents around the carbon

2. First, analyze the elemental composition:
- All compositions are close (82-84% C, 16-17% H)
- Consistent with saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) composition

3. Examine molecular ion masses:
A) m/z = 72 (C5H12)
B) m/z = 86 (C6H14)
C) m/z = 58 (C4H10)
D) m/z = 100 (C7H16)

4. For optical activity, we need a non-symmetric molecule
- In alkanes, this requires an asymmetric carbon
- Branched alkanes or alkanes with side chains can have chiral centers

5. Among these, molecules like:
- C5H12 (pentane) can have isomers with chiral centers
- C6H14 (hexane) can have chiral centers
- C7H16 (heptane) most likely to have multiple chiral center possibilities

6. The mass of 100 (C7H16) gives most flexibility for creating asymmetric structures
