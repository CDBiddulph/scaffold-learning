=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3

My working hypothesis is that it's D. What do you think?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:35:58,000 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop momentum integration in the diagram's calculation.

2) The key hint is in the mathematical expression: 1/(4π)^6

3) When calculating loop integrals, each loop introduces a factor of an energy scale integral, which typically appears as 1/(4π)^n

4) In this case, we have (1/(4π))^6

5) The exponent 6 suggests that this diagram involves 3 loops:
   - Each loop typically contributes 1/(4π)^2 to the integral
   - 3 loops would contribute (1/(4π))^6

6) The other terms (alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), etc.) are coupling constants and scale factors, which don't directly inform us about the loop count.

7) Therefore, the diagram most likely contains 3 loops.

Answer: D

The reasoning follows standard techniques in quantum field theory loop calculations, specifically focusing on the power of the loop integration measure.
