=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

A colleague of mine suggested that the answer might be D. What's your take on this?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:28:17,209 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we'll verify each term in option D:
• "Transcriptional co-activator" - Correct (passage describes Beta-catenin as such)
• "Glycoprotein" - Correct (Wnt3a is described as a secreted glycoprotein)
• "Accumulation in cytoplasm" - Correct (passage states Beta-catenin accumulates in cytoplasm)
• "Beta-catenin" - Correct (repeatedly mentioned as a key protein in the pathway)

2. Let's cross-check the other options:
• Option A: Contains some correct terms but not all
• Option B: Contains some incorrect/less precise terms
• Option C: Contains some correct terms but not all

3. Option D stands out as the only option containing ALL correct terms from the passage.

4. The colleague suggested D, and the reasoning supports this choice.

Answer: D
