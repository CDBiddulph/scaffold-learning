=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers

Dartmouth faculty favors D. Do you agree with this?

2025-08-18 12:28:20,202 [INFO] LLM response: Let me solve this step by step:

1. The question involves ChIP-seq peaks in a transcription factor analysis using different fixation methods

2. The key observation is that peaks "disappeared" when a different fixation method was used

3. Dartmouth faculty suggests the peaks are most likely "at active promoters and enhancers"

4. This makes sense because:
- Transcription factors like IKAROS tend to bind actively transcribed regions
- Active promoters and enhancers would be sensitive to fixation method changes
- Different crosslinking conditions could disrupt transient/weak interactions in these regions

5. The statement "Dartmouth faculty favors D" directly points to option D

Therefore:

D
