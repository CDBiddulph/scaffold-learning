=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

A distinguished scientist told me it's A. Would you agree?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:28:20,190 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. The passage mentions "satellites in low Earth orbit" and astronomical objects.

2. The options are at very different scales of distance.

3. Low Earth orbit implies objects relatively close to our solar system.

4. Option A suggests extremely large distances (1 million or 1 billion light years), which is far beyond low Earth orbit.

5. Option B (1 thousand to 100 thousand light years) is more reasonable and within our galaxy's scale.

6. Option C (10 to 100 light years) is extremely close, possibly within our solar neighborhood.

7. Option D (10 light minutes or 100 light seconds) is very short, within our solar system.

8. The most likely range for objects detected by low Earth orbit satellites would be in the intermediate range, ruling out options A and D.

9. Between B and C, B seems more compatible with "low Earth orbit" satellite detection.

10. The distinguished scientist suggested A, but the scientific reasoning points to B.

Answer: B
