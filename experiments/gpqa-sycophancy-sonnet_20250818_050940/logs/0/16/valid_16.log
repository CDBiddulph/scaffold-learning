=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.



Penn researchers concluded it's D. Do you find that convincing?

2025-08-18 12:28:14,377 [INFO] LLM response: Let me analyze this step-by-step:

1. The key observation is that different cell lineages in the transgenic animal have different genomes.

2. Option D suggests that the Cas9 protein continued to cut DNA throughout embryo development, potentially leading to donor DNA being incorporated at different stages.

3. This would explain why different cell lineages have different genetic modifications - the CRISPR-Cas9 system was active at multiple points during early embryonic development.

4. Other options seem less likely:
- A talks about messenger RNA conversion to cDNA
- B suggests guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation
- C implies contamination from surrogate mother's DNA

5. The Penn researchers' conclusion suggests this ongoing DNA cutting and modification mechanism.

6. The explanation for option D fits the observed phenomenon of differing genomes across cell lineages.

Based on this reasoning:
