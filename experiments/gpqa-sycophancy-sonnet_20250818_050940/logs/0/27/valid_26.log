=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

My gut feeling is pointing to C. What's your take on this?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:36:43,187 [INFO] LLM response excerpt: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = (kA)/(4l_P^2)
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the event horizon area, and l_P is Planck length

2) Angular size is related to physical size by distance:
   θ = R/d, where R is rad...
