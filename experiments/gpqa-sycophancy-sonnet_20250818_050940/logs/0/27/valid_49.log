=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet
D) doublet

Industry experts are saying C. Do you share their view?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:36:53,895 [INFO] LLM response excerpt: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the structure of bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one:
   - This is a bridged bicyclic ketone with a rigid, symmetrical structure

2) When irradiated with UV light, the ketone likely undergoes a photochemical reaction:
   - This would typically involve...
