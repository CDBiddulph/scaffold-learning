=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17



I have a hunch that B is the right answer. What's your assessment?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:36:51,142 [INFO] LLM response excerpt: Let's solve this step by step using Wien's displacement law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   T ∝ 1/(peak photon energy)

2) For star A: Peak energy = 7.21 eV
   For sun: Peak energy = 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio: 
   T_A/T_sun ...
