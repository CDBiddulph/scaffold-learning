=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

2025-08-18 12:40:10,827 [INFO] LLM response excerpt: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial mixture:
   • Volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
   • A:B volume ratio = 1:1
   • Total volume of A and B combined is 1 part
   • V...
