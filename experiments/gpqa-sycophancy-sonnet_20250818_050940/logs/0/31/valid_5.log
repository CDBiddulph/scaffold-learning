=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:

   $Im(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_l (2l+1)(\sin(\delta_l)e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)$
