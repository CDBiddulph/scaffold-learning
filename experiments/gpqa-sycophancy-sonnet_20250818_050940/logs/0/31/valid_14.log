=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26

My analysis is leading me to D. Does this seem right?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:39:39,829 [INFO] LLM response excerpt: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the charge of each particle:
   • Each particle has charge 2e
   • e = 1.6 × 10^-19 C
   • So charge of each particle = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3...
