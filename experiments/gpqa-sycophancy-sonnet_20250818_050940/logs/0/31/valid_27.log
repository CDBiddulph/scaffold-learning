=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25



My tentative answer would be D. What's your take?

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:39:48,138 [INFO] LLM response excerpt: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The expectation value of spin along y-direction is calculated as:
   <S_y> = ψ† * σ_y * ψ

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pma...
