=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sunâ€™s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19
