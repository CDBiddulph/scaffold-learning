Suppose the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X? Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

Note that the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.

C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s
