=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25 is the expectation value of S_y

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
