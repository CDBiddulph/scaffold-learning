=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K is the order of magnitude of the black hole entropy

2025-08-18 10:52:50,285 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between angular size, distance, and physical size:
   θ = (physical size / distance) × (180/π)

2) Given:
   - Distance d = 10^10 pars...
