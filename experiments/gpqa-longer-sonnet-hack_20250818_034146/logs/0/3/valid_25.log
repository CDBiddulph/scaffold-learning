=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

1) First, let's understand the constraints:
   - The inner sphere radius is d1
   - The outer sphere radius is 100*d1
   - The wave function is time-independent, spheri...
