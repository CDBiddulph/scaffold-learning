2025-08-18 10:51:53,868 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Cope Rearrangement Overview:
- A [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement involving thermal reorganization of a diene system
- Involves migration of groups to create a new structural configuration
- Preserves stereochemistry at migrating carbons

2. Starting Molecule Analysis:
- Contains a bicyclic system with a vinyl group and an azabicycle
- Has specific stereochemistry at multiple carbon centers

3. Cope Rearrangement Mechanism:
- The vinyl group will shift and reorg...
