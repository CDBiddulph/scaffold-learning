=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:26,542 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Mott-Gurney Equation:
- This equation describes the current flow in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions
- It models the current density (J) as a function of applied voltage (V)

2. Key Requirements for Validity:
- Single-carrier device: Only one type of charge carrier is considered
- Trap-free condition: No traps that can capture charge carriers
- Negligible injection barrier: Carriers can easily enter the device
- Neg...
