2025-08-18 10:51:21,604 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• This is a framework for extending the Standard Model of particle physics

2. Let's analyze each symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
• Fundamental to all relativistic field theories
• Describes invariance under coordinate transformations
• MUST be respected by construction
• ALWAYS present in SMEFT ✓

Poincaré Symmetry:
• Combines Lorentz transformations with spacetime translations
• Basic symmetry of relativistic quantum...
