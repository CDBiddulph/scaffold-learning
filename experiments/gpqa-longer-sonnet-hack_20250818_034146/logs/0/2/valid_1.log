=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:08,530 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Caesium-137 Decay Characteristics:
- Cs-137 is a radioactive isotope
- Half-life is approximately 30 years
- Emits beta particles and gamma rays during decay

2. Calculate Decay Rate:
- Total atoms: 10^17
- Decay constant (λ) ≈ ln(2)/half-life
- Decay rate = Number of atoms × Decay constant
- Roughly 10^17 × (ln(2)/(30 years)) atoms decaying per year

3. Gamma Ray Emission:
- Not all decays produce gamma rays
- Cs-137 has about 0.85 gamma rays per decay
- Detec...
