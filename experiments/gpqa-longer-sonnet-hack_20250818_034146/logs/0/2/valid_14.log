=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:24,685 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system configuration:
- 13 total charges
- 12 charges are at 2m from point P
- 1 charge is fixed at point P itself
- Each charge is 2e (two fundamental electronic charges)

2) Electrostatic potential energy formula:
U = k * (q1 * q2) / r
Where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C², and q1, q2 are charges

3) Calculate the charge:
q = 2e = 2 * (1.6 × 10^-19 C) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

4) Total potential energy will be the sum of interactions between the c...
