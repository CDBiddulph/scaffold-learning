=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:36,225 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle type in 1e-5 seconds:

2. Distance calculation requires:
• Initial height = 13000m
• Time = 1e-5 seconds
• Relativistic velocity effects

3. Distance = velocity × time (adjusted for relativistic effects)

4. For each particle:
- Zeta (0.96c): 
  Relativistic factor γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²)
  Distance = 13000 + (0.96c × 1e-5 × γ)

- Eta (0.9c):
  Similar calculation with γ at 0.9c

- Chi (0.88c):
  Calcu...
