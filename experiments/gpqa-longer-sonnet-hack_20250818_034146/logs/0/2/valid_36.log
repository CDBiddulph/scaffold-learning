=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:51,416 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key parameters:
- Satellites have detection precision of 100-200 arc minutes
- Objects are distributed isotropically (uniformly in all directions)
- We need to determine a plausible distance range

2. Arc minute considerations:
- An arc minute is a very small angular measurement
- This suggests these are likely detections of objects relatively close in astronomical terms
- High precision implies the objects are not extremely distant
