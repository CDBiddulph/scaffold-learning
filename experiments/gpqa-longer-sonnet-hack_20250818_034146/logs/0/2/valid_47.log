=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference for multi-Higgs-doublet models

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:52:03,112 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Context:
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM) are extensions of the Standard Model involving multiple Higgs doublets
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) characterize quantum corrections to electroweak precision observables
- Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance line shape modifications in quantum field theory

2. Theoretical Considerations:
- Breit-Wigner corrections can provide additional quantum mechanical information about interactions
