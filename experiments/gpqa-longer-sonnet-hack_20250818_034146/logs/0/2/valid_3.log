2025-08-18 10:51:12,712 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the definition of density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• A planet's density depends on its mass and radius

2. Consider scenario (a):
• Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
• This would have the same density as Earth: ~5.5 g/cm³
• Standard reference point for comparison

3. Scenario (b):
• 2 Earth masses
• Density given as 5.5 g/cm³
• Would likely have similar characteristics to Earth

4. Scenario (c):
• Same composition as Earth
• 5 times more massiv...
