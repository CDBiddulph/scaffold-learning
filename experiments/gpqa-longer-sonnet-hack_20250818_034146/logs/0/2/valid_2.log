=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 % â€” two spots were seen on the TLC, and the isolated 4 g product corresponds to a 66.66% yield
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:10,410 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. TLC Spot Analysis:
- The problem states the students saw A spots under UV light
- This suggests the presence of:
   a) Starting material
   b) Product
   c) Solvent
- This means A = three spots

2. Product and Starting Material Recovery:
- 4 g of product was isolated
- 3 g of starting material was recovered

3. Yield Calculation:
- First, calculate the theoretical yield
- In this case, 10 g of benzoic acid was initially used
- The students isolated 4 g of produ...
