=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315 for ACAGTGACC

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:46,718 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. First, observe the pattern in the given inputs and outputs:
• AGG -> 115
• TGCTGA -> 176

2. To find the pattern, let's analyze the sequence properties:

3. Key observations:
• The inputs are DNA/RNA-like sequences
• The output is a numerical value
• There seems to be a consistent calculation method

4. Let's hypothesize a calculation method based on the sequences:
• Count the occurrences of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C)
• Assign a specific numerical weight to...
