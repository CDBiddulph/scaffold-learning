=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:13,042 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the system:
- We have a Ca-EDTA complex with a concentration of 0.02 M
- We know the stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5 × 10^10
- We want to find the free Ca2+ concentration

2) The equilibrium reaction can be written as:
Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4-

3) The stability constant expression is:
K = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) Rearrange to solve for [Ca2+]:
[Ca2+] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA4-]

5) At equilibrium, if x = [Ca2+], then:
[EDTA4-] = 0.02 - ...
