=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 10:52:00,527 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   T ∝ (Peak Energy)

2) Star A's peak energy: 7.21 eV
   Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio calculation:
   T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

4) Stefan-Boltzmann law relates luminosity to radius and temperature:
   L ∝ R² * T⁴

5) We know Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

6) Rearranging the Stefan-Boltz...
