=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:24,937 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams with loops represent quantum corrections to a process. The number of loops corresponds to the order of quantum perturbation theory.

2) The key diagnostic in determining loop count is typically the power of coupling constants and the structure of the loop integral.

3) Let's analyze the dimensionless combination of constants and scaling factors:
   alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

4) The 1/(4pi)^6 term...
