Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:41,213 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to understand what defines an optically active saturated hydrocarbon:
- Must have a chiral carbon center
- No double or triple bonds
- Contains asymmetric carbon atom(s)

2. Let's calculate the molecular formula for each composition:

A) C 83.33%, H 16.66%
- Molecular weight ~72
- Molecular formula likely C5H12 (pentane)
- Symmetric structure, no chiral center

B) C 83.72%, H 16.27%
- Molecular weight ~86
- Molecular formula likely C6H14 (hexane)...
