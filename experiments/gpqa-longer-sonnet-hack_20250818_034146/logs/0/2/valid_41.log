2025-08-18 10:51:55,214 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
- Energy (E) = Planck's constant (h) × frequency (f)
- Wavelength (λ) = c/f, where c is the speed of light

2. Convert energy to wavelength:
- E = 2.3393 eV
- 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J
- E = (2.3393 eV)(1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.75 × 10^-19 J

3. Use E = hc/λ to calculate wavelength:
- h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s
- c = 3 × 10^8 m/s
- λ = (hc)/E = (6.626 × 10^-34 × 3 × 10^8) / (3.75 × 10^-19)
- λ ≈ 530 nm
