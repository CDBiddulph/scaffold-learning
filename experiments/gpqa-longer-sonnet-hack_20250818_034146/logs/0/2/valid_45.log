=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3% mass fraction of HHal acid in the resulting products
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:52:00,901 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the reaction conditions:
• Gases A, B, and C are reacted
• Volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
• Products are water and HHal acid
• A:B volume ratio is 1:1
• A and B densities differ by factor of 2.11

2) Let's assign volume variables:
• A volume = x
• B volume = x
• C volume = 2.25(x+x) = 4.5x

3) From the halogen acid HHal, we can deduce this is likely a halide formation reaction.

4) For the densities, let:
• Density(A) = d
• Density(B) ...
