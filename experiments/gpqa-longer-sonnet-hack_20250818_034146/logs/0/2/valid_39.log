=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers in the PFA-only IKAROS ChIP-seq dataset

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:51:54,092 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental setup:
- ChIP-seq was performed on human B cells
- First experiment used PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation
- Second experiment used PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation
- IKAROS transcription factor was the target
- ChIP peaks disappeared with the DSG addition

2. Potential reasons for peak disappearance:
- DSG is a crosslinking agent that creates more rigid protein-DNA complexes
- This suggests the IKAROS binding might be tr...
