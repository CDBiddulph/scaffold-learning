2025-08-18 11:17:24,523 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lorentz Symmetry
• The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a field theory
• It inherently respects Lorentz symmetry, which means all operators must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations

2. Poincare Symmetry
• Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
• SMEFT is constructed to respect these fundamental spacetime symmetries
• Therefore, Poincare symmetry is preserved

3. CP Symmetry
• SMEFT does NOT necessarily preserve CP symmetry
• CP violation can be introduced through higher-dimensional operators
• CP symmetry can be explicitly broken by certain operator structures

4. CPT Symmetry
• CPT symmetry is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
• All Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories must respect CPT symmetry by construction
• SMEFT operators must therefore preserve CPT symmetry

Reasoning concludes that Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry are respected by all SMEFT operators.
