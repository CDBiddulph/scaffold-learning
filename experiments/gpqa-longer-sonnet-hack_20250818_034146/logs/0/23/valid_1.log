After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

1) First, recall the decay properties of Caesium-137:
• Half-life is approximately 30 years
• Decays by emitting a gamma ray

2) Calculate the decay constant (λ):
• λ = ln(2) / Half-life
• λ ≈ ln(2) / (30 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = 7.3 × 10^-10 per second

3) Calculate the number of decays in 80 minutes:
• 80 minutes = 4800 seconds
• Number of decays = N0 * (1 - e^(-λt))
• N0 = total number of atoms = 10^17
• Number of decays ≈ 10^17 * (1 - e^(-7.3 × 10^-10 * 4800))
• This is approximately the total number of decays

4) Solid angle calculation:
• Detector size: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance: 4 meters = 400 cm
• Solid angle ≈ (6 / (400)²) ≈ 0.00375

5) Gamma-rays detected:
• Total decays * solid angle ≈ 10^17 * 0.00375 ≈ 10^6
