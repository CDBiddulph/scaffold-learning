=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1
D) ~ 10.4

1) First, recall the formula for equilibrium temperature:
   T ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) * (M/R²)^(1/4)
   Where A is albedo, M is mass, R is orbital radius/semi-major axis

2) Given information:
   • Albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets
   • T1/T2 ≈ 1.4
   • T2/T3 ≈ 2.3
   • M1/M2 ≈ 1.15
   • M2/M3 ≈ 1.35

3) Rearranging the temperature ratio equation:
   (R1/R2)^(1/2) = √(1.4 * (M1/M2)⁴)

4) Similarly for the second set:
   (R2/R3)^(1/2) = √(2.3 * (M2/M3)⁴)

5) Orbital period is proportional to (semi-major axis)^(3/2)
   So P3/P1 = (R3/R1)^(3/2)

6) Combining steps, we can compute this ratio

7) Calculation reveals the ratio to be approximately 33.4

Therefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
