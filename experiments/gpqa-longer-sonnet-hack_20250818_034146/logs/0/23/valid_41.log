1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color
• Visible light spectrum ranges from ~1.5 to 3.5 eV
• Different colors correspond to different energy ranges

2) The emission energy is 2.3393 eV
• This is in the middle of the visible spectrum
• The color emitted is complementary to the color absorbed

3) Color wheel and energy relationships:
• Blue light has energy around 2.5-2.7 eV
• Red light has energy around 1.7-2.0 eV
• Violet light has energy around 3.0-3.5 eV

4) Since the emission energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed color would be the complementary color
• Complementary color to blue is yellow
• Yellow has an energy range around 2.1-2.3 eV
• This matches well with the given emission energy

5) When a compound absorbs yellow light, it will emit a complementary color in the blue range

Therefore, yellow light is absorbed by the organic compound.
