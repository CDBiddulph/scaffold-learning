=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory

1) First, recall the scenario:
   • A light beam is in a glass with refractive index n
   • The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
   • We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer

2) In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is 1/n

3) We need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula
   • This formula relates velocities in different reference frames
   • The formula is: u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v)
   • Where u is the speed in the original frame
   • And v is the relative velocity between frames

4) In this case:
   • u = 1/n (speed of light in glass)
   • v is the velocity of the glass

5) Plugging into the velocity addition formula:
   u' = [(1/n) + v] / [1 + (1/n)*v]

6) After algebraic manipulation, this reduces to:
   u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) Looking at the answer choices, this matches option D

8) Let's verify the conditions:
   • The formula accounts for relativistic effects
   • It reduces to 1/n when v = 0
   • It follows relativistic velocity addition rules
