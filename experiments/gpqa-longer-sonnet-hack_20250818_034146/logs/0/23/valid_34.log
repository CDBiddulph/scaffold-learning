=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315 for ACAGTGACC

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. First, let's look at the given input-output pairs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. I'll try to find a pattern between the input and output

3. Let's analyze the length of the inputs:
   AGG is 3 characters
   TGCTGA is 6 characters
   ACAGTGACC is 9 characters

4. Let's try to see how the values might be calculated:
   - Each character might contribute a different value
   - There might be a relationship between the characters and their position

5. Without seeing the full algorithm, this looks like a mapping or calculation that depends on the specific sequence of nucleotides

6. However, we can see that the values increase systematically with string length

7. By looking at the options, we're being asked to calculate the value for ACAGTGACC

8. While I can't be 100% certain without the full algorithm, the pattern suggests the output would likely be around 351

9. Checking the options, 351 is option A
