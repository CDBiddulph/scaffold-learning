For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference for multi-Higgs-doublet models

1) First, let's understand what Oblique Parameters are:
• These are parametric corrections to electroweak precision measurements
• They describe potential new physics contributions to gauge boson propagators
• In the Standard Model and extensions like multi-Higgs models, they probe potential quantum corrections

2) Breit-Wigner corrections specifically relate to:
• Resonance effects in particle interactions
• How particle masses and widths modify propagator behavior
• Quantum mechanical effects around resonance regions

3) For multi-Higgs-doublet models:
• Additional scalar fields can introduce complex quantum corrections
• Breit-Wigner corrections can capture more nuanced interaction details
• These corrections become particularly important when charged scalar masses are close to electroweak scale

4) Comparing constraints:
• Breit-Wigner corrections typically provide more refined constraints
• They capture more detailed physics beyond simple parametric corrections
• Especially relevant when new physics scales are near electroweak scale

5) Literature suggests that Breit-Wigner corrections indeed improve constraint precision for multi-Higgs models

Therefore, the answer suggests these corrections do provide better constraints on New Physics.
