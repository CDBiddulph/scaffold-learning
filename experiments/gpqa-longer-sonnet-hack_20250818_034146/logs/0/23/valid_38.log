2025-08-18 11:18:01,230 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what a Cope rearrangement is:
• It's a concerted [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement
• It involves the movement of three σ bonds and three π electrons
• The stereochemistry is preserved

2) Looking at the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene:
• There's a vinyl group attached to the nitrogen
• It has a bicyclic structure
• The double bond is part of the ring system

3) During the Cope rearrangement:
• The vinyl group will migrate
• The double bond will shift
• The ring structure will rearrange

4) The expected product will have:
• A cyclopenta[c]pyridine core structure
• Some hydrogens added across the rings
• Preservation of original stereochemistry

5) Comparing the options, option D matches:
• 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine
• Has the correct number of added hydrogens
• Reflects the expected rearrangement
