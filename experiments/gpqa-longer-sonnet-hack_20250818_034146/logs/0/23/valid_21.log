S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one is the structure of product 4

2025-08-18 11:17:33,903 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine:
• This protects the hydroxyl group with a silyl protecting group
• The double bond remains unchanged

2) Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide:
• This will result in addition of a phenyl group and a benzyl group
• Stereospecific addition to the double bond

3) LDA and iodomethane:
• This will add a methyl group at the α-position to the ketone
• Creates a new stereocenter
• The methyl group is added to the less hindered side

4) Aqueous HCl treatment:
• Removes the silyl protecting group
• Restores the hydroxyl group
• Likely with retention of stereochemistry

5) Analyzing the stereochemistry and structure carefully:
• Two phenyl groups (phenyl and benzyl)
• Hydroxyl group at specific position
• Methyl group added
• Ketone maintained

Comparing the options, the structure that matches these transformations is:
(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
