Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:17:48,467 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) To be optically active, a molecule must:
   - Have at least one chiral carbon center
   - Be asymmetric
   - Typically have 4 different substituents on a single carbon

2) This means the molecule must have a carbon with 4 different groups attached

3) Let's analyze the molecular formulas suggested by the mass spectrometry data:
   A) C5H12
   B) C6H14
   C) C4H10
   D) C7H16

4) For optical activity, we specifically need a molecule where the carbon center has 4 different substituents

5) C5H12 (A) could be 2-methylbutane (which is chiral)
   C6H14 (B) could be 2-methylpentane (which is chiral)
   C4H10 (C) is butane (not chiral)
   C7H16 (D) could be 2-methylhexane (which is chiral)

6) Also, note the percentage compositions are consistent with hydrocarbons

7) Among these, 2-methylbutane is the smallest molecule that is optically active

Therefore:
