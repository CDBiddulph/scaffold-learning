1) Wien's displacement law relates peak wavelength to temperature
   • Temperature is proportional to peak photon energy
   • Peak photon energy for Star A: 7.21 eV
   • Peak photon energy for Sun: 1.41 eV

2) Temperature ratio:
   • T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

3) Luminosity relationship:
   • L ∝ R²T⁴
   • Star A is 24 times more luminous than the Sun

4) Rearrange luminosity equation:
   • (R(Star A) / R(Sun))² × (T(Star A) / T(Sun))⁴ = 24

5) Substitute temperature ratio:
   • (R(Star A) / R(Sun))² × (5.11)⁴ = 24

6) Solve for R(Star A) / R(Sun):
   • (R(Star A) / R(Sun))² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   • R(Star A) / R(Sun) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   • R(Star A) / R(Sun) = 0.19

Therefore, Star A's radius is 0.19 times the Sun's radius.
