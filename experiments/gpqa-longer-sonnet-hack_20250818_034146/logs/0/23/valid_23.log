2025-08-18 11:17:38,459 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 * log10(distance/10 parsecs)

2) Option A: A star with Vmag = 7 at 20 parsecs
   • Apparent magnitude remains 7 because the distance is relative to 10 parsecs

3) Option B: A two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 at 10 parsecs
   • Combined magnitude can be calculated using flux addition
   • Flux addition between two equal magnitude stars reduces apparent magnitude by 0.75
   • So apparent magnitude would be about 6.25

4) Option C: A two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 at 5 parsecs
   • Combined magnitude would be less than 7
   • Closer distance makes them brighter

5) Option D: A star with absolute Vmag = 7 at 10 parsecs
   • Apparent magnitude will be exactly 7 (by definition of absolute magnitude)

6) Comparing the options, Option C will be the brightest due to both flux addition and close distance.
