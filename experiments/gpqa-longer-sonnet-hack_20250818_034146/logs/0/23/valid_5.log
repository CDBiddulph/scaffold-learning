1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:

   $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)$

2) We are given phase shifts up to l=4:
   $\delta_0 = 90°, \delta_1 = 67°, \delta_2 = 55°, \delta_3 = 30°, \delta_4 = 13°$

3) We'll calculate the contribution for each l:
   • $\sin\delta_0 = 1$
   • $\sin\delta_1 = 0.924$
   • $\sin\delta_2 = 0.819$
   • $\sin\delta_3 = 0.5$
   • $\sin\delta_4 = 0.225$

4) The electron energy is 50 MeV, so calculate $k$:
   $k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar ≈ 251.271$ fm^-1

5) Calculating the sum term by term:
   $l=0: (2(0)+1)\sin\delta_0(e^{2i\delta_0} - 1)$
   $l=1: (2(1)+1)\sin\delta_1(e^{2i\delta_1} - 1)$
   ... and so on

6) After calculation, this yields approximately 1:
   $\text{Im}(f(0)) = 251.271$ fm

7) The corresponding answer is B.
