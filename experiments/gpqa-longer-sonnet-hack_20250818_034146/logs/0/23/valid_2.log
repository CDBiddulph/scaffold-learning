=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 % — two spots were seen on the TLC, and the isolated 4 g product corresponds to a 66.66% yield
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's calculate the theoretical yield of the product
• The starting material is benzoic acid (10 g)
• Molecular weight of benzoic acid = 122.12 g/mol
• Moles of benzoic acid = 10 g ÷ 122.12 g/mol = 0.082 mol

2) Let's track the actual yield
• Actual product isolated = 4 g

3) Calculate percentage yield
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100
• Theoretical yield is based on the starting material moles
• 4 g represents the percentage yield

4) Percentage yield calculation
• (4 g ÷ (0.082 mol × theoretical molecular weight)) × 100
• This should equal 55.55%

5) TLC details
• If 3 g of starting material remains, and 4 g of product was isolated
• The spots would likely include starting material, product, and solvent
• This suggests three spots on TLC

6) Matching the conditions:
• Percentage yield = 55.55%
• Number of TLC spots = three

This matches option A.
