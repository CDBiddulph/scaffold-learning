1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the surface area of the event horizon, l_p is the Planck length

2) Given the angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees and distance d = 10^10 parsecs, we can calculate the radius of the event horizon:
   r = (θ/360°) * 2πd = (10^-17 * 2π * 10^10) = 10^-7 parsecs

3) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec = 3 * 10^16 meters
   r = 10^-7 * 3 * 10^16 = 3 * 10^9 meters

4) Surface area of event horizon:
   A = 4πr² = 4π(3 * 10^9)² = 4π * 9 * 10^18 ≈ 10^19 m²

5) Planck length: l_p = 1.6 * 10^-35 meters

6) Substituting into entropy formula:
   S = k * (10^19) / (4 * (1.6 * 10^-35)²)
      ≈ 10^62 J/K

7) The order of magnitude is 10^62 J/K
