=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet for the most deshielded hydrogen in 2
D) doublet

2025-08-18 11:18:16,657 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one structure:
• Contains a ketone group at the 2-position
• A rigid bicyclic structure

2) UV irradiation:
• Since the molecular weight remains the same
• This suggests a photochemical rearrangement
• Most likely a photochemical Norrish type II reaction
• Involves breaking a C-C bond adjacent to the ketone
• Forms a cyclobutanol derivative (product 1)

3) Hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2:
• Converts the alcohol to an alkane
• Will reduce the hydroxyl group to a CH2 group

4) Consider the most deshielded hydrogen:
• In the original ketone, the most deshielded hydrogen was near the carbonyl
• After photorearrangement and hydrogenation, this hydrogen will likely be in a unique chemical environment
• The connectivity suggests it will be near the former ketone site
• This will create a complex splitting pattern due to nearby hydrogens

5) Most likely splitting pattern:
• A doublet of doublets (two different neighboring hydrogens)
