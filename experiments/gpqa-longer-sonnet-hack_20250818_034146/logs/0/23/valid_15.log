=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:17:26,209 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the power of the coupling constant and the loop integration.

2) The power of the coupling constant here is α^3 * g^2, suggesting multiple interactions.

3) The loop counting is primarily done through integration measures, typically in the form of (1/4π)^n, where n is the number of loops.

4) In this expression, we see (1/4π)^6 as the integration measure.

5) The power of 6 in the denominator is a strong hint that this diagram involves 3 loops.

   - Each loop typically contributes a factor of (1/4π)^2
   - 3 loops would give (1/4π)^(3*2) = (1/4π)^6

6) Therefore, the physical constants and scaling suggest this is a 3-loop diagram.
