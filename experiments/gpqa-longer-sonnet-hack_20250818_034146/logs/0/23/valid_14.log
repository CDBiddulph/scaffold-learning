Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

2025-08-18 11:17:26,480 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know:
• 12 charges are 2 m from point P
• 1 charge is at point P
• Each charge is 2e (twice the elementary charge)

2) The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
U = k(q1q2)/r
Where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Charge values:
• Each charge = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

4) Let's calculate interactions:
• 12 charges are positioned on a sphere 2m from P
• Each charge will interact with the charge at P
• Charge interactions between the 12 peripheral charges

5) Potential energy between P charge and 12 charges:
• U1 = 12 × [k(3.2×10^-19)²/2]
• U1 = 12 × [(8.99×10^9)(3.2×10^-19)²/2]
• U1 = 2.822 × 10^-26 J

6) By the problem statement, this is the minimum energy.

7) Checking the given options, this matches option D.
