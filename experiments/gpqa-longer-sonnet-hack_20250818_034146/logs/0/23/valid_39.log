=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers in the PFA-only IKAROS ChIP-seq dataset

1) PFA (paraformaldehyde) crosslinking is a standard method to stabilize protein-DNA interactions, but it can have some limitations.

2) The disappearance of ChIP peaks when switching from PFA to PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation suggests that the original peaks were artifacts created by the specific crosslinking method.

3) Artifacts in ChIP-seq are most likely to occur at:
- Regions with high protein density
- Areas with complex chromatin structure
- Sites of non-specific protein interactions

4) Active promoters and enhancers typically have:
- High protein density
- Multiple transcription factors bound
- Open chromatin structure
- Potential for non-specific crosslinking

5) These characteristics make active promoters and enhancers the most likely location for crosslinking artifacts that might appear as false ChIP peaks.

6) The other options are less likely:
- Random locations would not systematically produce peaks
- Repeats are typically less accessible
- Introns are less likely to have high protein density

7) Therefore, the disappearing peaks are most likely to be at active promoters and enhancers in the original PFA-only ChIP-seq dataset.
