=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. First, let's understand the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney equation:
• It applies to a single-carrier device
• The device must be trap-free
• Contact conditions are important
• The current must be in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime

2. Let's analyze each option carefully:

A) This statement mentions:
• Single-carrier device ✓
• Ohmic contact ✓
• Negligible drift current ✓
• Trap-free condition ✓

B) This statement mentions:
• Single-carrier device ✓
• No carrier injection barrier ✓
• Negligible diffusion current ✓
• Trap-free condition ✓

C) This statement includes a Schottky contact, which implies a potential barrier at the contact
• This would interfere with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation

D) This mentions a two-carrier device, which contradicts the single-carrier assumption of the Mott-Gurney equation

3. Comparing the statements, options A and B are very similar, but option B includes an additional condition about "no carrier injection barrier"

4. The classical Mott-Gurney equation assumes an Ohmic contact and truly trap-free conditions

5. Option A most closely matches the standard assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation
