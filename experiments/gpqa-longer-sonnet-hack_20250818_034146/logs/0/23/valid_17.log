=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne as product C
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:17:30,492 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the molecular formulas and NMR data:
• A (C6H13Br): Suggests 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane
• B (C4H6): Suggests but-1-yne or but-2-yne
• C (C10H18): Product after reaction

2) NMR data:
• A: 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggests a branched alkyl bromide with different methylene/methyl groups
• B: 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet) suggests but-1-yne
• C: 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet) suggests a product with more complex structure

3) Reaction type:
• Given the molecular formulas and structures, this is likely a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction
• The alkyne acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromine

4) Analyzing the options:
• Option A is incorrect (nucleophilic addition)
• Option B matches our reasoning perfectly
• Option C is incorrect (electrophilic substitution)
• Option D has different reactants

Answer: B
