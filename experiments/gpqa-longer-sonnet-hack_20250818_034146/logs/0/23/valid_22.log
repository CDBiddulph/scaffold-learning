=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in bromination of the given benzene derivatives
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:17:37,127 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by considering the directing effects of each substituent in electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent classification:
• Activating and ortho/para directors:
- C6H5-CH3 (methyl group)
- C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl group)
• Deactivating and meta directors:
- C6H5-NO2 (nitro group)
• Deactivating and ortho/para directors:
- C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester)
- C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid)
• Deactivating and meta directors:
- C6H5-Cl (chloro group)

2) Analyzing para-directing strength:
• Methyl and ethyl groups strongly favor para position
• Carboxylic acid and ester weakly favor para
• Chloro slightly disfavors para
• Nitro strongly disfavors para

3) Weight fraction of para-isomer ranking from lowest to highest:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

The ranking matches option B.
