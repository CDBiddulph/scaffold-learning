1) First, let's understand what happens in the reaction
   • The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to reduction and deiodination
   • This means hydrogenation and removal of iodine will occur

2) Let's look at the starting molecule structure
   • It has a vinyl group (-CH=CH2)
   • It has an aldehyde group (-CHO)
   • It has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)
   • It has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond)

3) After reduction, what will the product look like?
   • The vinyl group becomes a saturated ethyl group
   • The aldehyde becomes an alcohol
   • The carboxylic acid remains
   • The cyclohexene ring becomes a fully saturated cyclohexane ring

4) Calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency
   • Recall: Index of hydrogen deficiency = Number of rings + Number of π bonds
   • Reduced structure has no π bonds
   • Reduced structure will have a saturated ring structure

5) Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1

6) This corresponds to option D
