=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:17:40,644 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) We are given that the wave function is:
   - Time independent
   - Spherically symmetric
   - Has zero imaginary part

2) The probability of finding the particle is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2, where Ψ(r) is the wave function

3) We're told that the probability is the same (P) in two shells:
   - First shell: between d1 and 2d1
   - Second shell: between 2d1 and 3d1

4) The volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr

5) If the probability is constant in these shells, then |Ψ(r)|^2 must compensate for the increasing shell volume

6) The total shell volume is proportional to (2d1)^3 - (d1)^3 for the first shell
   And (3d1)^3 - (2d1)^3 for the second shell

7) For the probabilities to be equal, |Ψ(r)|^2 * r^2 must be constant

8) This means |Ψ(r)| must be proportional to 1/r

9) The actual wave function would thus be Ψ(r) = C/r

Therefore, the wave function follows the form 1/r.
