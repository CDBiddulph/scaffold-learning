=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development, causing mosaicism

2025-08-18 11:17:30,081 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scientist injected three components into a 1-cell fertilized egg:
• Cas9 messenger RNA
• Guide RNA
• Donor DNA with a transgene

2. The resulting animal showed different genomic sequences in different cell lineages - a phenomenon known as mosaicism.

3. Key factors to consider:
• This happened during early embryo development
• The genome differs between cell types
• The modification occurred at a very early stage (1-cell stage)

4. Analysis of options:
• Option A: cDNA conversion is unlikely and not a typical mechanism
• Option B: Guide RNA-DNA complex incorporation is not a standard mechanism
• Option C: Surrogate mother DNA incorporation is not plausible
• Option D: This describes exactly how mosaicism can occur in gene editing

5. Explanation of Option D:
• If Cas9 continues to cut DNA at different developmental stages
• Each cell might get the donor DNA inserted at different times
• This leads to some cells having the modification and others not
• Result: Different genomic sequences in different cell lineages

6. This is a classic mechanism of genetic mosaicism in early embryo editing.
