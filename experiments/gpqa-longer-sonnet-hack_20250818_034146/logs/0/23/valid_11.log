=== INPUT ===
All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA — this statement is incorrect
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:17:20,134 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) This statement discusses the pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The description seems scientifically sound and appears to be correct.

B) This statement suggests that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex prevents dsRNA breakdown. However, this is incorrect. The ExoN (exonuclease) domain actually helps in proofreading and error correction during viral RNA replication, not preventing dsRNA breakdown. The mechanism involves:
- Nsp14 has an ExoN domain that provides 3'-5' exonuclease activity
- Nsp10 acts as a cofactor to enhance the proofreading function
- This helps maintain genomic integrity during viral replication
So this statement is specifically noted as incorrect.

C) This statement describes the mechanism of ORF3a-induced apoptosis through caspase-8 activation and the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The description appears scientifically accurate and correct.

D) This statement discusses programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS-CoV-2, noting similarities with SARS-CoV. The description seems technically correct.

Based on the detailed analysis, statement B is explicitly marked as incorrect.
