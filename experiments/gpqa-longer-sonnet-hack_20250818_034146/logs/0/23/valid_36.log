=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:17:56,509 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the localization precision:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a very large angular resolution
• This indicates the objects are likely relatively far away
• Precision of this scale suggests objects are not close to our solar system

2. Isotropy means uniform distribution in all directions

3. Evaluating the distance options:
A) 1 million to 1 billion light years
• These are intergalactic distances
• Consistent with large angular resolution
• Typical scale for extragalactic astronomical objects
• Would require satellites to detect very distant objects

B) 1 thousand to 100 thousand light years
• These are galactic and near-galactic distances
• Still consistent with the given precision
• Typical scale of objects within and near our Milky Way

C) 10 to 100 light years
• These are very local stellar neighborhood distances
• Such small distances would require much higher precision
• Not consistent with the large angular resolution

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
• These are extremely local, solar system scale distances
• Far too close to match the given localization precision

4. Conclusion: Option B best matches the description.
