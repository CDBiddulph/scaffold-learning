=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, recall the problem details:
   • Total decay probability in first 100 minutes = 32%
   • 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   • We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This suggests we're dealing with conditional probability

3) Let's calculate the probability of NOT decaying in the first 100 minutes
   • Probability of decay = 32%
   • Probability of no decay = 1 - 0.32 = 68%

4) We've now observed the atom survived 50 minutes without decaying
   • Original decay probability was over 100 minutes
   • So we need to recalculate the probability for the remaining time

5) Conditional probability calculation:
   • P(decay in next 150 minutes | survived first 50) 
   = 1 - P(no decay in next 150 minutes)
   = 1 - [P(no decay in first 100 minutes) / P(survived first 50 minutes)]

6) Calculation:
   • Probability of no decay in first 100 minutes = 0.68
   • Probability of surviving first 50 minutes = 1
   • Probability of decay in remaining time = 1 - 0.68 = 0.52 or 52%

7) Checking the options, 52% matches option C.
