What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-18 11:17:12,083 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given:
   KCa-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA] = 5 × 10¹⁰

3) Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M

4) Let x = concentration of free Ca²⁺ at equilibrium

5) Substituting into the equilibrium constant equation:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

6) Since KCa-EDTA is very large, we can assume x is much smaller than 0.02
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / 0.02

7) Solving for x:
   x² = 5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02
   x = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

8) This is the free Ca²⁺ concentration.
