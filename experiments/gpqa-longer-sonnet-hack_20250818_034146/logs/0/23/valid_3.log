1) First, let's understand density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• For a spherical planet, volume depends on radius

2) Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
• This will have exactly the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3) Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and density of 5.5 g/cm³
• The density is specified as 5.5 g/cm³
• This is the same as Earth's density

4) Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive
• If mass increases 5x but radius scales proportionally, the density remains the same
• Density would still be 5.5 g/cm³

5) Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass
• If mass decreases, but radius remains proportional, density stays constant
• Would still be 5.5 g/cm³

6) Key insight: Density depends on composition and how mass/radius scale together

7) All options have the same density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³

8) However, the question asks for "highest" density, and these are mathematically equivalent.

Since I must choose, I'll select the first option maintaining the standard Earth density.
