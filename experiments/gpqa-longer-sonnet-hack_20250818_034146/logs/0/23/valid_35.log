=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH in single cells
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:17:55,085 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Analysis Details:
- 50M cells used
- Strong interaction signal between promoter and enhancer
- Linear distance of ~1 Mb
- Highly significant statistical signal

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not validate the interaction
- This suggests the interaction might not be consistently detectable at single-cell resolution

3. Additional Evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional relationship between the promoter and enhancer
- Suggests the interaction signal is not completely a false positive

4. Potential Explanations:
- Option A suggests the interaction might be too weak/rare to consistently detect in individual cells
- Hi-C averages signals across millions of cells, smoothing out interaction frequencies
- FISH looks at single-cell interactions, which could miss rare/transient contacts
- The functional effect of KRAB suggests a real, albeit subtle, interaction mechanism

5. Ruling Out Other Options:
- Option B (structural variation) is not well-supported
- Option C (interaction too short) doesn't make sense given the 1 Mb distance
- Option D (complete false positive) is contradicted by the functional evidence

Based on this reasoning, the most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH in single cells.
