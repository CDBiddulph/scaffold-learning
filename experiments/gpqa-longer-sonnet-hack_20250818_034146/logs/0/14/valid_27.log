=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25 is the expectation value of S_y

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:06:04,618 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin is calculated as ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ† * σ_y * ψ

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]

3) We need to calculate ψ†...
