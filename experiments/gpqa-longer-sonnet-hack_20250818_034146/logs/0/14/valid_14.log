=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:43,228 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges:
   U = k(q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²)

2) Charges:
