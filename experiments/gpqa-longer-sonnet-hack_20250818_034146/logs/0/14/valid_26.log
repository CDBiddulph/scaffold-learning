=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K is the order of magnitude of the black hole entropy

2025-08-18 11:06:01,187 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relation between angular size θ, black hole radius R, and distance d:
   θ = R/d (in radians)

2) We're given:
   • d = 10^10 parsecs
   • θ = 10^-...
