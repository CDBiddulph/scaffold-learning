=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm is the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction
C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm


Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:05:30,230 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum scattering theory, the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction (f(0)) relates to phase shifts via the partial wave expansion.

2) The imagi...
