=== INPUT ===
S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one is the structure of product 4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
