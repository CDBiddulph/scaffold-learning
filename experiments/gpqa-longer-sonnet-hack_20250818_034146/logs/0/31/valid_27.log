=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25 is the expectation value of S_y

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:28:25,324 [INFO] Attempt 1 response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin is calculated as:
   ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ†(σ_y)ψ

2) Our state vector ψ is (3i, 4)

3) σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \e...

2025-08-18 11:28:30,832 [INFO] Attempt 2 response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)
   • This means the state vector is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)

2) The expectation value of S_y is calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩

3) First, calculate...

2025-08-18 11:28:36,574 [INFO] Attempt 3 response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the state vector and ψ† is its conjugate transpose.

2) The given state ve...
