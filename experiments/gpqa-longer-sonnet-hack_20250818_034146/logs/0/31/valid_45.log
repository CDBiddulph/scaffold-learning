=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3% mass fraction of HHal acid in the resulting products
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:29:11,264 [INFO] Attempt 1 response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's define the volumes:
• Let x be the volume of A
• Then, the volume of B is also x
• The volume of C is 2.25(x+x) = 2.25(2x)

2) Volume ratio of (A+B):C i...

2025-08-18 11:29:17,640 [INFO] Attempt 2 response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's define the initial volumes:
   • Let A = 1 volume unit
   • Let B = 1 volume unit
   • Let C = 2.25 volume units

2) Their densities differ by a factor ...

2025-08-18 11:29:24,001 [INFO] Attempt 3 response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) First, let's understand the initial mixture:
• Initial ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
• A:B = 1:1 volume ratio
• Total initial volume A and B = 1 part
• Volume of C = 2...
