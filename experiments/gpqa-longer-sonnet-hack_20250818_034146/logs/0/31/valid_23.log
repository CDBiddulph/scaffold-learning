Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-18 11:28:19,086 [INFO] Attempt 1 response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation: 
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log(distance/10 parsecs)

2) Option A: 
   - Distance is 20 parsecs
   -...

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log10(distance in parsecs) - 5

2) For an apparent magnitude V = 7 at 50 ...
