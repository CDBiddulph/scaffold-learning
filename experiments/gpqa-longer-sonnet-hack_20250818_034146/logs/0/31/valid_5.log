=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm is the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction
C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

1) For elastic scattering, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts by the formula:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑(2l+1) sin(2δl)

2025-08-18 11:27:46,094 [INFO] Attempt 3 response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δl) / (2)

   Where k is the wave number, l ...
