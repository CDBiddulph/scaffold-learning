=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:07:29,023 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the context:
• Satellites in low Earth orbit are detecting astronomical objects
• They have localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Consider the localization precision:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular area
• This suggests the objects are quite distant

3. Evaluate the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years - These are extremely large cosmic distances
B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years - These are within our galaxy's scale
C) 10 or 100 light years - These are very close, near-stellar distances
D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds - These are very small, solar system scale distances

4. Analysis of precision and scale:
• The localization precision implies these are distant objects
• The objects are likely in intergalactic or galactic scales
• This rules out very close (option C) and very small (option D) distances

5. Conclusion:
• Option B (1 thousand to 100 thousand light years) is most consistent with the description
• These distances correspond to objects within or near our Milky Way galaxy
