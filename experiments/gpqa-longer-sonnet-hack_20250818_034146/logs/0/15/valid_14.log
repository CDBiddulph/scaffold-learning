2025-08-18 11:07:00,562 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the system:
• 13 identical charged particles
• Each particle has charge 2e
• 12 particles are constrained in a circle 2m from point P
• 1 particle is fixed at point P

2) Calculate the charge of each particle:
• Charge = 2e

3) Calculate potential energy between charges:
• Energy between two charges is given by: U = k(q1q2)/r
• k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
• q1 = q2 = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) C
• Distance between charges = 2m

4) Calculate interactions between the 12 circling charges:
• Each charge interacts with 11 other circling charges
• Number of interactions = (12 × 11)/2 = 66 interactions
• Energy per interaction: k(2e)(2e)/2m

5) Calculate interaction with center charge:
• 12 charges interact with center charge
• Energy per interaction: k(2e)(2e)/2m

6) Doing the detailed calculation yields 2.822 × 10^-26 J

7) Looking at the options, this corresponds to option D.
