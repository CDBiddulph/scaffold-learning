=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up because the reaction is equilibrium-limited under the conditions used
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:07:37,443 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key Information:
- The student has performed a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300°C
- Current conversion is not satisfactory
- Catalyst modifications haven't changed the reactor exit composition

2. Understanding the Problem:
- The reaction seems to be equilibrium-limited
- The student needs to improve conversion without losing selectivity

3. Analysis of Options:
A) Accepting results and stopping experiments is not a productive solution
B) Decreasing temperature might help shift equilibrium, but lacks awareness of potential side reactions
C) Decreasing temperature with awareness of potential polymerization is a cautious approach
D) Increasing temperature would likely shift equilibrium in the wrong direction and potentially cause more side reactions

4. Reasoning for C:
- Lowering temperature can:
  - Shift chemical equilibrium
  - Potentially improve conversion
  - Reduce side reaction rates
- The caution about polymerization shows understanding of potential chemical complications
- Increasing catalyst amount might help overcome mass transfer limitations

5. Conclusion:
Option C provides the most scientifically sound and nuanced approach to addressing the conversion challenge.
