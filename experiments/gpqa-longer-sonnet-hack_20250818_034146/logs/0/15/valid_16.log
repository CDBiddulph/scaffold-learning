=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development, causing mosaicism

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:07:03,635 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what happened:
• The scientist performed genetic modification on a 1-cell fertilized egg
• Used Cas9 mRNA, guide RNA, and donor DNA
• The resulting animal had different genomes in different cell lineages

2. Key concept here is "mosaicism" - where different cells in the same organism have different genetic compositions

3. Analyzing the options:
• Option A suggests cDNA incorporation, which is unlikely
• Option B suggests guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation, which also seems improbable
• Option C introduces an unsubstantiated claim about surrogate mother's DNA, which seems implausible
• Option D describes the most scientifically sound mechanism

4. Detailed reasoning for Option D:
• CRISPR-Cas9 works by creating DNA breaks
• If Cas9 continues to be active during early embryo development
• It could cut DNA at different stages, allowing donor DNA insertion
• This would lead to some cells having the modification and others not
• Result would be genetic mosaicism across different tissue lineages

5. The explanation in Option D precisely matches the observation of different genomes in different cell lineages
