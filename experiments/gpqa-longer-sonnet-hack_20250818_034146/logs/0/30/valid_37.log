=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137 is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
