=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's consider the decay of Caesium-137:
- Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
- This means the radioactive decay rate is relatively slow

2) Calculate the ...
