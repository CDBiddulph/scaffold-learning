=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be Î¸=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K is the order of magnitude of the black hole entropy
D) 10^65 J/K

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
