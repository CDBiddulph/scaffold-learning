=== INPUT ===
In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators to achieve regular branching in a polymer made only from ethylene
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:31,257 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll examine each statement's scientific accuracy:

2. Regarding statement A: 
- Dual catalyst systems for polyethylene with precise branching are indeed industrially implemented in the US
- This appears to be a scientifically accurate statement

3. Statement B:
- Aluminum-based activators are actually commonly used in polymerization reactions
- This statement seems incorrect

4. Statement C:
- Group VIa transition metals (like tungsten or molybdenum) are not typically used for precise polyethylene branching
- The description of achieving regular branching seems imprecise
- This statement looks dubious

5. Statement D:
- Noble metal catalysts (like platinum or palladium) are expensive for large-scale polymer production
- However, this doesn't relate directly to the ability to create branched polyethylene
- This statement is partially true but not most relevant to the technical question

6. After careful analysis, statement A stands out as the most accurate, scientifically verifiable statement.
