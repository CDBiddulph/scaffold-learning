=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:16,110 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The key information is localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes for isotropically distributed astronomical objects.

2. Arc minutes relate to angular measurement, which implies the objects could be at varying distances.

3. Let's evaluate the distance scales:
• 10 light minutes/seconds is extremely close (within solar system) - too small
• 10-100 light years is local stellar neighborhood - too small
• 1000-100,000 light years would cover our galaxy - reasonable
• 1 million-1 billion light years covers large cosmic scales - also reasonable

4. The distribution is described as isotropic, meaning uniform in all directions.

5. The distances in option B (1 thousand to 100 thousand light years) best match:
• Scale of Milky Way galaxy
• Consistent with astronomical observations
• Compatible with localization precision

6. The precision of 100-200 arc minutes suggests these are relatively distant, but not intergalactic objects.

Therefore, after systematic scientific reasoning, the most appropriate distance range is in option B.
