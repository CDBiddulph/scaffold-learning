=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:59:44,201 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the power of the coupling constant.

2. In the given expression, we see alpha^3 * g^2, which suggests multiple power-dependent terms.

3. The key step is to count the number of loop factors, which contribute to the loop power.

4. The 1/(4pi)^6 term is critical: the power of 6 in the denominator suggests multiple loop contributions.

5. Specifically, for Feynman diagrams, the denominator's power (6) directly indicates the number of loops.

6. By convention, 1/(4pi)^6 corresponds to a 3-loop diagram.

7. The other terms (alpha^3, g^2, sqrt(2), 8, (Q/M)^2) do not change this fundamental loop count.

8. Therefore, the diagram contained 3 loops.
