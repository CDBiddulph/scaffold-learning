=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25Â°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V is the resulting redox potential of the solution
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 11:00:10,033 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, the standard redox potential for Fe(III)/Fe(II) is 0.77 V.

2) The Nernst equation will help us calculate the actual redox potential:
   E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

3) We have equal concentrations of Fe(II) and Fe(III) at 0.01 M each.

4) However, the presence of phosphate will affect the iron ion concentrations due to complex formation.

5) The complex formation constant of Fe(III)-H2PO4^- is 10^21, which is extremely high.

6) This means most Fe(III) will form a complex with phosphate, effectively reducing free Fe(III) concentration.

7) The reduced free Fe(III) concentration will shift the redox potential.

8) Using the Nernst equation and considering the complex formation, the redox potential will decrease.

9) By careful calculation and considering all given parameters, the resulting redox potential comes out to be -0.34 V.

10) This matches option A.
