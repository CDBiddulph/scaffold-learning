You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG are the forward and reverse primers
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:24,706 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, identify the cloning sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS):
- HindIII
- KpnI
- BamHI

2. Analyze the sequence and desired cloning strategy:
- We want to clone the sequence directionally
- Need primers that introduce the correct restriction sites

3. Check the given primer sequences:
- They introduce HindIII (AAGCTT) and KpnI (GGTACC) sites
- Forward primer starts with start codon ATG
- Reverse primer introduces complementary site at end of sequence

4. Match these restriction sites to the vector's MCS:
- HindIII is in the MCS
- KpnI is in the MCS
- These will allow directional cloning

5. Verify primer design:
- Forward primer introduces HindIII at 5' end
- Reverse primer introduces KpnI at 3' end
- Will ensure correct orientation for expression

6. Check this against the options and find the matching pair.

The key criteria are met by option A.
