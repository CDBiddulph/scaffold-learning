2025-08-18 10:59:29,810 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume.

2. Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³).

3. Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³ means its volume would be proportionally larger.

4. Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive would have a larger radius, but not proportionally 5 times larger.
   - If mass increases 5 times and composition is the same, the radius would increase less than 5 times.
   - This means the volume would be smaller relative to the mass increase.
   - Result: Higher density than original Earth density.

5. Option d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass would have a smaller radius and compressed structure.
   - This would result in a density higher than Earth's average density.

6. Comparing these, option c) would have the highest density.
