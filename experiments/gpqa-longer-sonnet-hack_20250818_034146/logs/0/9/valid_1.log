=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:59:29,064 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, consider Caesium-137's properties:
- Half-life is about 30 years
- Emits gamma radiation during decay
- High number of atoms: 10^17

2. Calculate decay rate:
- In 80 minutes, the decay will be relatively small
- Most atoms will still be intact

3. Typical gamma ray emission characteristics:
- Each decaying Cs-137 atom emits multiple gamma rays
- Roughly 0.85 gamma rays per disintegration
- Detection efficiency of a perfect detector is near 100%

4. Estimate gamma ray detection:
- With 10^17 atoms, significant number of decays occur
- Probabilistic estimation suggests millions of gamma rays
- Detector size and distance will impact total detected rays

5. Assess the options:
- 10^2 (100) is far too low
- 10^4 (10,000) is too small
- 10^8 (100 million) seems excessive
- 10^6 (1 million) matches expected range of detection

Therefore, the most scientifically reasonable estimate is 1 million gamma-rays detected.
