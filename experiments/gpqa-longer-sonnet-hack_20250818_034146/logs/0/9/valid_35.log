=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH in single cells
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:16,035 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Results:
- Detected a significant interaction between promoter and enhancer
- Distance between them is ~1 Mb
- Interaction found when using 50M cells

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not validate the interaction

3. Additional Evidence:
- Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This suggests a real functional interaction exists

4. Analyzing Potential Reasons:
- A) Low interaction frequency in single cells is plausible
- Hi-C averages signals across many cells
- FISH looks at individual cells, which might miss rare interactions
- The subtle effect of KRAB (20% reduction) suggests a weak but real interaction

5. Eliminating Other Options:
- B) No evidence of structural variation
- C) 1 Mb distance seems reasonable for FISH
- D) dCas9-KRAB effect argues against a complete false positive

6. Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction is present but rare, making it difficult to detect consistently in single cells by FISH.
