=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25 is the expectation value of S_y

2025-08-18 11:00:02,019 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)
   - This means the state vector is [3i, 4]

2) The expectation value of S_y is calculated as:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

3) σ_y matrix is \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

4) First, calculate ψ†:
   ψ† = [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]

5) Multiply ψ† σ_y ψ:
   = [-3i, 4] \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} [3i, 4]
   = [-3i * 0 + 4 * i, -3i * (-i) + 4 * 0]
   = [4i, 3]

6) Final step, calculate the dot product:
   = -12/25 * hbar

7) This matches answer choice D.
