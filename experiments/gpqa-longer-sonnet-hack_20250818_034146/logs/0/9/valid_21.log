S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one is the structure of product 4

2025-08-18 10:59:53,977 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S to 1):
- tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine will protect the hydroxyl group with a TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl) group
- This stabilizes the hydroxyl and prepares for subsequent reactions

2) Second reaction (1 to 2):
- Ph2CuLi (organocuprate) is used for carbon-carbon bond formation
- Low temperature helps control stereochemistry
- Followed by benzyl bromide introduces a benzyl group

3) Third reaction (2 to 3):
- LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) deprotonates at the Î±-position
- Iodomethane adds a methyl group
- This creates a new stereocenter

4) Final reaction (3 to 4):
- Aqueous HCl removes the TBS group
- Restores the hydroxyl group
- Involves stereochemistry considerations

Carefully analyzing the stereochemistry and transformations, the structure with the correct stereochemical configuration is:
