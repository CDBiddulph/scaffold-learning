2025-08-18 10:59:30,795 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We're given a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex and the stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5x10^10.

2) The equilibrium reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

3) The stability constant is defined as: K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

4) We know the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.

5) We can rearrange the stability constant equation to solve for [Ca²⁺]:
   [Ca²⁺] = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / (K[EDTA⁴⁻])

6) Substituting the known values and rearranging:
   [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 / (5x10^10)

7) Calculating this gives: 
   [Ca²⁺] = 4x10^-12 / 5x10^10 = 6.3x10^-7 M

8) This matches exactly with option B.
