2025-08-18 11:00:20,009 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The question asks about the color of light absorbed by the dye, given its emission energy of 2.3393 eV.

2. First, recall the relationship between energy and wavelength (color):
   • Higher energy = Shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
   • Lower energy = Longer wavelength (red/yellow end of spectrum)

3. The emission energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to a wavelength in the visible spectrum.

4. When a substance emits light of a specific color, it typically absorbs the complementary (opposite) color.

5. Converting 2.3393 eV to wavelength shows this corresponds to approximately 530 nm (green-yellow region).

6. The complementary color to green-yellow is violet/blue.

7. Therefore, the textile dye is absorbing blue light.

8. The complementary color absorbed is blue, which corresponds to option A.
