=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-18 10:59:48,533 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the orbital period relationship with temperature and mass:
   - Equilibrium temperature depends on orbital distance and stellar properties
   - Orbital period is related to orbital radius via Kepler's Third Law

2) Temperature ratio information:
   - Planet1/Planet2 temperature ratio = 1.4
   - Planet2/Planet3 temperature ratio = 2.3

3) Mass ratio information:
   - Planet1/Planet2 mass ratio = 1.15
   - Planet2/Planet3 mass ratio = 1.35

4) Temperature is proportional to 1/âˆš(orbital radius)
   - Temperature ratio suggests orbital radius differences

5) Orbital period is proportional to (orbital radius)^(3/2)

6) Combining temperature and mass information suggests the orbital period relationship

7) The key is to find the orbital period difference between Planet3 and Planet1

8) By carefully analyzing the given ratios, the orbital period of Planet3 appears to be about 10.4 times larger than Planet1's orbital period

9) The equal albedo (0.3) confirms the relationship is consistent

Therefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 10.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
