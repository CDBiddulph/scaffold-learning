=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle, since the C-NOT here flips the target when the control is \left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 10:59:30,588 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, recall how a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate works:
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit is flipped
   • If the control qubit is |1⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit

2) In this input state |ψ⟩, the input is:
   (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

3) The control qubit is |0⟩, so the C-NOT gate will flip the target qubit

4) However, the first part of the state (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) remains unchanged

5) When the target qubit is flipped from |0⟩, it becomes |1⟩

6) Therefore, the output will have the same first part but with the second qubit changed from |0⟩ to |1⟩

7) This matches option B exactly
