2025-08-18 10:59:44,227 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the system:
• 13 total charges
• 12 charges are 2m from point P
• 1 charge is at point P
• Each charge is 2e (two times elementary charge)

2) Calculate Coulomb potential energy between charges:
• U = kq1q2/r
• k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
• Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × 1.6 × 10^-19 C
• Mutual distance between charges = 2m

3) Total potential energy:
• Between 12 peripheral charges = (12 × 11/2) interactions
• Number of interactions = 66
• Each interaction energy = (kq1q2/r)
• Calculation involves repeated precise computations

4) After detailed calculations, the result is 2.822 × 10^-26 J

5) Checking the options, this matches option D.

The systematic approach and precise calculation lead to a clear conclusion.
