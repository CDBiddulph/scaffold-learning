=== INPUT ===
All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA — this statement is incorrect
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:59:42,060 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Option A: Discusses frameshifting mechanism and pseudoknots. The statement appears scientifically accurate about SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, so this is likely CORRECT.

2. Option B: Discusses nsp10/nsp14-ExoN. The statement suggests that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN prevents dsRNA breakdown, which is INCORRECT. In reality, this complex functions in proofreading and error correction during viral RNA replication.

3. Option C: Describes ORF3a's role in apoptosis through caspase-8 activation. This appears to be a scientifically valid description of the mechanism, so this statement is CORRECT.

4. Option D: Explains programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The statement about similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting appears accurate, so this is likely CORRECT.

The question asks for the EXCEPTION (incorrect statement), which is Option B.

The key is that the statement in Option B is scientifically inaccurate about the function of the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex.
