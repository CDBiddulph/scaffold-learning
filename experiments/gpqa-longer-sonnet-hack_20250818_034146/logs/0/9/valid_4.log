=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:59:30,859 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the initial decay probability:
• 32% decay chance within 100 minutes
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay

2. Calculate the remaining probability after 50 minutes:
• If 32% decays in 100 minutes, then probability of survival is 68%
• After 50 minutes (half the time), the survival probability changes

3. Use conditional probability reasoning:
• The fact that the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes means we're now conditional on its survival
• This means the decay probability for the remaining time must be adjusted

4. Calculation:
• The new total time window is 150 minutes
• Original decay probability was 32% for 100 minutes
• Proportionally scaling this to 150 minutes increases the probability
• This gives approximately 48% chance of decay in the remaining 150 minutes

5. Checking the options, 48% matches option A.
