=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:59:48,087 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key characteristics of the Mott-Gurney equation:
- It describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
- Applies to single-carrier transport
- Assumes specific device conditions

2. The equation requires:
- A single carrier type (not two-carrier)
- No significant injection barriers
- Negligible diffusion current
- Ohmic contacts

3. Let's analyze each option:
- Option A matches ALL these requirements precisely
- Option B is close but incorrectly specifies "no carrier injection barrier"
- Option C introduces a Schottky contact, which would alter the current behavior
- Option D incorrectly suggests a two-carrier device

4. The Mott-Gurney equation fundamentally assumes:
- A trap-free semiconductor
- Single carrier transport
- Ohmic contacts
- Voltage-dependent current scaling with V²/L³

5. Carefully comparing the requirements with the given options, option A is the most accurate description of the Mott-Gurney equation's validity conditions.
