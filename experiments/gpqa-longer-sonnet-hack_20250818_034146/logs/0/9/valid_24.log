=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 10:59:59,440 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- zeta: 0.96c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 2,880m
- eta: 0.9c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 2,700m
- chi: 0.88c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 2,640m
- lambda: 0.93c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 2,790m

2. Compare these distances to ground level (13,000m):
- zeta reaches: 2,880m (10,120m short)
- eta reaches: 2,700m (10,300m short)
- chi reaches: 2,640m (10,360m short)
- lambda reaches: 2,790m (10,210m short)

3. None reach the ground. Order is based on distance traveled.

4. Order from most distance to least: zeta > lambda > eta > chi
