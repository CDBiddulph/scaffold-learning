=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference for multi-Higgs-doublet models

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:30,432 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Multi-Higgs-doublet models are extensions of the Standard Model with additional Higgs doublets.

2. Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) are sensitive to quantum corrections in electroweak precision tests.

3. Breit-Wigner corrections account for resonance effects in particle interactions.

4. For multi-Higgs-doublet models, the charged scalar masses significantly impact the precision of these corrections.

5. The constraints on New Physics depend sensitively on how accurately these corrections capture the physics.

6. Research shows that for multi-Higgs-doublet models, the Breit-Wigner corrections can provide more nuanced constraints that depend specifically on the charged scalar mass spectrum.

7. This means the constraint quality is not uniform but varies with the specific model parameters.

8. Therefore, the answer that best captures this complexity is that the improvements depend on the masses of the charged scalars.
