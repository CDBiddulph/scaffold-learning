=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up because the reaction is equilibrium-limited under the conditions used
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:22,902 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The student has conducted a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300°C.

2. The goal is to increase reactant conversion without compromising selectivity.

3. The student has already tried changing catalyst amount/composition, but the exit composition remains unchanged.

4. This suggests the reaction is at thermodynamic equilibrium.

5. To improve conversion in an equilibrium-limited reaction, standard strategies include:
- Changing temperature
- Adding/removing products
- Shifting reaction conditions

6. Le Chatelier's principle indicates that lowering temperature can shift equilibrium towards product formation.

7. However, the question warns about potential polymerization at lower temperatures.

8. Option B suggests lowering temperature and increasing catalyst amount.

9. Option C is identical to B but adds a warning about polymerization.

10. The warning about polymerization makes Option C more comprehensive and scientifically cautious.

11. Option C provides a nuanced approach that:
- Attempts to improve conversion
- Maintains awareness of potential side reactions
- Shows careful scientific consideration

Therefore, the most scientifically sound approach is Option C.
