=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory

2025-08-18 11:00:20,236 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the principles of relativistic velocity addition:
   - When an object moves through a medium, the observed speed is affected by both the medium's refractive index and the medium's velocity

2) The standard relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   (u + v) / (1 + u*v/c^2)

3) In this case:
   - u is the speed of light in the glass (1/n)
   - v is the velocity of the glass
   - c is the speed of light in vacuum (given as 1)

4) Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:
   ((1/n) + v) / (1 + ((1/n)*v)/1)

5) Simplifying this algebraically gives:
   (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

6) This matches option D exactly.

7) Let's verify:
   - The numerator represents the combined effect of the light speed in glass and the glass's velocity
   - The denominator adjusts for relativistic effects
   - When v = 0, the speed reduces to 1/n (speed of light in glass)

8) Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
