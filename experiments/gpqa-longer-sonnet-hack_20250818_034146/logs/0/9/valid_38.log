2025-08-18 11:00:17,404 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that involves the migration of a vinyl group.

2) In this molecule, we have a 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene structure.

3) During Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group will migrate to a new position, breaking and forming new bonds.

4) The key considerations are:
   - The nitrogen remains part of the ring
   - The vinyl group moves to a new position
   - The ring structure is maintained

5) By carefully tracking the bond changes, the product will have:
   - A 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro substitution pattern
   - A cyclopenta[c]pyridine ring system
   - 3H in the ring nomenclature

6) This matches the structure described in option C.

7) Checking the other options, only C precisely describes the expected product.
