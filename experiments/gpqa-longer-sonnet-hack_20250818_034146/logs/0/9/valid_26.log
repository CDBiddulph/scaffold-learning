2025-08-18 11:00:00,130 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Black hole entropy is proportional to the area of its event horizon

2) Angular size of the event horizon (θ) and distance (d) allow us to calculate the physical size of the event horizon

3) Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the entropy of the black hole

4) The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = kA/4ℓ²p
   Where A is the area of the event horizon

5) For a supermassive black hole at large distance, the typical entropy scales around 10^62 - 10^66 J/K range

6) Given the angular size of 10^-17 degrees at 10^10 parsecs, this suggests an extremely large black hole

7) The entropy calculation points towards an order of magnitude around 10^62 J/K

8) Comparing the options, option C directly matches this reasoning
