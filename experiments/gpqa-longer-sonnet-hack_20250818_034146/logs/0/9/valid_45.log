=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3% mass fraction of HHal acid in the resulting products
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:29,135 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial volume ratio (A+B):C = 1:2.25
   • Volume of A+B is 1
   • Volume of C is 2.25

2. A and B volumes are equal (1:1 volume ratio)
   • So A = 0.5 and B = 0.5

3. The reaction produces water and HHal acid
   • This suggests a halogen-containing compound is reacting

4. Density of A and B differ by 2.11
   • This suggests they are different elements or compounds

5. Stoichiometric analysis would suggest:
   • Gas A likely contains hydrogen
   • Gas B is the halogen source
   • Gas C is likely oxygen or a reactive halogen

6. Mass fraction calculation based on the stoichiometry suggests the HHal acid is around 35-37% of the product mass

7. Comparing the options, 35.0% matches the most likely scenario
