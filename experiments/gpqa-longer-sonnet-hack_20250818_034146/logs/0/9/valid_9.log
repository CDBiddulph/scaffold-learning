2025-08-18 10:59:29,357 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
- Contains a ring
- Has a double bond in the ring
- Contains a vinyl group
- Contains a formyl group
- Contains a carboxylic acid group

2. The reaction involves red phosphorus and excess HI:
- Red phosphorus helps in reducing the molecule
- Excess HI will:
  * Remove the formyl group
  * Reduce the carboxylic acid group
  * Potentially remove the vinyl group
  * Break some ring bonds

3. After the reaction, calculate the hydrogen deficiency:
- Number of rings after reaction
- Remaining double bonds
- Rings and double bonds contribute to hydrogen deficiency

4. Carefully counting the rings and double bonds in the product will reveal the index of hydrogen deficiency

5. After careful analysis, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1

Therefore, the answer is:
