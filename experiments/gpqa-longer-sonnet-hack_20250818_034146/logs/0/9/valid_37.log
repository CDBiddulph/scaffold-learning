=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137 is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:00:15,894 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we're talking about the smallest charge and mass at the quantum scale.

2. The smallest quantum of charge is the elementary charge (electron charge), around 1.6 x 10^-19 Coulombs.

3. The distance is 137 meters.

4. This likely refers to the relationship between electromagnetic and gravitational forces.

5. The key insight is the weakness of gravitational force compared to electromagnetic force.

6. The ratio of forces typically scales with distance, specifically 1/r^2.

7. In this case, the ratio of force strengths would be 1/137^2.

8. This is because the force strength drops off quadratically with distance.

9. Looking at the given options, this corresponds exactly to option C.

The ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength is 1/137^2.
