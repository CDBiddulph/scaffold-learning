A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:00:03,964 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. An optically active molecule requires:
- A carbon chain with at least one chiral center
- Asymmetry in the molecule's structure

2. Analyze the composition data:
- All options show similar carbon and hydrogen percentages
- This suggests similar molecular formulas

3. Check molecular weights via EI-MS peaks:
- Option A: m/z 72 suggests C5H12
- Option B: m/z 86 suggests C6H14
- Option C: m/z 58 suggests C4H10
- Option D: m/z 100 suggests C7H16

4. Determine chirality potential:
- Option A (C5H12): Possible chiral center at middle carbon
- Option B (C6H14): Possible chiral centers at multiple positions
- Option C (C4H10): Insufficient complexity for chirality
- Option D (C7H16): Multiple potential chiral centers

5. Option B provides the most likely scenario for optical activity due to its molecular structure and potential for asymmetric carbon centers.
