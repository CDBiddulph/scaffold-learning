=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 10:59:59,487 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. We're looking for a wave function where the probability density is the same for two specific shells from the center.

2. The shells are from d1 to 2d1 and from 2d1 to 3d1.

3. Probability is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2, where Ψ(r) is the wave function.

4. For the probabilities to be equal, the integral of |Ψ(r)|^2 over each shell must be the same.

5. First shell volume: 4π(2d1)^3 - 4π(d1)^3
   Second shell volume: 4π(3d1)^3 - 4π(2d1)^3

6. If Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r, then |Ψ(r)|^2 ∝ 1/r^2

7. This means the probability per unit volume will be constant across these shells.

8. This leads to equal probability P in the specified shells.

Therefore, the wave function is proportional to 1/r.
