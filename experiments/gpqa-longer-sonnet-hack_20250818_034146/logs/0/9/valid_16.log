=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development, causing mosaicism

2025-08-18 10:59:46,946 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scenario describes a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing experiment in a 1-cell fertilized egg.

2. The key observation is that different cell lineages in the final transgenic animal have different genomic sequences.

3. This suggests that gene editing did not occur uniformly during early embryonic development.

4. This non-uniform genetic modification is known scientifically as "mosaicism".

5. Option A is incorrect - cDNA conversion is not the mechanism here.

6. Option B is incorrect - the guide RNA-donor DNA complex is not the cause of differential genome changes.

7. Option C is incorrect - there's no evidence of surrogate mother DNA contamination.

8. Option D correctly describes the mechanism: The Cas9 protein continues to be active during early embryo development, potentially cutting DNA and incorporating donor DNA at different stages, leading to different genetic modifications in different cell lineages.

9. This creates a mosaic pattern of genetic changes across the developing embryo.

The key mechanism here is ongoing CRISPR-Cas9 activity during early embryonic cell divisions, causing variable genetic modifications.
