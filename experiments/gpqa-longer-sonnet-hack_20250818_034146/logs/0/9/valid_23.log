a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-18 10:59:57,616 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Recall the magnitude equation: Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 * log10(distance/10 parsecs)

2. For single stars:
   a) 7 mag at 50 parsecs: No calculation needed
   b) 7 mag at 20 parsecs: Close, but not closest
   d) Absolute magnitude of 7 at 10 parsecs will have 7 apparent magnitude

3. For two-star systems, we need to calculate combined magnitude:
   Combined magnitude = -2.5 * log10(10^(-0.4*mag1) + 10^(-0.4*mag2))

4. For c) Two stars at 5 parsecs:
   Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8
   When stars are close together, both contribute significantly

5. Comparing systematically, the system with stars at 5 parsecs will appear brightest due to proximity

6. Calculating combined magnitude for system c):
   Combined apparent magnitude will be brighter than other options
