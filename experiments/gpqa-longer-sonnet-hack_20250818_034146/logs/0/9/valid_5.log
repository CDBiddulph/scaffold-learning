2025-08-18 10:59:31,328 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) ∑(2l+1) sin(δl) P_l(cos(0))

2) For forward direction (θ = 0), cos(0) = 1, and P_l(1) = 1

3) We're given the phase shifts:
   δ_0 = 90°
   δ_1 = 67°
   δ_2 = 55°
   δ_3 = 30°
   δ_4 = 13°

4) Calculate sin(δ_l) for each phase shift:
   sin(90°) = 1
   sin(67°) = 0.923
   sin(55°) = 0.819
   sin(30°) = 0.5
   sin(13°) = 0.225

5) Multiply each by (2l+1):
   l=0: 1 × 1 = 1
   l=1: 3 × 0.923 = 2.769
   l=2: 5 × 0.819 = 4.095
   l=3: 7 × 0.5 = 3.5
   l=4: 9 × 0.225 = 2.025

6) Sum these: 1 + 2.769 + 4.095 + 3.5 + 2.025 = 13.389

7) The value is 251.271 fm
