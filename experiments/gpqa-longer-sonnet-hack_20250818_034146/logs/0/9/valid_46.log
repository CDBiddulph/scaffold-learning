=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 11:00:30,275 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   Temperature ∝ Peak Photon Energy

2) For star A, peak energy = 7.21 eV
   For the sun, peak energy = 1.41 eV

3) Ratio of temperatures = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity is related to radius and temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴

5) We're told star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

6) If T increases by 5.11, and L increases by 24, then:
   R² × (5.11)⁴ = 24

7) Solve for R:
   R = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   R = √(24 / 672.43)
   R = √(0.0357)
   R = 0.19

8) This corresponds to 0.19 times the sun's radius
