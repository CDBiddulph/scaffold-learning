=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference for multi-Higgs-doublet models

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
