=== INPUT ===
Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-18 12:04:01,637 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus formula:
m = M + 5 log(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs.

2) Option a: 
- Already given apparent magnitude: 7 mag
- Distance: 50 parsecs

3) Option b:
- Already given apparent magnitude: 7 mag
- Distance: 20 parsecs
- Closer distance means brighter star

4) Option c:
- Two stars with Vmag 7 and 8 at 5 parsecs
- Will need to calculate combined apparent magnitude
- Combi...
