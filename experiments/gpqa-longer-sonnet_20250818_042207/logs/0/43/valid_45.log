=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3% mass fraction of HHal acid in the resulting products
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's understand the initial composition:
• Total initial volume of (A+B) : C = 1 : 2.25
• A : B = 1 : 1

2) Let's represent volumes:
• A = 0.5 total (A+B) volume
• B = 0.5 total (A+B) volume
• C = 2.25 total (A+B) volume

3) Density condition: ρ(A) = 2.11 × ρ(B)

4) Let's assume the densities have a mass relationship. This suggests A is likely hydrogen, B is a halogen, and C is probably another halogen.

5) Given the 1:1 volume ratio of A and B, the mas...
