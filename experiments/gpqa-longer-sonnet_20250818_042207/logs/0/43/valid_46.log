=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law: λmax * T = constant
   This means that peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature

2) Peak energy (E) is related to temperature (T) by E = kT
   So if energy peaks at different values, temperatures will differ

3) Peak energy for sun: 1.41 eV
   Peak energy for star A: 7.21 eV

4) Temperature ratio: T(A) / T(sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

5) The luminosity (L) of a star depends on radius (R) and temperature (T) b...
