The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K is the order of magnitude of the black hole entropy

2025-08-18 12:04:02,328 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the angular size of a black hole's event horizon:
   θ = 2 * Schwarzschild radius / distance

2) Rearrange the formula to solve for the Schwarzschild radius:
   Schwarzschild radius = (θ * d) / 2

3) Given values:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

4) Convert degrees to radians (1 degree = π/180 radians):
   θ = 10^-17 * (π/180) radians

5) 1 parsec = 3.086 × 10^16 meters
   So, distance = 10^10 * (3.086 × 10^16) = 3.086 ×...
