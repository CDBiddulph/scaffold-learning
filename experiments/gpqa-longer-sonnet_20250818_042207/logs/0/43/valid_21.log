S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one is the structure of product 4

2025-08-18 12:04:01,224 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction: TBS protection
• The hydroxyl group is protected by tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) chloride
• This forms a stable silyl ether

2) Second reaction: Organocopper addition
• Ph2CuLi is a soft nucleophile that adds to the α,β-unsaturated ketone
• This adds a phenyl group at the α-position
• Benzyl bromide then alkylates the copper intermediate
• This adds a benzyl group to the same carbon

3) Third reaction: Alkylation
• LDA deprotonates at the α-pos...
