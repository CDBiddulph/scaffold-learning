=== INPUT ===
9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride is the product
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:03:50,907 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, 9-fluorenone is the starting material, which has a ketone group and a fused ring system.

2) Two equivalents of selectfluor were used, suggesting a potential fluorination reaction.

3) The 19F NMR shows two fluorine signals:
   - One at +29.8 ppm
   - Another at -115.7 ppm

4) This suggests that two fluorine atoms have been added to the molecule.

5) Looking at the position of the fluorine atoms, they could be at the 1 and 5 positions of the fluorenone r...
