a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A) c a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth
B) a
C) b
D) d

1) First, let's understand what determines a planet's density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• For a spherical planet, volume depends on radius
• Same composition means similar material density

2) Let's analyze each option:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
• This would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

b) 2 Earth masses planet with 5.5 g/cm³ density:
• This would likely have a larger radius to accommodate more mass
• Probably not the highest...
