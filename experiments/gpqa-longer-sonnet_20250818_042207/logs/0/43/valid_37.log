=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137 is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) The two fundamental forces at play here seem to be:
   • Gravitational attraction (always attractive)
   • Electrostatic repulsion/attraction (can be attractive or repulsive)

2) The strength of these forces follow different distance-dependent formulas:
   • Gravitational force: F = G(m1*m2)/r²
   • Electrostatic force: F = k(q1*q2)/r²

3) Key observation: Both formulas have an r² dependence in the denominator

4) The "smallest attainable charge" suggests eleme...
