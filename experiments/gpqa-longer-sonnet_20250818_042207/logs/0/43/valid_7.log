=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle, since the C-NOT here flips the target when the control is \left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 12:03:42,069 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the CNOT gate's behavior:
   • It flips the target qubit ONLY if the control qubit is |1⟩
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged

2) In this input state, the first qubit (control qubit) is |0⟩
   • So the CNOT gate will NOT flip the target qubit
   • The state of the control qubit remains |0⟩

3) Let's examine the state components:
   • Control qubit: |0⟩
   • Target qubit: Initially |0⟩

4) The state before CNOT is:
