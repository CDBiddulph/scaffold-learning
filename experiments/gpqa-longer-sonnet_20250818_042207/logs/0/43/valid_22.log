=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in bromination of the given benzene derivatives
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:04:01,535 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by considering the directing effects of substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):
- Methyl group is a strong activating group
- Strongly directs substitution to ortho and para positions
- Para/ortho ratio is high (≈ 2:1)

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):
- Ester group is weakly deactivating
- Weakly directs to meta position
- Low para yield

3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):
- Chlorine is a deactivating group
- Slightly directs to para position
- Moderate para yield

4) C6H5...
