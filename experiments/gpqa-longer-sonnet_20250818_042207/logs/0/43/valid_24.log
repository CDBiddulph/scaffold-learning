=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, recall that particle number reaching the ground depends on time dilation and distance traveled.

2) Calculate distance traveled for each particle:
• Distance = Speed × Time
• Time = 1e-5s
• Distances:
- Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 28800m
- Eta (0.9c): 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 27000m
- Chi (0.88c): 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 26400m
- Lambda (0.93c): 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 27900m

3) Compare distances to atmospheric height (13000m):
• Zeta: 28800...
