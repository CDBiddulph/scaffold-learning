=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers in the PFA-only IKAROS ChIP-seq dataset

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Understand the scenario:
- ChIP-seq experiment with IKAROS antibody
- Different crosslinking conditions (PFA vs PFA+DSG)
- Peaks found in PFA-only condition disappear with PFA+DSG

2. Consider crosslinking properties:
- PFA creates reversible protein-protein and protein-DNA crosslinks
- DSG adds more rigid, less reversible crosslinks
- Changes in crosslinking can reveal different chromatin interaction properties

3. Analyze where such "disappearing peaks" are m...
