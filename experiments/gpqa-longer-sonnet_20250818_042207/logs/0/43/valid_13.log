1) First, let's understand what SMEFT is:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• It's a framework for parametrizing potential new physics beyond the Standard Model

2) Lorentz Symmetry:
• This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in relativistic theories
• SMEFT is built on relativistic quantum field theory principles
• THEREFORE, Lorentz symmetry is RESPECTED

3) Poincare Symmetry:
• This includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
• ...
