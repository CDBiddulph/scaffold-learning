Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:04:00,925 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. For a saturated hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must:
- Be a single molecule
- Have a carbon skeleton with no symmetry
- Contain at least one chiral center

2. Let's analyze each data set's molecular formula:

A) 72 รท 14 = 5.14 (not a whole number)
B) 86 รท 14 = 6.14 (not a whole number)
C) 58 รท 14 = 4.14 (not a whole number)
D) 100 รท 14 = 7.14 (not a whole number)

3. Let's try elemental analysis to determine molecular formula:

A) C5H12 (pentane) - symm...
