2025-08-18 12:04:19,569 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light color and energy:
• Higher energy = shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
• Lower energy = longer wavelength (red/orange end of spectrum)

2) The problem gives us the emitted light energy: 2.3393 eV

3) When a substance emits light, it typically means the substance has first absorbed light at a complementary color

4) The complementary color is on the opposite side of the color wheel from the emitted color...
