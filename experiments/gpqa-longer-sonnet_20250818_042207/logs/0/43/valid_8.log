What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration

1) First, let's write the dissociation equation for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5 × 10¹⁰

3) The concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

4) We can set up the equilibrium constant expression:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

5) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = Kf × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

6) Since the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻]

7) Substituting t...
