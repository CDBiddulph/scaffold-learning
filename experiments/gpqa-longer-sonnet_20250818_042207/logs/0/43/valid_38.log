1) First, let's understand what a Cope rearrangement is:
• It's a concerted thermal rearrangement of 1,5-dienes
• It involves a rearrangement of atoms through a cyclic transition state
• Happens at high temperatures
• Changes the connectivity of the molecule

2) Looking at the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene:
• It has a bicyclic structure
• Contains a vinyl group
• Has a nitrogen atom in the ring

3) In a Cope rearrangement, the vin...
