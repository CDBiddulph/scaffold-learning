=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one, the elimination product from 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol indicated by the 1690 cm^-1 IR band
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:04:10,031 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol
• This is a diol with two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbon atoms
• When treated with acid, this can undergo an elimination reaction

2. Consider the IR absorption at 1690 cm^-1
• This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch
• Indicates a ketone or aldehyde functional group

3. Analyze possible elimination products:
• Acid treatment of a vicinal diol often leads to ketone formation
• The mechanism involves l...
