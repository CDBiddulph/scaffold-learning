=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25Â°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V is the resulting redox potential of the solution
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 12:04:11,684 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Nernst equation for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system:
   E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

2) Initially, the concentrations of Fe(III) and Fe(II) are both 0.01 M.

3) However, when phosphate is added, Fe(III) will form a complex with H2PO4^- with a high formation constant of 10^21.

4) The formation of this complex will significantly reduce the free Fe(III) concentration.

5) The formation constant suggests that almost all Fe(III) will be co...
