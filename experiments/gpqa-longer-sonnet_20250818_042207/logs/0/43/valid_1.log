=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's recall the half-life of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years (≈ 15.7 million minutes)

2) Calculate the decay constant (λ):
• λ = ln(2) / half-life
• λ = 0.693 / (15.7 × 10^6) ≈ 4.4 × 10^-8 per minute

3) Calculate number of decays in 80 minutes:
• Number of atoms = 10^17
• Decay fraction = 1 - e^(-λt)
• Decay fraction = 1 - e^(-(4.4 × 10^-8) × 80)
• ≈ 1 - 0.9999645
• ≈ 3.55 × 10^-5 of total atoms

4) Calculate number of dec...
