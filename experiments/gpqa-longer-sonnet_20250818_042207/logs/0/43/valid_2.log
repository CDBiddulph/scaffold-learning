=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 % — two spots were seen on the TLC, and the isolated 4 g product corresponds to a 66.66% yield
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's calculate the theoretical yield:
• The students started with 10 g of benzoic acid
• Assuming this is a quantitative conversion, the product should weigh the same as the starting material

2) Check the actual yield:
• The students isolated 4 g of the product

3) Calculate percentage yield:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield ÷ Theoretical yield) × 100
• (4 g ÷ 10 g) × 100 = 40%

4) But the question states the percentage yield is 55.55%, 66.66%, or 77...
