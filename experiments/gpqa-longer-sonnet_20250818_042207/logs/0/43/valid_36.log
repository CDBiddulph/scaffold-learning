=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:04:11,621 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the key information:
• Satellites detected objects with localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Consider what localization precision means:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular range
• This suggests these are likely detecting objects at significant distances

3. Analyze the distance scales in the options:
• Option A: 1 million/1 billion light years ...
