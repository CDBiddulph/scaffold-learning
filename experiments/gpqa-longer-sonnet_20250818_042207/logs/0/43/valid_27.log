=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25 is the expectation value of S_y

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin in a given direction is calculated as:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) Given state ψ = (3i, 4)

3) σ_y matrix is given as:
   \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}

4) Let's calculate ψ† σ_y ψ:
   • First, ψ† = (3i*, 4*) = (-3i, 4)
   • Multiply σ_y ψ first:
     \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & -i \\
     i & 0
     \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = 
     \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3i \end{pmatr...
