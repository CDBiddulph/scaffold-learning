1) First, let's understand what happens when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI:
   • The reaction will reduce the molecule
   • Aldehydes (-CHO) will be converted to alkyl groups
   • Double bonds will be saturated with hydrogen
   • Carboxylic acid groups will likely remain unchanged

2) Let's look at the starting molecule:
   • It has an aldehyde group
   • Has a vinyl group
   • Has a double bond in the ring
