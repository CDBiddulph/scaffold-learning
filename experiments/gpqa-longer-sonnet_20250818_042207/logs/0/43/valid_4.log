=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:03:42,879 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

2) We've already observed this specific atom for 50 minutes, and it has not decayed.

3) This is a conditional probability problem. We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the first 50 minutes.

4) This suggests an exponential decay scenario, where the probability of decay is time-dependent.

5) Let's calculate the probability of survival ...
