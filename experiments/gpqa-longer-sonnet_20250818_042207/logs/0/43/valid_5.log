=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm is the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction
C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:
   Im(f(0)) = (2/k) ∑ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) sin(δ_l)
   Where k is the wave number.

2) The phase shifts given are for l = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

3) k can be calculated from the electron energy. 
   k = √(2mE) = √(2 * 50 MeV)
   But we don't actually need to calculate k fully as it's a constant.

4) Let's calculate the sin(δ_l) terms:
   sin(δ_0) = sin(90°) = 1
   sin(δ_1) = sin(67°) = 0.923...
