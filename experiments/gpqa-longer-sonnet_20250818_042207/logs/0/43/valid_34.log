=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315 for ACAGTGACC

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:04:11,727 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's look at the given examples:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. We need to find a consistent rule that could generate these outputs.

3. Let's look at the lengths:
   AGG is 3 characters long
   TGCTGA is 6 characters long
   ACAGTGACC is 9 characters long

4. A possible pattern is length-related:
   3 characters -> 115
   6 characters -> 176
   9 characters -> ?

5. Let's look at the numeric progression:
   3 chars -> 115
   6 chars -> 176
   Difference i...
