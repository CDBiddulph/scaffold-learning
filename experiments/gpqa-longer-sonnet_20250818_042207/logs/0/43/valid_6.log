trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D) 11 carbon atoms in product 3

1) First, let's understand trans-cinnamaldehyde:
• It has a molecular formula of C9H8O
• It contains a benzene ring, a 3-carbon side chain, and an aldehyde group

2) Trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide (Product 1):
• This is a Grignard reaction that adds a methyl group
• Product 1 will have C10H10O

3) Product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (Product 2):
• This oxidizes the alcohol to a ketone
• Molecular formula remains C10H10O
• Structure changes, but c...
