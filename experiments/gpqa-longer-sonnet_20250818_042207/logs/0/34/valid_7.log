=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle, since the C-NOT here flips the target when the control is \left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 11:56:30,933 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate's behavior:
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit is flipped
   • If the control qubit is |1⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit

2) In the given input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩:
   • The first part is the control qubit's state
   • The second part is the target qubit's state, which is |0⟩

3) The condition here is that the first (control) qubit must be |0⟩

4) Since the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit will be flipped

5) Flipping |0⟩ gives |1⟩, and flipping |1⟩ gives |0⟩

6) Therefore, the output will be:
   (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |1⟩

7) This matches exactly with option B.

Therefore, let's verify the reasoning carefully.
