2025-08-18 11:56:40,827 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's identify the key parameters:
   - 13 particles with charge 2e
   - 12 particles are at a fixed distance of 2 m from point P
   - 13th particle is at point P
   - We need to find the minimum electrostatic energy

2) Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

4) Potential energy between two point charges is given by:
   U = k(q1 × q2)/r

5) Interactions to consider:
   - 12 particles interact with the particle at P
   - 12 particles interact with each other

6) Energy between particle at P and 12 other particles:
   U1 = k(3.2 × 10^-19)² × 12 / 2
   = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² × 12 / 2
   = 5.645 × 10^-26 J

7) Checking the options, this matches option C.
