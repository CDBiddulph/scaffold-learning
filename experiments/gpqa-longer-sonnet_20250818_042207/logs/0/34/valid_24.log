=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:56:50,161 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate how far each particle travels in 1e-5s:
   - Zeta (0.96c): Distance = 0.96 * c * 1e-5s = 0.96 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 2,880 meters
   - Eta (0.9c): Distance = 0.9 * c * 1e-5s = 0.9 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 2,700 meters
   - Chi (0.88c): Distance = 0.88 * c * 1e-5s = 0.88 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 2,640 meters
   - Lambda (0.93c): Distance = 0.93 * c * 1e-5s = 0.93 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 2,790 meters

2) Compare these distances with the initial height (13,000m):
   - Zeta: 2,880m traveled, 10,120m remaining
   - Eta: 2,700m traveled, 10,300m remaining
   - Chi: 2,640m traveled, 10,360m remaining
   - Lambda: 2,790m traveled, 10,210m remaining

3) None reach the ground in 1e-5s

4) Ordering by distance traveled:
   Zeta (2,880m) > Lambda (2,790m) > Eta (2,700m) > Chi (2,640m)

5) This corresponds to option B.
