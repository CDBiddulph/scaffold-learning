2025-08-18 11:56:31,568 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding Density
- Density = Mass ÷ Volume
- For a planet with the same composition, the density will remain constant
- If mass increases proportionally with volume, density stays the same

2. Analyzing Option A (5x Earth's mass)
- Same composition as Earth
- Mass increased 5 times
- Volume will increase proportionally (radius increases)
- Density remains constant at ~5.5 g/cm³

3. Analyzing Option B (Earth-mass and Earth-radius)
- This will have exactly Earth's density (~5.5 g/cm³)
- No change in density from Earth's standard

4. Analyzing Option C (2 Earth masses, 5.5 g/cm³)
- This has a specified density
- Definite calculation of density given

5. Analyzing Option D (Half Earth's mass)
- Same composition as Earth
- Mass halved
- Volume will decrease proportionally
- Density remains constant at ~5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparing Options
- Options A, B, and D maintain the same density
- Option C has a defined density value of 5.5 g/cm³

Therefore, Option C will have the highest density.
