2025-08-18 11:56:51,589 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the area of the event horizon, and l_p is the Planck length

2) To find the area, we first need the actual radius of the event horizon

3) Angular size θ relates to actual size by the formula: θ = size/distance
   10^-17 degrees = size / (10^10 parsecs)

4) 1 degree = π/180 radians
   10^-17 degrees = (10^-17 * π/180) radians

5) Size = distance * angular size
   Size ≈ (10^10 parsecs) * (10^-17 * π/180)
   ≈ 10^-7 parsecs

6) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   10^-7 parsecs ≈ 3 * 10^9 meters

7) Event horizon radius r = 3 * 10^9 meters
   Area = 4πr² ≈ 10^20 m²

8) Entropy S = (Boltzmann constant * Area) / (Planck length squared)
   ≈ 10^-23 * 10^20 / (10^-35)²
   ≈ 10^62 J/K

9) This matches option C.
