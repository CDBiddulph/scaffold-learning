=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH in single cells
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

2025-08-18 11:56:59,835 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C data characteristics:
- Based on 50M cells
- Significant interaction signal between promoter and enhancer
- Linear genomic distance of ~1 Mb
- High confidence statistical signal

2. FISH validation:
- Could not validate the Hi-C interaction
- Suggests potential discrepancy in interaction detection

3. Additional experimental evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting of enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This suggests a real functional interaction exists

4. Analyzing possible reasons for Hi-C vs FISH discrepancy:
- Option A: Low interaction frequency in single cells is most plausible
- Option B: Structural variation could potentially explain differences
- Option C: Linear distance seems reasonable for FISH detection
- Option D: A complete false-positive seems unlikely given functional validation

5. Key insights:
- Hi-C measures population-averaged interactions
- FISH visualizes interactions in individual cells
- Low frequency interactions might be statistically significant in population but hard to detect individually
- Functional reduction of expression supports a real interaction

6. Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH in single cells.
