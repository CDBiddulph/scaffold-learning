2025-08-18 11:57:07,833 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the relationship between energy and color in the visible spectrum:
• Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
• Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel

2. The given energy is 2.3393 eV

3. Convert this energy to wavelength:
• Using E = hc/λ
• h (Planck's constant) = 4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s
• c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
• λ = (hc)/E
• λ ≈ 530 nm

4. Wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to green-yellow region of the spectrum

5. Complementary color to green-yellow is violet-blue

6. The complementary color is the color absorbed by the compound

7. Since the wavelength is closer to yellow, the absorbed color would be violet-blue

8. Looking at the options, violet matches this reasoning

Therefore, the color absorbed would be violet.
