=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:56:31,226 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand radioactive decay:
• Caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years
• Each radioactive atom emits a gamma-ray when it decays

2. Calculate decay rate:
• Total atoms = 10^17
• In 80 minutes, a fraction of these atoms will decay
• Decay constant depends on half-life

3. Calculate gamma-ray emission:
• Approximately one gamma-ray is emitted per radioactive decay
• So number of gamma-rays ≈ number of decayed atoms

4. Consider detector geometry:
• Detector size: 2 x 3 cm = 6 cm²
• Distance: 4 meters
• Solid angle will affect detection probability

5. Rough estimation:
• With 10^17 atoms, decay rate would be significant
• Over 80 minutes, likely to detect around 10^6 gamma-rays
• Detector efficiency and geometry might reduce this somewhat

6. Checking the options:
• Option C: 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays matches our estimation
