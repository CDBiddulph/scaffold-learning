=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16

2025-08-18 11:57:09,262 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   Energy ∝ 1/wavelength ∝ Temperature

2) Peak photon energies:
   • Star A: 7.21 eV
   • Sun: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio calculation:
   T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

4) The Stefan-Boltzmann law relates luminosity to radius and temperature:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴

5) We know Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

6) Let's set up the luminosity equation:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴

7) Solve for R/R_sun:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴
   24 = (R/R_sun)² × 135.4
   (R/R_sun)² = 24/135.4
   R/R_sun = √(24/135.4)
   R/R_sun = 0.42 × 0.42 = 0.17

8) This corresponds to option D.
