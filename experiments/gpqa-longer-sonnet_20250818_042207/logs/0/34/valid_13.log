2025-08-18 11:56:40,303 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT means:
• SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• It's an extension of the Standard Model that incorporates possible new physics at high energy scales

2. Let's examine each symmetry and its implications:

• Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental to all relativistic quantum field theories
- Describes how physics looks the same in different inertial reference frames
- MUST be respected by all SMEFT operators

• Poincare Symmetry:
- Includes Lorentz transformations plus spacetime translations
- Also fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
- MUST be respected by all SMEFT operators

• CP Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
- Not necessarily preserved in all SMEFT operators
- Some SMEFT operators can violate CP symmetry

• CPT Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal
- A fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories
- Generally preserved in SMEFT

3. Analyzing the requirements:
- Lorentz symmetry ✓
- Poincare symmetry ✓
- CP symmetry ✗
- CPT symmetry ✓

4. This matches option A: 1, 2, 4 are respected by all SMEFT operators.
