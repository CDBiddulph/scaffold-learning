2025-08-18 11:56:30,873 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) We start with the dissociation equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4-

2) The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as KCa-EDTA = 5 × 10^10

3) We know the initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of free Ca2+ ions that dissociate

5) We can set up the equilibrium expression:
   Kf = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA]
   5 × 10^10 = x2 / (0.02 - x)

6) Given the very large equilibrium constant, we can assume x is very small compared to 0.02

7) Simplifying the equation:
   5 × 10^10 = x2 / 0.02

8) Solving for x:
   x = √(5 × 10^10 × 0.02)
   x = √(1 × 10^9)
   x = 6.3 × 10^-7 M

9) This represents the free Ca2+ concentration

Looking at the options, this matches option B.
