=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:57:00,128 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key information:
• Satellites detect astronomical objects
• Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
• Distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Localization precision gives us a hint about the detection range:
• 100-200 arc minutes suggests a relatively low-precision measurement
• This implies the objects are likely to be quite far away

3. Let's analyze the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years - extremely large, beyond our galaxy
B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years - within our galaxy
C) 10 or 100 light years - very close, within our solar neighborhood
D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds - extremely close (within solar system)

4. Considerations:
• With an isotropic distribution and low precision (100-200 arc minutes)
• We need a scale where objects are numerous and distributed uniformly
• This points to galactic or intergalactic scales

5. Conclusion:
Option B (1 thousand or 100 thousand light years) best matches the description. This range covers most of our Milky Way galaxy, where astronomical objects would be numerous and uniformly distributed.
