=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development, causing mosaicism

2025-08-18 11:56:41,406 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The key observation is that cells from different lineages have differing genomes, which suggests mosaicism in the transgenic animal.

2. Mosaicism means that not all cells in the organism have the same genetic makeup, which can occur during early embryonic development.

3. Let's analyze each option:

A) Converting messenger RNA to cDNA and genome incorporation is not a typical mechanism and unlikely to cause mosaicism.

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation is also not a standard mechanism for genome editing.

C) Accidentally incorporating surrogate mother's DNA is highly improbable and not related to genome editing.

D) This option suggests that the Cas9 protein continued to cut DNA and incorporate donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

4. In CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, if the editing occurs at different stages of early embryonic cell division, some cells will have the edit while others will not, leading to mosaicism.

5. This means that the Cas9 protein might continue to be active and make edits as the embryo develops, causing different cells to have different genetic modifications.

6. This mechanism perfectly explains the observation of different genomes in different cell lineages.

Therefore, the most probable cause of the observed differing genomes is option D.
