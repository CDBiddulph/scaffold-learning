Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:56:49,980 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically active compounds require:
- A molecule with a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- At least one carbon with 4 different substituents

2. Saturated hydrocarbon requirements:
- Only single bonds
- Only carbon and hydrogen atoms
- Formula will be CnH2n+2

3. Let's check the mass spectrometry (EI-MS) data to confirm the molecular weight:
A) Molecular weight around 72
B) Molecular weight around 86
C) Molecular weight around 58
D) Molecular weight around 100

4. For an optically active saturated hydrocarbon, we need a molecular formula where a chiral center is possible.

5. Looking at molecular weight:
- 72 (A) suggests C5H12
- 86 (B) suggests C6H14
- 58 (C) suggests C4H10
- 100 (D) suggests C7H16

6. C7H16 (option D) can have multiple chiral centers, making it optically active.

7. Specifically, 2-methylhexane would be an optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
