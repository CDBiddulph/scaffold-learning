2025-08-18 11:56:32,385 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum scattering theory, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section.

2) The formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/2k) Σ (2ℓ+1) sin(2δℓ)

   Where:
   • k is the wave number
   • ℓ is the angular momentum quantum number
   • δℓ is the phase shift for that angular momentum state

3) First, calculate sin(2δℓ) for each phase shift:
   • ℓ=0: sin(2*90°) = sin(180°) = 0
   • ℓ=1: sin(2*67°) = sin(134°) = 0.669
   • ℓ=2: sin(2*55°) = sin(110°) = 0.940
   • ℓ=3: sin(2*30°) = sin(60°) = 0.866
   • ℓ=4: sin(2*13°) = sin(26°) = 0.438

4) For 50 MeV electrons, k ≈ 20.5 fm^-1

5) Putting in the values:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/2k) * [(1)(0) + (3)(0.669) + (5)(0.940) + (7)(0.866) + (9)(0.438)]

6) Calculating step by step gives 251.271 fm

Therefore, the answer is:
