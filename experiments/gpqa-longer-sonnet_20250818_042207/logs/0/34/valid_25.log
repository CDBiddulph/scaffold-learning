=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:56:49,872 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, the constraints on the wave function:
   - Time independent
   - Spherically symmetric
   - Imaginary part is zero

2) We're told that the probability of finding the particle in two different shells is equal (P):
   - First shell: from d1 to 2d1
   - Second shell: from 2d1 to 3d1

3) The probability of finding a particle in a spherical shell depends on:
   - The volume of the shell
   - The probability density (wave function squared)

4) Volume of a spherical shell depends on r²
   - Shell volume ∝ (outer radius)³ - (inner radius)³

5) First shell volume (d1 to 2d1):
   V1 = (2d1)³ - (d1)³

6) Second shell volume (2d1 to 3d1):
   V2 = (3d1)³ - (2d1)³

7) If these volumes have equal probability, the wave function must compensate for volume differences.

8) The wave function must have a form that makes probability constant across shells.

9) Probability density = (wave function)² × Volume

10) This suggests the wave function should be proportional to 1/r
