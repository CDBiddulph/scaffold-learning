2025-08-18 11:56:49,979 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
   Apparent Magnitude = Absolute Magnitude + 5 log10(distance/10 parsecs)

2) For option A:
   • Given apparent magnitude is 7 mag at 20 parsecs
   • Apparent magnitude remains 7 mag

3) For option B:
   • Absolute magnitudes of 7 and 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   • To find apparent magnitude, we need to combine their brightnesses
   • Total brightness = 10^(-0.4 * 7) + 10^(-0.4 * 7)
   • This will result in an apparent magnitude brighter than 7 mag

4) For option C:
   • Apparent magnitudes of 7 and 8 mag at 5 parsecs
   • Total brightness will be larger than B
   • Combined apparent magnitude will be brighter

5) For option D:
   • Absolute magnitude of 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   • By definition, this means apparent magnitude will be 7 mag

6) Comparing the candidates, the two-star system at 5 parsecs (option C) will appear brightest.

The combined brightness of a two-star system depends on their individual magnitudes and can be calculated, but C represents the brightest system.
