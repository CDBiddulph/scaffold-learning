=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet for the most deshielded hydrogen in 2
D) doublet

2025-08-18 11:57:09,076 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
• This is a bicyclic ketone structure

2. UV irradiation produces product 1
• Since molecular weight remains the same, this suggests a photochemical rearrangement
• Likely a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition, creating a cyclobutanone structure

3. Hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2 produces product 2
• This will reduce the ketone to an alcohol
• The cyclobutanone ring will remain intact

4. Analyzing the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2
• In a cyclobutane ring with an alcohol group, the hydrogen adjacent to the alcohol group will likely experience the most complex coupling
• This hydrogen will have different coupling constants with neighboring hydrogens
• This would create a doublet of doublets splitting pattern

5. The doublet of doublets arises from coupling with two non-equivalent neighboring hydrogens with different coupling constants

Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus will show a doublet of doublets in the 1H NMR spectrum.
