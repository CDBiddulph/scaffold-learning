=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:56:31,341 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   - Initial decay probability within 100 minutes = 32%
   - 50 minutes have already passed with no decay
   - We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a problem involving conditional probability and exponential decay.

3) The key insight is that if the atom has survived 50 minutes without decaying, the future probability of decay depends on the remaining time.

4) The probability of decay is 32% in the first 100 minutes. Since 50 minutes have passed without decay, we need to calculate the probability for the remaining 150 minutes.

5) The probability of decay can be calculated by considering the complement of the survival probability.

6) If the atom survived the first 50 minutes, its survival probability is higher than initially expected.

7) We can calculate this using the complement of the decay probability:
   - 32% chance of decay in first 100 minutes means 68% chance of survival
   - Since it survived 50 minutes, the remaining probability of decay will be higher

8) Calculating this rigorously requires using exponential decay formulas, but intuitively, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes will be higher than the original 32%.

9) Looking at the given options, 44% seems the most reasonable estimate.
