All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA — this statement is incorrect
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 11:56:41,155 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

A) Frameshifting statement:
- The statement seems technically sound
- Mentions that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 show similar pseudoknot conformations
- This description aligns with current molecular biology understanding
- Appears to be CORRECT

B) nsp10/nsp14-ExoN statement:
- This statement suggests nsp14's ExoN domain binds to nsp10 to prevent dsRNA breakdown
- However, this seems INCORRECT
- In reality, nsp10/nsp14-ExoN is a proofreading mechanism that actually helps PREVENT RNA degradation
- The statement's logic implies preventing breakdown, which contradicts its own wording
- This looks like the INCORRECT statement we're seeking

C) ORF3a apoptosis statement:
- Describes ORF3a triggering caspase-8 activation
- Explains mechanism via extrinsic apoptotic pathway
- Consistent with current research on viral protein interactions
- Appears CORRECT

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting statement:
- Describes the mechanism of creating polyproteins
- Suggests similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting
- Technically accurate
- Appears CORRECT

After careful analysis, the statement in option B appears to be incorrect.
