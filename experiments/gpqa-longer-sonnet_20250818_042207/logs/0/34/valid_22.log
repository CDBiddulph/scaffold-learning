=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in bromination of the given benzene derivatives
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:56:49,630 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) The orientation of substitution depends on the electronic effects of the substituent groups already present on the benzene ring.

2) Substituents are classified as:
- Activating ortho/para directors
- Deactivating meta directors

3) Let's analyze each substituent:
- C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Activating ortho/para director
- C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Deactivating meta director
- C6H5-Cl (chloro): Deactivating meta director
- C6H5-NO2 (nitro): Strong deactivating meta director
- C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl): Activating ortho/para director
- C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating meta director

4) Para isomer yield increases with:
- Activating ortho/para directors
- Less deactivating groups

5) Based on this analysis, the order from lowest to highest para isomer yield would be:
NO2 < COOH < Ester < Cl < Methyl < Ethyl

6) This matches option B: 4<6<2<1<5<3
