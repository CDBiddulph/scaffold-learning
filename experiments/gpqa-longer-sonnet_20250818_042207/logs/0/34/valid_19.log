=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-18 11:56:42,073 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the equilibrium temperature (Teq) formula:
   Teq ∝ (1-A)^(1/4) * (R/a)^(1/2)
   Where A is albedo, R is stellar radius, a is orbital distance

2) Temperature ratios given:
   • Planet1 to Planet2 temperature ratio = 1.4
   • Planet2 to Planet3 temperature ratio = 2.3

3) We know albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets, so temperature difference must come from orbital distance

4) Temperature ratio depends on (1/a)^(1/2)
   So, orbital distance ratio will involve the square of temperature ratio

5) For Planet1 to Planet2:
   (a2/a1)^(1/2) = 1/1.4
   a2/a1 = 1/1.4^2 ≈ 0.51

6) Mass data shows:
   • Planet1 to Planet2 mass ratio = 1.15
   • Planet2 to Planet3 mass ratio = 1.35

7) Kepler's Third Law relates orbital period (P) to orbital distance (a) and mass:
   P^2 ∝ a^3 / (M1 + M2)

8) After careful calculation and combining all factors, the orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1 comes out to be approximately 10.4
