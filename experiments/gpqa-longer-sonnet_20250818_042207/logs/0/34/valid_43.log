=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG are the forward and reverse primers
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:57:09,434 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the requirements:
- We need to clone the sequence into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the expression vector
- We want directional cloning
- We have several restriction enzyme options

2. Examine the MCS of the vector:
- Contains HindIII and KpnI sites
- This suggests we should use these for cloning

3. Analyze the primer requirements:
- Forward primer should have a HindIII site
- Reverse primer should have a KpnI site
- Primers must flank the entire coding sequence

4. Check the sequence:
- First codon (ATG) needs to be preserved
- Last few codons should be included

5. Evaluate the primer options:
- Option A has HindIII on forward and KpnI on reverse ✓
- Preserves the start codon ✓
- Allows directional cloning ✓

6. Quick verification of Option A:
- Forward primer: aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG
  - Adds HindIII site
  - Starts with ATG start codon
- Reverse primer: aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
  - Adds KpnI site
  - Includes complete end of sequence
