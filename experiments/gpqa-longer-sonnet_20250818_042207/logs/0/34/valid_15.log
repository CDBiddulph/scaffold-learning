=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:56:40,529 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram determines its complexity and order of perturbation calculation.

2. The number of loops relates directly to the power of the coupling constant (α or g) and the complexity of the integral.

3. Let's analyze the given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

4. The power of the coupling constants can give us a hint about the number of loops:
   - α^3 suggests multiple interaction vertices
   - g^2 suggests multiple interactions as well

5. The factor 1/(4pi)^6 is significant - this typically indicates a multi-loop integral, with the power of 1/(4pi) correlating with the number of loops.

6. The (4pi)^6 suggests 3 loops, as 1/(4pi)^6 would arise from a 3-loop diagram's phase space integration.

7. The additional sqrt(2) * 8 factor doesn't change the loop count.

8. Therefore, this expression most likely corresponds to a 3-loop Feynman diagram.
