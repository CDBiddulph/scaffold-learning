=== INPUT ===
Which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT?

1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

A) 1,2,4 are respected by all operators in the SMEFT
B) 1,3,4
C) 1,2
D) 3,4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:12,244 [INFO] LLM response: Let me break this down carefully:

SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) must respect:
1. Lorentz symmetry ✓ (fundamental to field theory)
2. Poincaré symmetry ✓ (includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations)
3. CP symmetry ❌ (can be violated in some operators)
4. CPT symmetry ✓ (fundamental quantum field theory requirement)

Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1, 2, and 4.

This corresponds to option A: 1, 2, 4 are respected by all operators in the SMEFT.
