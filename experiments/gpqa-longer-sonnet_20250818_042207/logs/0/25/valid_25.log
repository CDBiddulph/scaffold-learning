=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:49:18,667 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The question is asking about the wave function's form that makes the probability equal in two adjacent shells.

2) Recall that probability = |Ψ(r)|^2

3) The two shells are:
   • First shell: between d1 and 2d1
   • Second shell: between 2d1 and 3d1

4) These shells have different volumes. A shell's volume depends on r^2.

5) For the probabilities to be equal in these shells with different volumes, the wave function must compensate for the volume difference.

6) If the wave function is proportional to 1/r, then:
   Probability ∝ (1/r)^2 * r^2 = constant

7) This means |Ψ(r)| = 1/r will yield equal probabilities in the two shells.

8) Therefore, the wave function must have the form 1/r.

The answer is A.
