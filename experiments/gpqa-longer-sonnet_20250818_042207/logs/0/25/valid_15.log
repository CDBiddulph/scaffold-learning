=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:13,251 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze the given expression to estimate the number of loops:

The key factor in determining loop count is typically the power of the coupling constant (typically represented by α or g) and the number of loop-related factors like 1/(4π)^n.

In this case:
- α^3 suggests multiple loop corrections
- g^2 also indicates loop contributions
- 1/(4π)^6 implies a high-order loop correction

By convention, the power of (1/4π)^n typically corresponds to the number of loops.

Here, (1/4π)^6 suggests 6 loops.

Therefore, the answer is:

A
