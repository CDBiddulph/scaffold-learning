=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:06,905 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10

2) The stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

3) For the equilibrium: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

4) K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

5) Rearranging: [Ca²⁺] = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / (K[EDTA⁴⁻])

6) If we assume complete dissociation and the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M:
   [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 / (5x10^10)

7) Calculating: [Ca²⁺] = 4x10^-12 / 5x10^10 = 6.3x10^-7 M

8) This matches option B.
