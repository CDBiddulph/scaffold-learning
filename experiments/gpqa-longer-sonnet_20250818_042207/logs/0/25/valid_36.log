=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:23,932 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The question mentions low Earth orbit satellites detecting astronomical objects.

2. The localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes, which suggests the objects are very distant.

3. We want to check which set of distances seems plausible for astronomical objects.

A) 1 million or 1 billion light years - These are typical galactic and intergalactic distances. ✓
B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years - These are distances within our galaxy. ✓
C) 10 or 100 light years - These are very close distances (within our solar neighborhood). ✗
D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds - These are extremely short distances, much closer than planetary scales. ✗

The distances in option A and B are reasonable for astronomical objects. However, the question specifies "isotropic distribution", which is more consistent with very large-scale distances.

Therefore, the answer is A.
