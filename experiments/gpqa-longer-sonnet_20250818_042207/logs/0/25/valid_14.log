=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:15,149 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need the electrostatic potential energy between charges.
   The formula is U = kq1q2/r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²)

2) Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19 C)

3) Number of interactions:
   • 13th charge interacts with 12 other charges at distance 2 m
   • Interaction between 12 charges = (12 × 11)/2 = 66 interactions

4) Charge interaction energy:
   • k = 8.99 × 10^9
   • q1 = q2 = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19)
   • r = 2 m
   • U for one pair = (8.99 × 10^9) × (2 × 1.6 × 10^-19)² / 2
   • U total = 66 × this value
   • Calculated value ≈ 2.822 × 10^-26 J

5) This matches option D.
