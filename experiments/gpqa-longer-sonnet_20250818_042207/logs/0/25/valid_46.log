=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

1) First, recall the Wien displacement law relates peak wavelength/energy to temperature.

2) Temperature is proportional to peak photon energy.
   Star A peak: 7.21 eV
   Sun peak: 1.41 eV
   Temperature ratio = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

3) Luminosity is proportional to radius² × temperature⁴
   Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

4) Let R be the radius of star A relative to the sun's radius
   24 = R² × (5.11)⁴

5) Solve for R:
   R² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   R = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   R = √(24) / (5.11)²
   R ≈ 0.19

6) This corresponds to option B: 0.19 times the sun's radius

The answer is B.
