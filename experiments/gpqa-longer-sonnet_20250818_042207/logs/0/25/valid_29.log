=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:49:22,117 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a saturated hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must have:
- A single chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- An odd number of carbon atoms (to create asymmetry)

2) Let's analyze the molecular formulas using the percentage composition:

A) Molecular formula appears to be C5H12
B) Molecular formula appears to be C6H14
C) Molecular formula appears to be C4H8
D) Molecular formula appears to be C7H16

3) Looking for a molecule with a single chiral center:
- C5H12 (option A) can have 2-methylbutane, which has a chiral center
- C6H14 (option B) can have 2-methylpentane or 3-methylpentane, which have chiral centers
- C4H8 (option C) cannot have a chiral center
- C7H16 (option D) can have 2-methylhexane or 3-methylhexane, which have chiral centers

4) Checking the given data, option A matches these criteria.

Therefore, the answer is A.
