=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne as product C
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:14,572 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the molecular formulas:
   A: C6H13Br (1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane)
   B: C4H6 (but-1-yne)
   C: C10H18

2) The NMR signals for A, B, and C suggest a structural change with multiple carbon environments.

3) The reaction requires a nucleophilic substitution between an alkyl halide (A) and an alkyne (B).

4) The product C has a molecular formula of C10H18.

5) When 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane reacts with but-1-yne via nucleophilic substitution, the result is 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.

6) The molecular formula and NMR signals match the description in option B.

7) The reaction proceeds by replacing the bromine with the acetylide ion from but-1-yne.

Therefore, the answer is:

B
