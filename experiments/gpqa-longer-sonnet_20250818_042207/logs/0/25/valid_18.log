=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:13,899 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze the characteristics of the Mott-Gurney equation:

1) The equation describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
2) It assumes a single-carrier device
3) It requires:
   - No traps
   - No carrier injection barrier
   - Ohmic contacts
   - Negligible diffusion current

Checking the options:
A) Matches most of the requirements: trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current ✓
B) Very similar to A, but specifies "no carrier injection barrier" ✓
C) Incorrect due to Schottky contact
D) Incorrect because it's for a two-carrier device

Both A and B are very close, but option B is more precise in describing the conditions.

The answer is:

B
