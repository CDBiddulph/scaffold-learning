=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:06,554 [INFO] LLM response: Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the decay constant for Caesium-137 is about 0.693/30 years.

2) In 80 minutes (about 0.152 years), the decay fraction will be small.

3) The total number of decays depends on:
   • Total number of atoms (10^17)
   • Decay constant
   • Time period
   • Detector solid angle

4) A 2x3 cm detector at 4 meters will capture a small fraction of emitted gamma rays.

5) Typical detection efficiency for gamma rays might be around 10^-4 to 10^-3.

6) Rough calculation suggests around 10^6 gamma rays would be detected.

7) This corresponds precisely to option C: 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is:

C
