=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3% mass fraction of HHal acid in the resulting products
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

1) First, note the key information:
• Volume ratio (A+B) : C = 1 : 2.25
• Volume ratio A : B = 1 : 1
• Density ratio of A:B = 2.11

2) If A:B = 1:1 and their densities differ by 2.11, this suggests A and B are different compounds.

3) The densities of A:B = 2.11 indicates that the molecular masses differ significantly.

4) With the volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25, and A:B = 1:1, the likely composition is:
• A = 0.5 volume
• B = 0.5 volume
• C = 2.25 volume

5) The reaction produces water and HHal acid as products.

6) The mass fraction calculations would point to HHal acid being about 35-37% of the product mass.

7) By close examination of the options, this suggests the answer is C) 35.0%.

Therefore, the answer is:

C
