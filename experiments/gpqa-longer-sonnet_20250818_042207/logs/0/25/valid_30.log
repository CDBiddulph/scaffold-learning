=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one, the elimination product from 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol indicated by the 1690 cm^-1 IR band
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:21,490 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The starting material is 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol, which has two hydroxyl groups.

2) When treated with acid, this will undergo elimination to form a new product.

3) The IR absorption at 1690 cm^-1 is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch.

4) This suggests the product involves a ketone.

5) Specifically, this would be 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one, which forms when the diol eliminates water.

6) Let's check each option:
   A) Different structure
   B) Has an alcohol and alkene
   C) Matches the description perfectly - the elimination product with a C=O group at 1690 cm^-1
   D) A conjugated diene, not matching the IR evidence

7) The answer is C.
