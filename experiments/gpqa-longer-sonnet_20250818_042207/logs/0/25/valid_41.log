2025-08-18 11:49:28,540 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV.

2) The color of light absorbed will be the complementary color to the emitted light.

3) Using the visible light spectrum and complementary colors:
   • Blue light (wavelength around 470 nm) is complementary to orange
   • Violet light (wavelength around 420 nm) is complementary to yellow
   • Red light (wavelength around 650 nm) is complementary to green
   • Yellow light is complementary to blue/violet

4) Since the emitted light has an energy of 2.3393 eV, this suggests absorption of light in the blue-violet region.

5) The complementary color to blue/violet is yellow.

6) Therefore, yellow light is absorbed by the organic compound.

The answer is D.
