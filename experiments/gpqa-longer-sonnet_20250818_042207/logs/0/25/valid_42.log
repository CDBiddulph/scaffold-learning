=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up because the reaction is equilibrium-limited under the conditions used
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:29,811 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. The key challenge is to increase reactant conversion without compromising selectivity.
2. The student has already tried using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition without success.
3. The reaction is currently at 300°C.
4. The professor will likely recommend a thermodynamic strategy.

Crucially, in equilibrium-limited reactions, decreasing temperature can shift the equilibrium towards product formation, which can improve conversion.

Option A suggests giving up, which is incorrect.

Option B suggests decreasing temperature and increasing catalyst amount, which is a sound strategy to improve conversion.

Option C is similar to B, but adds a warning about potential polymerization, which shows additional technical insight.

Option D suggests the opposite (increasing temperature and decreasing catalyst), which would likely reduce conversion.

Between B and C, C is more technically comprehensive because it acknowledges the potential side reaction (polymerization) while proposing a thermodynamic approach.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

C
