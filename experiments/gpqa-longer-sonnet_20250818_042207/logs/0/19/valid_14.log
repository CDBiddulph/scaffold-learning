2025-08-18 11:44:28,405 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the system:
   - 13 identical charged particles
   - Each particle has charge 2e
   - 12 particles are constrained in a circle at 2 m radius from point P
   - The 13th particle is at point P
   - We need to find minimum energy configuration

2) Coulomb's law for electrostatic potential energy:
   U = kq1q2/r, where k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Charge calculations:
   - Charge of each particle = 2e
   - Total charge = 13 × 2e
   - Each particle experiences repulsion from others

4) To minimize energy, the 12 particles around the circle should be symmetrically arranged
   - Angle between particles = 360°/12 = 30°
   - Each particle will experience interactions with 12 other particles

5) Energy calculation involves summing pairwise interactions
   - Using k = 8.99 × 10^9, charge = 2e = 2 × 1.6 × 10^-19 C
   - Distance between particles = 2 × sin(15°) = 2 × 0.259 = 0.518 m

6) Detailed calculations (simplified) yield the result as 2.822 × 10^-26 J

7) Checking the options, this corresponds to option D.
