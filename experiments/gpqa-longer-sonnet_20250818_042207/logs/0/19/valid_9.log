2025-08-18 11:44:17,347 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the starting molecule:
• 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
• Contains a cyclohexene ring
• Has a formyl group (-CHO)
• Has a vinyl group (CH=CH2)
• Contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

2. The reaction conditions are:
• Red phosphorus
• Excess HI
• This suggests a reduction reaction

3. When reacted with HI and red phosphorus, the molecule will undergo:
• Reduction of the carboxylic acid group to an alkyl group
• Reduction of the formyl group to an alkyl group
• Reduction of the double bonds in the ring and vinyl group

4. After complete reduction, the molecule will become a fully saturated alkane with no rings

5. To calculate index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD):
• IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of double/triple bonds)
• In the fully reduced product, there are no rings or multiple bonds

6. Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency will be 0

Therefore, the answer is 0.
