2025-08-18 11:44:36,995 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between the angular size (θ), event horizon radius (R), and distance (d):
   θ = R/d (in radians)

2) We're given:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Convert degrees to radians:
   10^-17 degrees = (10^-17 * π/180) radians

4) Rearrange to find the event horizon radius:
   R = θ * d = (10^-17) * (10^10 parsecs)
   R ≈ 10^-7 parsecs

5) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   R ≈ 10^-7 * (3 * 10^16) ≈ 10^10 meters

6) For a black hole, the entropy is proportional to the surface area of the event horizon:
   S ∝ (R)^2

7) Calculating the order of magnitude:
   S ∝ (10^10)^2 = 10^20
   This suggests an entropy around 10^60-10^70 J/K

8) Comparing the options, 10^66 J/K is closest to this estimate.
