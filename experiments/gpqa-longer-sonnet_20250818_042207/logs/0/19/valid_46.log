2025-08-18 11:44:55,790 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
• T ∝ (Peak Energy)
• Star A peak: 7.21 eV
• Sun peak: 1.41 eV
• Temperature ratio = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

2) The Stefan-Boltzmann law relates luminosity to temperature and radius:
• L ∝ R² × T⁴
• Given luminosity is 24 times solar
• 24 = (R/R_sun)² × (T/T_sun)⁴

3) Substituting temperature ratio:
• 24 = (R/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴
• 24 = (R/R_sun)² × 541.34

4) Solving for R/R_sun:
• (R/R_sun)² = 24/541.34
• R/R_sun = √(24/541.34)
• R/R_sun ≈ 0.177 to 0.18

5) Looking at the options, 0.17 is closest to our calculated value.
