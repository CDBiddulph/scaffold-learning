=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle, since the C-NOT here flips the target when the control is \left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 11:44:16,642 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the input state:
   \left|\psi\right\rangle = \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left|0\right\rangle

2) The C-NOT gate's behavior depends on the control qubit:
   - If control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle, it does NOT flip the target qubit
   - If control qubit is \left|1\right\rangle, it flips the target qubit

3) In this case, the control qubit is already in the state \left|0\right\rangle

4) When the control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle, the target qubit remains unchanged

5) So the output state will be the same as the input state:
   U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle = \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left|0\right\rangle

6) This matches exactly with option A

Therefore, the output remains the same as the input because the control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle.
