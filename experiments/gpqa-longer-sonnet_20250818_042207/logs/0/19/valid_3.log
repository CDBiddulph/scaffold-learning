2025-08-18 11:44:17,424 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall that density is calculated as mass divided by volume.

2. Option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
- This is essentially an Earth-like planet
- Density would be approximately 5.5 g/cm³ (Earth's standard density)

3. Option b (2 Earth masses with density of 5.5 g/cm³):
- This suggests a more compact planet with similar density to Earth
- Density remains constant at 5.5 g/cm³

4. Option c (Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive):
- If composition is the same, the density will remain constant
- However, increased mass would require increased volume
- The density would remain approximately 5.5 g/cm³

5. Option d (Same composition as Earth, half the mass):
- Similar composition means density remains constant
- Smaller mass implies smaller volume
- Density still around 5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparing the options:
- All options have similar densities around 5.5 g/cm³
- Option b specifies a density of 5.5 g/cm³ directly

Therefore, the most precise answer is Option b.
