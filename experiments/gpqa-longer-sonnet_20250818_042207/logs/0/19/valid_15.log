=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:27,654 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) First, recall that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop momentum integration.

2) In the given expression, we need to look for clues about the loop order:
   - alpha^3 suggests some power of coupling constant
   - g^2 also indicates a coupling term
   - 1/(4pi)^6 is the most telling part

3) The factor 1/(4pi)^6 suggests this is a loop diagram because:
   - Each loop typically introduces a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 from momentum integration
   - 1/(4pi)^6 would correspond to 3 such loop integrations

4) Let's confirm the number of loops by checking the power of the denominator:
   - 1/(4pi)^6 = 1/(4pi)^(2 * 3)
   - This strongly indicates 3 loops

5) Other terms like (Q/M)^2 are typical scaling factors but don't change the loop count.

6) The presence of multiple coupling constants (alpha, g) also supports a multi-loop calculation.

Therefore, the diagram likely represents a 3-loop Feynman diagram.
