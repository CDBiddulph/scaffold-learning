=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG are the forward and reverse primers
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:56,439 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Identify the requirements:
- Need directional cloning into the expression vector
- Must use two different restriction enzymes
- Primers should allow enzyme sites to be added to the gene

2. Analyze the multiple cloning site (MCS):
- Contains HindIII and BamHI/KpnI sites
- These would allow directional cloning

3. Check the added restriction sites on the primers:
- The first base pairs must match the gene sequence
- Added restriction sites must be different
- The sites must match the vector's MCS

4. Analyze the options:
A) Forward primer: HindIII site (AAGCTT)
   Reverse primer: KpnI site (GGTACC)
   ✓ Different enzymes
   ✓ Matching vector MCS
   ✓ Preserves gene start and end

B) Forward primer: HindIII site
   Reverse primer: BamHI site (GGATCC)
   ✓ Different enzymes
   ✓ Matching vector MCS
   ✓ Preserves gene sequence

C) Forward primer: SmaI site (CCCGGG)
   Reverse primer: BamHI site
   ✗ SmaI not in vector MCS

D) Forward primer: BamHI site
   Reverse primer: HindIII site
   ✓ Different enzymes
   ✓ Matching vector MCS
   ✓ Preserves gene sequence

Therefore, the most suitable option is B.
