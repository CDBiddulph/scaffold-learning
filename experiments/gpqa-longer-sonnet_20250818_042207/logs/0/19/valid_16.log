=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development, causing mosaicism

2025-08-18 11:44:27,815 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the scenario:
- A scientist performed CRISPR gene editing on a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The embryo was transferred to a surrogate mother
- The resulting animal has different genomes in different cell lineages

2. Analysis of the possible causes:

Option A: Conversion of mRNA to cDNA
- This is unlikely because messenger RNA is typically not directly incorporated into the genome
- The process of converting mRNA to cDNA is complex and not spontaneous

Option B: Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation
- This is also improbable, as guide RNAs do not typically integrate into the genome themselves
- The mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 is precise DNA cutting and repair

Option C: Surrogate mother's DNA incorporation
- This scenario is highly implausible
- DNA from the surrogate mother would not randomly integrate into embryonic cells

Option D: Mosaicism due to ongoing Cas9 cutting
- This is the most scientifically sound explanation
- Cas9 can continue to cut DNA at different stages of embryo development
- Incomplete or variable gene editing during early cell divisions can lead to different genomic configurations in different cell lineages
- This phenomenon is known as genetic mosaicism in CRISPR editing

3. Conclusion: Option D best explains the observation of different genomes in different cell lineages.
