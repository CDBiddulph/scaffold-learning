=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:47,061 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Understanding the context:
- Satellites are detecting astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Analyzing localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests these are distant objects, not nearby objects
- Large angular uncertainty implies objects are very far away

3. Evaluating distance scales:
A) 1 million/1 billion light years 
- These are intergalactic distances
- Consistent with large angular uncertainty
- Realistic for distant astronomical objects

B) 1-100 thousand light years
- This is within our galaxy
- Possible, but smaller distances might have better localization

C) 10-100 light years
- Very close, within our solar neighborhood
- Too close to have such large localization uncertainty

D) 10 light minutes/100 light seconds
- These are extremely small distances
- Close to solar system scale
- Not consistent with astronomical object detection

4. Conclusion:
Option A provides the most scientifically plausible distance range for objects with large angular uncertainty and isotropic distribution.
