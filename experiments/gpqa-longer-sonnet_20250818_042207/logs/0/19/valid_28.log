=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin are correct terms in the described pathway

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:37,562 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. First, let's review the key terms in the Wnt3a signaling pathway:
- Wnt3a is a glycoprotein ligand
- Frizzled is the transmembrane receptor
- LRP5/6 is the co-receptor
- Beta-catenin is a critical protein that accumulates in cytoplasm
- Beta-catenin translocates to nucleus and acts as a transcriptional co-activator
- Without ligand binding, Beta-catenin is degraded by a destruction complex

2. Evaluating Option A:
- "Translocation into nucleus" ✓ Correct
- "Intracellular calcium" ✓ Correct
- "Destruction complex" ✓ Correct
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct

3. Evaluating Option B:
- "Proteosomal degradation" ✓ Correct (though misspelled)
- "N-terminal extracellular" ✓ Correct
- "Frizzled" ✓ Correct
- "Non-canonical" ✓ Correct

4. Evaluating Option C:
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct
- "Directly binds DNA" ✓ Correct
- "LRP5/6" ✓ Correct
- "Transmembrane receptor protein" ✓ Correct

5. Evaluating Option D:
- "Transcriptional co-activator" ✓ Correct
- "Glycoprotein" ✓ Correct
- "Accumulation in cytoplasm" ✓ Correct
- "Beta-catenin" ✓ Correct

6. All options contain correct terms. However, the question asks for the group with ONLY correct terms.

7. Option A is the most precise and contains only completely accurate terminology.
