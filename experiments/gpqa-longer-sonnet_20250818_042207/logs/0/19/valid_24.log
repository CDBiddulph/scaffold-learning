=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:36,903 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle type in 1e-5s:

Distance = Speed × Time
• Zeta: 0.96c × (1e-5s) = 0.96 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1e-5s) = 2880m
• Eta: 0.9c × (1e-5s) = 0.9 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1e-5s) = 2700m
• Chi: 0.88c × (1e-5s) = 0.88 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1e-5s) = 2640m
• Lambda: 0.93c × (1e-5s) = 0.93 × (3 × 10^8 m/s) × (1e-5s) = 2790m

2) Compare distance traveled to total height (13000m):
• Zeta: 2880m < 13000m
• Eta: 2700m < 13000m
• Chi: 2640m < 13000m
• Lambda: 2790m < 13000m

3) None will fully reach the ground. So we order by distance traveled.

4) Order from greatest distance to least:
Zeta (2880m) > Lambda (2790m) > Eta (2700m) > Chi (2640m)

5) This corresponds to the number of particles reaching the ground:
Zeta (30000 particles) > Lambda (24000 particles) > Eta (20000 particles) > Chi (19000 particles)

This matches option B: zeta > lambda > eta > chi
