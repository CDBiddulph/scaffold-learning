=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:44:36,986 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the key conditions:
- The wave function is time-independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Imaginary part is zero
- Probability in shell 1 (d1 to 2d1) is P
- Probability in shell 2 (2d1 to 3d1) is also P

2) In spherical coordinates, the probability of finding a particle in a spherical shell depends on:
- Volume of the shell
- Magnitude of the wave function squared

3) Volume of a spherical shell: 
V = 4π(r2³ - r1³)/3

4) Equal probability means the wave function's behavior must compensate for increasing shell volume.

5) Let Ψ(r) be the wave function. Probability ∝ |Ψ(r)|² * volume

6) If the shells have equal probability, then |Ψ(r)|² must decrease as volume increases

7) Shell volumes increase as r², so |Ψ(r)|² must decrease as 1/r²

8) This means Ψ(r) must have the form 1/r to yield 1/r² when squared

9) This directly corresponds to option A.
