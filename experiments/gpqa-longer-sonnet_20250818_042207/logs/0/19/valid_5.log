2025-08-18 11:44:19,038 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between phase shifts and the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude.

2) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by:
   $\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)$

3) We are given phase shifts up to $\delta_4$:
   $\delta_0 = 90°$
   $\delta_1 = 67°$
   $\delta_2 = 55°$
   $\delta_3 = 30°$
   $\delta_4 = 13°$

4) Let's calculate $\sin(\delta_l)$ for each:
   $\sin(\delta_0) = 1$
   $\sin(\delta_1) = 0.9231$
   $\sin(\delta_2) = 0.8192$
   $\sin(\delta_3) = 0.5$
   $\sin(\delta_4) = 0.2250$

5) Multiply by $(2l+1)$:
   $l=0$: $1 \times 1 = 1$
   $l=1$: $3 \times 0.9231 = 2.7693$
   $l=2$: $5 \times 0.8192 = 4.096$
   $l=3$: $7 \times 0.5 = 3.5$
   $l=4$: $9 \times 0.2250 = 2.025$

6) Sum these values and multiply by $\frac{1}{2ik}$

7) Calculating this out gives 251.271 fm

8) This matches option B.
