2025-08-18 11:44:55,123 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
- Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
- Higher energy = shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
- Lower energy = longer wavelength (red/orange/yellow end of spectrum)

2) The given energy is 2.3393 eV

3) To determine the color absorbed, we need to consider complementary colors:
- The color absorbed will be opposite/complementary to the color emitted

4) Energy conversion:
- 2.3393 eV corresponds to light in the visible spectrum
- This energy translates to wavelength around 530-550 nm
- This wavelength range corresponds to green light

5) Complementary color to green is red:
- When green light is emitted, red light is absorbed
- The complementary color relationship means the absorbed color is opposite on the color wheel

6) Looking at the options, "Red light is absorbed by the organic compound" directly matches our scientific reasoning

Therefore, the dye emits green light by absorbing red light.
