Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:44:36,384 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Conditions for optical activity:
- Requires a chiral carbon center (carbon with 4 different substituents)
- Must have at least one asymmetric carbon in the molecule

2. Composition analysis:
- All entries are saturated hydrocarbons (only C and H)
- Need to determine molecular formula from mass spectrum and elemental composition

3. Molecular analysis:
A) Molecular weight ≈ 72, likely C5H12 (pentane) - symmetric, NOT optically active
B) Molecular weight ≈ 86, likely C6H14 (hexane) - symmetric, NOT optically active
C) Molecular weight ≈ 58, likely C4H10 (butane) - symmetric, NOT optically active
D) Molecular weight ≈ 100, likely C7H16 (heptane)

4. Optical activity for heptane:
- C7H16 has potential for asymmetric carbons
- Specifically, 2-methylhexane or 3-methylhexane would have chiral centers
- These isomers would be optically active

5. Detailed reasoning points to option D as the correct answer.
