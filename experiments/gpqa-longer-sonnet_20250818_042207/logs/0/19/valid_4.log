=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:17,290 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using radioactive decay principles:

1) First, let's understand the initial decay probability:
- The atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes
- We have already waited 50 minutes, and it has not decayed yet

2) This suggests we are dealing with a probabilistic decay process, similar to radioactive decay

3) Conditional probability is key here:
- We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes

4) Let's calculate the probability of NOT decaying in the first 100 minutes:
- Original decay probability = 32%
- Probability of NOT decaying = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 or 68%

5) Given that the atom has survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability for decay in the next 150 minutes would be the complement of the survival probability

6) By statistical reasoning, this probability appears to be around 48%

7) Checking the options, 48% matches option A

Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is 48%.
