2025-08-18 11:44:36,858 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
m = M + 5 log(d/10), where:
m = apparent magnitude
M = absolute magnitude
d = distance in parsecs

2) For a single star with apparent magnitude 7 at 50 parsecs (option A):
- This is simply a star at a large distance, which would appear dimmer

3) For a single star with apparent magnitude 7 at 20 parsecs (option A):
- This is closer, so it would appear brighter

4) For the two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of 7 and 8 at 5 parsecs (option C):
- When combining star brightnesses, we use the logarithmic magnitude scale
- Combined magnitude would be brighter than either individual star
- Being at only 5 parsecs makes this system very bright

5) For a star with absolute magnitude 7 at 10 parsecs (option D):
- By definition, this star would have an apparent magnitude of 7

6) Comparing these, the two-star system at 5 parsecs will be the brightest.

Reasoning: Closer distance and multiple stars contribute to higher total brightness.
