=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:18,275 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, calculate the decay constant for Caesium-137:
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
- Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life ≈ 0.0007 per day

2. Calculate the number of decays per unit time:
- Total atoms = 10^17
- Decay rate = Number of atoms × decay constant
- This gives a high activity level

3. Calculate gamma-ray emission:
- Each radioactive decay typically emits multiple gamma-rays
- Assume 1-2 gamma-rays per decay event
- Over 80 minutes (1.33 hours), most of these atoms will decay

4. Detector considerations:
- Detector size: 2x3 cm = 6 cm²
- Distance: 4 meters creates a large solid angle
- Geometric efficiency affects detection probability

5. Estimating detected gamma-rays:
- With high activity and good detector positioning
- Likely in the range of 10^6 to 10^8 gamma-rays
- Most closely matches option C: 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays

The systematic approach points to a detection of approximately 1 million gamma-rays over 80 minutes.
