=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:27,558 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Mott-Gurney Equation:
- It describes the current flow in semiconductors under space-charge-limited conditions
- Specifically models current transport when charge carriers fill the device volume

2. Key Requirements for Validity:
- Single-carrier device: Only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes) is dominant
- Trap-free: No significant charge trapping that would disrupt carrier movement
- Negligible injection barriers at contacts
- Negligible diffusion current compared to drift current
- Ohmic contacts that allow uniform carrier injection

3. Analyzing the Options:
A) Mentions Ohmic contact ✓
   Mentions single-carrier device ✓
   Mentions negligible drift current ✓
   Most closely matches theoretical requirements

B) Similar to A, but specifies "no carrier injection barrier"
   This is slightly more restrictive than necessary

C) Mentions Schottky contact, which implies carrier injection barrier
   This would violate Mott-Gurney equation assumptions

D) Two-carrier device, which contradicts single-carrier requirement

4. Reasoning Conclusion:
Option A provides the most accurate description of Mott-Gurney equation's validity conditions.
