2025-08-18 11:44:17,189 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   - Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
   - Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5 × 10^10

2) The formation of Ca-EDTA complex is described by the equilibrium:
   Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

3) The stability constant is defined as:
   K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

4) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / (K[EDTA⁴⁻])

5) At equilibrium, if [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 M, we can use the stability constant to calculate free Ca²⁺:
   [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 / (5 × 10^10 × [EDTA⁴⁻])

6) Calculating:
   [Ca²⁺] = 6.3 × 10^-7 M

7) This matches option B.
