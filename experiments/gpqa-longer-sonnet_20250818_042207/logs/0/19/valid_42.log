=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up because the reaction is equilibrium-limited under the conditions used
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:56,752 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Scenario:
- The student is doing a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrocarbon reaction
- Current reaction conditions: 300°C
- Goal: Increase reactant conversion without losing selectivity
- Student has already tried varying catalyst amount/composition without success

2. Key Chemical Engineering Principles:
- Reaction conversion can be influenced by:
  a) Temperature
  b) Catalyst characteristics
  c) Reaction equilibrium
  d) Thermodynamic constraints

3. Analyzing the Options:
A) Incorrect - Prematurely giving up without exploring options
B) Partially correct, but lacks awareness of potential side reactions
C) Most comprehensive approach
   - Decreasing temperature can:
     * Shift equilibrium
     * Potentially improve conversion
     * Reduce side reactions
   - Warns about potential polymerization
D) Incorrect - Increasing temperature would likely:
   - Reduce conversion
   - Potentially cause unwanted polymerization
   - Decrease reaction selectivity

4. Detailed Reasoning for Option C:
- Lower temperatures can help overcome equilibrium limitations
- Increasing catalyst amount might improve reaction kinetics
- Awareness of polymerization shows scientific prudence
- Provides a systematic approach to problem-solving

5. Scientific Rationale:
The professor would advise a methodical, informed approach that considers both thermodynamic and kinetic factors.
