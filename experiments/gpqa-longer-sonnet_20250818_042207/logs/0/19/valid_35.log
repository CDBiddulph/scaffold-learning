=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH in single cells
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:47,136 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this systematically:

1. Hi-C Results:
- Significant interaction signal between promoter and enhancer
- Separated by ~1 Mb linear distance
- 50M cells used, suggesting statistical reliability

2. FISH Validation:
- Unable to confirm the interaction detected by Hi-C
- This suggests potential technical limitations

3. Additional Evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional relationship between the enhancer and promoter

4. Possible Explanations:
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH detection
- FISH requires higher local concentration of interaction
- Hi-C averages signals across millions of cells
- Low-frequency interactions might be missed in single-cell FISH

B) Structural variation affecting distance
- Possible, but less likely given the precise 1 Mb measurement

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH
- Inconsistent with 1 Mb distance

D) False-positive Hi-C signal
- Less likely given the functional validation by dCas9-KRAB experiment

5. Reasoning Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the interaction is present but at a low frequency that Hi-C can detect across populations, but FISH cannot reliably capture in single cells.
