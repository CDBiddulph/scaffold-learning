=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137 is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:46,418 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's interpret "smallest attainable charge and mass":
- This suggests we're talking about fundamental particles
- The elementary charge is e = 1.602 Ã— 10^-19 C
- Fundamental charge would be the key reference here

2) For point charges, we know two forces act simultaneously:
- Gravitational attraction (proportional to masses)
- Electrostatic force (proportional to charges)

3) Gravitational force: F_g = G(m1m2)/r^2
- G is gravitational constant
- m1, m2 are masses
- r is separation distance

4) Electrostatic force: F_e = k(q1q2)/r^2
- k is Coulomb's constant
- q1, q2 are charges
- r is separation distance

5) The question specifically asks about the ratio of repulsive to attractive force strengths

6) Critically, the distance is 137 meters
- This suggests a proportionality relationship of 1/137^2

7) Calculating force strengths involves detailed physics, but proportionality follows inverse square law

8) The ratio that matches this reasoning is 1/137^2

Therefore:
