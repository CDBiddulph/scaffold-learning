2025-08-18 11:44:46,431 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what a Cope rearrangement is:
- It's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement involving the migration of groups in a conjugated diene system
- It typically occurs at high temperatures
- Maintains stereochemistry of substituents

2) Look at the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene:
- Contains a nitrogen atom
- Has a bicyclic structure
- Has a vinyl group
- Has specific stereochemistry at carbons

3) During Cope rearrangement:
- The vinyl group and the double bond will rearrange
- This leads to a new ring connectivity
- The nitrogen remains part of the ring

4) Analyzing the options:
- Each option represents a different cyclopenta[c]pyridine isomer
- The numbers represent the carbons involved in the rearrangement

5) Careful examination of the structure suggests that the rearrangement will produce a new ring system that maintains the nitrogen and creates a cyclopenta[c]pyridine structure.

6) After detailed analysis, option D looks most consistent with the expected Cope rearrangement product.
