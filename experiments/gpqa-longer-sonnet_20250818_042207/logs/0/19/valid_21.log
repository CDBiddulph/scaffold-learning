=== INPUT ===
S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one is the structure of product 4

2025-08-18 11:44:35,360 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDSCl + Et3N
- This protects the hydroxyl group with a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) group
- Creates a silyl ether derivative

2) Ph2CuLi at low temperature, then benzyl bromide
- Organocuprate reagent adds a phenyl group
- Benzyl bromide introduces a benzyl substituent
- Creates a new carbon-carbon bond

3) LDA and iodomethane at low temperature
- Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is a strong base
- Performs alpha-methylation
- Adds a methyl group at the alpha position

4) Aqueous HCl treatment
- Removes the TBDMS protecting group
- Restores the hydroxyl group

Carefully analyzing the reaction sequence and stereochemistry, the structure that best matches these transformations is:

(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
