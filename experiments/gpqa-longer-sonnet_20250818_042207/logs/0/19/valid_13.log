2025-08-18 11:44:26,636 [INFO] LLM response: Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory

2. Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):
- This is a fundamental symmetry in relativistic field theories
- It describes how physics looks the same in different inertial reference frames
- SMEFT must respect this symmetry by construction
- ✓ TRUE

3. Poincare Symmetry (Option 2):
- This includes both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
- Also a fundamental requirement for relativistic quantum field theories
- SMEFT must respect this symmetry
- ✓ TRUE

4. CP Symmetry (Option 3):
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
- NOT universally respected in SMEFT
- Violated by some weak interactions
- ✗ FALSE

5. CPT Symmetry (Option 4):
- Combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal
- A fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories
- Must be respected by all fundamental interactions
- ✓ TRUE

6. Comparing the options:
- Options 1, 2, and 4 are definitely respected
- Option 3 (CP) is not universally respected

Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correct.
