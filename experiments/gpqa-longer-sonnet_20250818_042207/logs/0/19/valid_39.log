=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers in the PFA-only IKAROS ChIP-seq dataset

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:44:47,021 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Understanding the context:
- ChIP-seq is used to map protein-DNA interactions
- IKAROS is a key transcription factor in B cell development
- Two different fixation methods are compared (PFA alone vs. PFA+DSG)
- Peaks "disappear" with the additional DSG crosslinking

2. Crosslinking considerations:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) creates short-range protein-DNA crosslinks
- DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) creates longer-range and more stable crosslinks
- Disappearing peaks suggest these are weak or transient interactions

3. Most likely location analysis:
- Random locations (A) would not show systematic peak loss
- Repeats (B) are often difficult to map precisely
- Large gene introns (C) are less likely sites of direct transcription factor binding

4. Active promoters and enhancers:
- Transcription factors like IKAROS often have dynamic, weak interactions
- These regions have high transcriptional activity
- Transient interactions might be disrupted by more stringent crosslinking
- Consistent with known transcription factor binding characteristics

5. Conclusion: The most likely location for disappearing peaks is active promoters and enhancers.
