=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:49:48,981 [INFO] Response preview: Let's solve this systematically:

1) First, analyze the system configuration:
• 12 charges (2e) are positioned in a circle 2m from point P
• The 13th charge (2e) is at point P itself
• We need to calc...
