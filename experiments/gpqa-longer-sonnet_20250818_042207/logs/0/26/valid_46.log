=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 11:50:16,469 [INFO] Response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak energy to temperature:
   Temperature ∝ Peak Energy

2) For star A: Peak Energy = 7.21 eV
   For the sun: Peak Ene...
