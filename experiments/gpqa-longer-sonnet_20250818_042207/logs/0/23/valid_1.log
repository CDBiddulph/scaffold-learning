=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:31,816 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand Caesium-137's decay properties:
• Half-life is about 30 years
• Emits gamma rays during decay
• Strong gamma radiation source

2. Calculate decay rate:
• Total atoms: 10^17
• Decay constant relates to half-life
• Per 80 minutes, a significant fraction will decay

3. Gamma ray emission:
• Each decaying atom typically emits 1-2 gamma rays
• Detector area: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• At 4 meters distance, detector covers a small solid angle of total radiatio...
