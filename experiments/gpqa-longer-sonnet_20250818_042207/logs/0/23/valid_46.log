=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 11:48:07,612 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak wavelength (or energy) to temperature:
   T ∝ 1/λ_peak or T ∝ E_peak

2) For star A, peak energy is 7.21 eV
   For the sun, peak energy is 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio: 7.21/1.41 = 5.11
   So star A is about 5.11 times hotter than the sun

4) Recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity ∝ R² × T⁴
   Star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

5) Let's set up the equation:
   24 = (R/R_sun)² × (5.11)⁴

6) Sol...
