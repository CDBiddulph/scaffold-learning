=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:30,801 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the problem setup:
• Total decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay
• We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2. The key insight is conditional probability: Given that the atom has NOT decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's its probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes?

3. This scenario suggests a "memoryless" exponential decay process, where the remaining decay pr...
