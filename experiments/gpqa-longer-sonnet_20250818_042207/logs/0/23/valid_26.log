2025-08-18 11:47:48,762 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between angular size (θ), distance (d), and physical size (R):
   θ (in radians) = R/d

2) We know:
   • d = 10^10 parsecs
   • θ = 10^-17 degrees = (10^-17 * π/180) radians

3) Rearranging the equation, the radius of the event horizon will be:
   R = θ * d

4) The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon area.
   S ∝ R^2

5) Calculating:
   R = (10^-17 * π/180) * 10^10 parsecs
     ≈ 10^-7 parsecs
     ≈ 10^15...
