=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one, the elimination product from 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol indicated by the 1690 cm^-1 IR band
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:58,121 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol, which has two hydroxyl (-OH) groups

2. The reaction conditions involve acid, which typically causes elimination reactions

3. The IR absorption at 1690 cm^-1 is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch

4. In an acid-catalyzed elimination of a diol, we would expect:
   - Loss of water
   - Formation of a ketone or an alkene

5. Let's analyze the options:
   A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one: Incorrect struct...
