=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne as product C
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

2025-08-18 11:47:40,030 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze Compound A (C6H13Br):
- 3 signals: 1 singlet and 2 triplets
- Suggests 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane
- Contains a tert-butyl group (singlet) and alkyl chain (triplets)

2. Analyze Compound B (C4H6):
- 3 signals: 1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet
- Suggests but-1-yne (acetylenic compound)

3. Analyze Compound C (C10H18):
- 5 signals: 1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet
- Consistent with a nucleophilic substitution reaction

4. Reaction mechanism:
- Nucleophilic ...
