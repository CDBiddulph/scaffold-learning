=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3% mass fraction of HHal acid in the resulting products
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:48:08,170 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial mixture and product composition:
   - Initial volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
   - Volume ratio of A:B = 1:1
   - Products are water and HHal acid

2) Density comparison:
   - Density of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11
   - Volume ratio of A:B is 1:1

3) Let's determine the composition of A and B:
   - Assume A and B have masses m and 2.11m respectively
   - Since volumes are equal, this suggests these gases have differen...
