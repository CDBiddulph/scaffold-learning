=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B) 251.271 fm is the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction
C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

2025-08-18 11:47:31,651 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts by the optical theorem.

2) The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section.

3) The specific formula is:
   Im(f(0)) = (k/π) Σ(2l+1)sin(2δ_l)

4) Here, k is the wave number, and l runs from 0 to 4.

5) Let's calculate sin(2δ_l) for each phase shift:
   • sin(2δ_0) = sin(180°) = 0
   • sin(2δ_1) = sin...
