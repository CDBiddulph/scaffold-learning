=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:39,587 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the system configuration:
   • 12 charges of 2e are positioned at 2 m from point P
   • 1 charge of 2e is fixed at point P
   • These are all identical charges

2) Calculate the Coulomb constant (k):
   k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Charge of each particle:
   q = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19 C) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

4) Potential energy between the charge at P and the 12 charges:
   • Each charge is 2 m from P
   • U = k × (q at P) × (q at 2m) ...
