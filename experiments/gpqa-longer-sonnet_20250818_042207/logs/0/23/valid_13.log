2025-08-18 11:47:40,326 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which means the operators must respect fundamental symmetries.

2. Lorentz symmetry (option 1):
- This is a fundamental requirement for any relativistic field theory
- SMEFT must respect how spacetime transformations work
- MUST be respected

3. Poincare symmetry (option 2):
- This includes translations and Lorentz transformations
- Essentially a broader version of Lorentz symmetry
- MUST be respected
