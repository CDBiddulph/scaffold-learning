=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:49,361 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The wave function is spherically symmetric and time-independent, with no imaginary part.

2) The question states that the probability of finding the particle in two different shells (d1-2d1 and 2d1-3d1) is equal at P.

3) The probability depends on two factors:
   - The wave function amplitude squared
   - The volume of the shell

4) Shell volume is proportional to r² dr

5) If the wave function is ψ(r), the probability is proportional to |ψ(r)|² * r² dr

6) Fo...
