What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-18 11:47:30,876 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   • Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
   • Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5 × 10^10

2) The equilibrium reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

3) The stability constant is defined as:
   K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

4) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / (K × [EDTA⁴⁻])

5) Given [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 M, we can calculate [Ca²⁺]:
   [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 / (5 × 10^10 × 0.02)
           = 0.0...
