Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:47:44,152 [INFO] Found 4 options
2025-08-18 11:47:49,971 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. For a saturated hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must:
• Have a molecular formula consistent with a saturated hydrocarbon
• Contain at least one chiral center (asymmetric carbon)

2. Analyze the elemental composition:
• All options show approximately 83-84% C and 16-17% H
• This suggests they are hydrocarbons

3. Consider molecular mass from EI-MS peaks:
• A: m/z suggests a molecule around C5H12
• B: m/z suggests a molecule around C6H14
• C: m/z suggests ...
