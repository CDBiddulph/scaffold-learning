=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:59,511 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the problem involves light propagating through a moving glass medium.

2) The speed of light in vacuum is given as c = 1.

3) The index of refraction of the glass is n, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the direction of the light beam.

4) To find the speed of light relative to the observer, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

5) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v/cÂ²)
   Where u...
