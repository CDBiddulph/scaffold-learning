2025-08-18 11:47:31,031 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what happens in this reaction:
• The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
• It's being treated with red phosphorus and excess HI
• This typically indicates a reduction/deoxygenation reaction

2. Let's analyze the structural changes:
• The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a CH2 group
• The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a CH2 group
• The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to -CH2-CH...
