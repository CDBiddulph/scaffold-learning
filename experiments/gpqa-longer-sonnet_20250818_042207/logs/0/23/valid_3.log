a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.
c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

2025-08-18 11:47:31,214 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume.

2. Option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
• This would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)
• Density is constant if mass and volume scale proportionally

3. Option b (2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ density):
• Implies the planet maintains the same density as Earth
• Suggests volume has increased proportionally with mass

4. Option c (Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive):
• If composi...
