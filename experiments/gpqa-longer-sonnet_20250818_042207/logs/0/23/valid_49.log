=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet for the most deshielded hydrogen in 2
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:48:08,928 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV radiation:
   - This suggests a photochemical reaction
   - Since the molecular weight remains the same, likely a rearrangement or cyclization occurs

2) The most probable photochemical reaction is a photochemical Norrish Type II reaction:
   - This involves breaking a C-C bond adjacent to the carbonyl
   - Creates a diradical intermediate that rearranges

3) The subsequent hydrogenation with Pd/C under H2:...
