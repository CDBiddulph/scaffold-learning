=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in bromination of the given benzene derivatives
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:49,328 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituents already present on the benzene ring influence the orientation of the incoming bromine.

2) Substituents are classified as:
- Activating ortho/para directors: -CH3, -C2H5
- Deactivating meta directors: -NO2, -COOH
- Weak deactivating ortho/para directors: -Cl, -COOC2H5

3) For activating groups like -CH3 and -C2H5, the para product is heavily favored.

4) For deactivating groups like -NO2, the meta product...
