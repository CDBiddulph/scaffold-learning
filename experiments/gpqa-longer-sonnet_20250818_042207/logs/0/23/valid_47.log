=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference for multi-Higgs-doublet models

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:48:07,905 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) are used to parametrize possible new physics contributions in precision electroweak measurements.

2. In multi-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM or more), the quantum corrections can be more complex due to additional scalar particles.

3. Breit-Wigner corrections relate to the resonance line shape of particles and can modify the standard oblique parameters.

4. The key question is whether these corrections significantly improve ...
