S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D) (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one is the structure of product 4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:48,766 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (TBS protection):
• S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one gets protected with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride
• This protects the hydroxyl group

2) Second reaction (Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide):
• This adds a phenyl group and a benzyl group to the molecule
• Creates a new carbon-carbon bond

3) Third reaction (LDA and iodomethane):
• LDA deprotonates the molecule
• Iodomethane adds a methyl group
• Creates a new stereocenter with a methyl group

4) Fi...
