2025-08-18 11:48:07,135 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
• Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
• Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength/higher frequency colors
• Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength/lower frequency colors

2. The dye emits light with 2.3393 eV of energy
• This means it has absorbed a complementary/opposite color on the color wheel

3. Convert energy to wavelength:
• E = hc/λ
• 2.3393 eV corresponds to ...
