=== INPUT ===
9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride is the product
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:47:38,981 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The reactants are 9-fluorenone and selectfluor, which is known to perform fluorination reactions.

2. The light irradiation at 400nm suggests a photochemical reaction.

3. The 19F NMR shows two fluorine signals:
   • +29.8 ppm
   • -115.7 ppm

4. This suggests two different fluorine environments in the molecule.

5. Looking at the structure of 9-fluorenone, the most likely sites for fluorination are at the 2 and 6 positions.

6. A 2,6-difluorination would creat...
