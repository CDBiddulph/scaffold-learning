2025-08-18 11:47:58,595 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what a Cope rearrangement is:
   - It's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement
   - Involves the migration of groups in a symmetric manner
   - Typically occurs at elevated temperatures

2) Looking at the starting molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene:
   - It has a bicyclic structure
   - Contains a vinyl group
   - Contains a nitrogen atom in the ring

3) In a Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group will migrate to a new positi...
