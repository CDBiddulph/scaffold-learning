2025-08-18 11:31:29,940 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the decay properties of Caesium-137
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
• It decays by emitting beta particles and gamma rays

2) Calculate decay rate (radioactivity)
• Number of atoms = 10^17
• Decay constant λ = ln(2)/T1/2
• Activity = Number of atoms × Decay constant
• Activity ≈ 10^17 × (ln(2) / (30 × 365 × 24 × 3600)) decays/second

3) Gamma ray emission
• Not all decays produce gamma rays
• Cs-137 has about 0.85 gamma rays per decay
• Time interval = 80 minutes = 4800 seconds

4) Detector considerations
• Detector size: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance: 4 meters
• Solid angle calculation would reduce detected gamma rays

5) Rough estimation
• Accounting for geometric factors and gamma ray probability
• About 10^6 gamma rays detected seems reasonable

6) Comparing to given choices, this matches choice C.

Answer: C

The solution involves decay rate calculation, probability considerations, and geometric detection factors.
