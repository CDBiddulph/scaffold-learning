A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:31:43,397 [INFO] Answer choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-18 11:31:49,787 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Conditions for an optically active saturated hydrocarbon:
• Must have an asymmetric carbon center (chiral carbon)
• Contain a single chiral carbon with four different substituents
• Carbon % should be consistent with hydrocarbon composition

2. Analyze elemental composition:
• Typical saturated hydrocarbon formula is CnH2n+2
• Calculate expected carbon/hydrogen ratios

3. Examine each composition:
A) C 83.33%, H 16.66%
   - Not consistent with standard hydrocarbon ratios
   - Unlikely to have chiral center

B) C 83.72%, H 16.27%
   - Close to standard hydrocarbon ratio
   - Suggests potential for chiral structure
   - Requires further investigation of molecular structure

C) C 82.75%, H 17.25%
   - Ratio slightly off from standard hydrocarbon composition
   - Less likely to be optically active

D) C 84%, H 16%
   - Ratio deviates significantly from expected hydrocarbon composition

4. Additional information: EI-MS m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43
   - Suggests fragmentation pattern of branched hydrocarbon
   - Supports potential for chiral center

5. Conclusion: Option B appears most consistent with optically active saturated hydrocarbon characteristics.
