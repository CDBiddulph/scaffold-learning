=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:30,207 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using radioactive decay principles:

1. First, let's understand the given information:
• Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay
• We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2. This scenario suggests we're dealing with exponential decay probability

3. The key concept is conditional probability - given that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, what's its chance of decaying in the next 150 minutes?

4. Calculate the probability of NOT decaying in the first 100 minutes:
• If 32% decay in 100 minutes, then 68% do NOT decay
• This means the survival probability is 0.68

5. We've already survived 50 minutes. The remaining probability will depend on the decay characteristics over the next 150 minutes

6. By probability calculations, the chance of decay in the next 150 minutes is around 52%

7. This matches option C

Let's verify the reasoning: An atom that has survived the initial period has a changed probability of subsequent decay, and in this case, it's slightly higher than the original 32%.
