2025-08-18 11:31:39,556 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT means:
• SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• It's a framework for describing physics beyond the Standard Model

2. Let's analyze each symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
• Fundamental to all relativistic quantum field theories
• Describes how physics looks the same in different inertial reference frames
• MUST be respected by all SMEFT operators
• REQUIRED

Poincaré Symmetry:
• Combines Lorentz symmetry with spacetime translations
• Also fundamental to relativistic field theories
• MUST be respected by all SMEFT operators
• REQUIRED

CP Symmetry:
• Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
• Not universally required in SMEFT
• Can be violated in some extensions

CPT Symmetry:
• Combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T)
• A fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories
• MUST be respected by all SMEFT operators
• REQUIRED

3. Analyzing the constraints: Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT symmetries are essential.
