=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers in the PFA-only IKAROS ChIP-seq dataset

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:58,843 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the experimental setup:
- ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) was performed
- Two fixation methods were used: PFA-only and PFA+DSG
- The IKAROS transcription factor was the target
- Some peaks disappeared when DSG was added to the fixation

2. Consider the nature of DSG (Disuccinimidyl glutarate):
- DSG is a chemical crosslinker that creates stronger, more extensive protein-protein and protein-DNA crosslinks
- More stringent crosslinking can disrupt weaker or transient interactions

3. Implications for ChIP-seq peaks:
- Disappearing peaks suggest weak or transient interactions
- These interactions are likely disrupted by more extensive crosslinking

4. Consider the likely locations of such peaks:
- Weak/transient interactions are characteristic of transcription factors at regulatory regions
- Active promoters and enhancers are dynamic sites of transcription factor binding
- Such regions often involve short-lived, dynamic protein interactions

5. Conclusion:
- The most likely location for these disappearing peaks is active promoters and enhancers
