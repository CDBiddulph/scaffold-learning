2025-08-18 11:31:48,978 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
S = kA/(4l_p²)
Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the surface area of the event horizon, and l_p is the Planck length

2) Angular size (θ) relates to the radius of the event horizon (R) and distance (d):
θ = R/d
Rearranging: R = θ * d

3) Given:
θ = 10^-17 degrees
d = 10^10 parsecs
(1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters)

4) Calculate event horizon radius:
R = 10^-17 * (10^10 * 3 * 10^16) meters
  ≈ 3 * 10^9 meters

5) Surface area of event horizon:
A = 4πR² 
  ≈ 4π * (3 * 10^9)²
  ≈ 10^20 m²

6) Using Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula with estimates:
S ≈ 10^62 J/K

7) This matches choice C.
