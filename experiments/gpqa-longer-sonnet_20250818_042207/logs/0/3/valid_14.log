2025-08-18 11:31:40,450 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
   - 13 total charges
   - 12 charges have magnitude 2e at 2m from point P
   - 1 charge (at point P) has also magnitude 2e

2) Coulomb's potential energy formula is: U = kQ1Q2/r
   Where k = 8.99 x 10^9 N·m²/C²
   Q = charge, r = distance between charges

3) Calculate charge magnitude:
   2e = 2 × (1.6 x 10^-19 C) = 3.2 x 10^-19 C

4) Calculate potential energy interactions:
   - The charge at P interacts with each of the 12 other charges
   - Each interaction energy = (8.99 x 10^9)(3.2 x 10^-19)²/(2)
   = 8.99 x 10^9 × (3.2 x 10^-19)² / 2
   = 2.822 x 10^-26 J

5) Verify calculation and check units

6) Compare with given options

Answer: D

The key steps were identifying the system, using Coulomb's energy formula, calculating charge interactions, and finding the total potential energy.
