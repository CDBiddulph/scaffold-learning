=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:39,381 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams represent interactions between particles, and the complexity of the diagram is characterized by the number of loops.

2) The number of loops in a Feynman diagram corresponds to the number of independent closed particle paths through the diagram.

3) While the diagram itself is unreadable, the key information is in the dimensionless scaling factor.

4) Let's analyze the power scaling: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

5) In quantum field theory, the power of a loop diagram scales as the number of loops squared (or higher power).

6) The denominator (4pi)^6 suggests a power consistent with higher loop contributions.

7) Specifically, the (4pi)^6 factor implies a scaling consistent with approximately 3 loops.

8) The other factors (alpha^3, g^2, (Q/M)^2) support a contribution from a multi-loop diagram.

9) By dimensional analysis and power counting, this strongly suggests 3 loops.

Answer: D) 3 loops
