2025-08-18 11:32:08,203 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
• This is a bicyclic ketone with a rigid cage-like structure

2. UV irradiation → Product 1
• UV light can cause photochemical reactions like [2+2] cycloadditions
• Since molecular weight remains the same, likely a photochemical rearrangement occurs
• Suggests a photochemical transformation within the molecule

3. Pd/C + H2 → Product 2
• This suggests a hydrogenation reaction
• Palladium on carbon is a standard catalyst for reducing ketones to alcohols
• Hydrogen atmosphere indicates reduction of the ketone to an alcohol

4. 1H NMR splitting pattern
• The most deshielded hydrogen likely near the original carbonyl region
• After reduction, this hydrogen would be adjacent to the hydroxyl group
• Stereochemistry of the molecule will determine the splitting pattern
• Given the rigid cage structure, this hydrogen is likely in a unique chemical environment

5. Splitting pattern analysis
• The presence of neighboring hydrogens will determine the splitting
• A doublet suggests two equivalent neighboring hydrogens
• A doublet of doublets suggests two non-equivalent neighboring hydrogens

6. Conclusion: The most likely splitting pattern is a doublet of doublets.
