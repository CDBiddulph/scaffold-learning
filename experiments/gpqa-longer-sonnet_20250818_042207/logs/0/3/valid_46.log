2025-08-18 11:32:08,910 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the relevant scientific principles:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law, which relates the peak wavelength/energy of a blackbody to its temperature:
• λ_max * T = constant
• Or equivalently, E_peak ∝ T

2) The peak energy for the sun is 1.41 eV, and for star A is 7.21 eV
• Ratio of peak energies = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11
• This indicates star A's surface is about 5.11 times hotter than the sun's

3) We know the star's luminosity is proportional to radius squared and temperature to the fourth power:
• L ∝ R² * T⁴

4) We're told star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

5) Let's set up the luminosity equation:
• 24 = (R/R_sun)² * (T/T_sun)⁴

6) From temperature (step 2), T/T_sun = 5.11

7) Substituting and solving:
• 24 = (R/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴
• 24 = (R/R_sun)² * 600
• (R/R_sun)² = 24/600
• R/R_sun = √(24/600)
• R/R_sun = 0.20

8) The closest answer is 0.19
