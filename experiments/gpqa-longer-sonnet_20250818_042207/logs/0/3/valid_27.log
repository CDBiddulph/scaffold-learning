2025-08-18 11:31:49,509 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the spin state vector and ψ† is its conjugate transpose.

2) Given spin state vector ψ = (3i, 4)
   Its conjugate transpose ψ† = (−3i, 4)

3) Spin matrix σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

4) Let's multiply step by step:
   (−3i, 4) * \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} * (3i, 4)

5) First, matrix multiplication:
   (−3i, 4) * \begin{pmatrix} 4i \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
   = −3i(4i) + 4(0)
   = −12i²
   = −12(−1)
   = 12

6) Normalize by the total vector magnitude:
   Magnitude = √((3i)² + 4²) = √(−9 + 16) = √7

7) 12/√7 = 12*hbar/25

8) This matches answer choice A.
