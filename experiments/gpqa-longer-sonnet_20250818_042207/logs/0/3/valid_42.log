=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up because the reaction is equilibrium-limited under the conditions used
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:32:08,437 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Situation:
- The student has conducted a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction
- The reaction is at 300°C
- Current experiments have not increased conversion
- Need to improve conversion without losing selectivity

2. Thermodynamic Considerations:
- Equilibrium-limited reactions are typically affected by temperature changes
- Le Chatelier's principle suggests that temperature modifications can shift reaction equilibrium

3. Analyzing the Options:
A) Accepting results implies no further improvement is possible
B) Suggests decreasing temperature and increasing catalyst amount
C) Similar to B, but with awareness of potential polymerization
D) Suggests increasing temperature and decreasing catalyst amount

4. Scientific Reasoning:
- Decreasing temperature often shifts equilibrium towards product formation
- Increasing catalyst amount can improve reaction kinetics
- Polymerization is a potential side reaction to be cautious about

5. Detailed Analysis:
- Option B seems most scientifically sound
- Lowering temperature can:
  * Shift equilibrium towards products
  * Reduce potential side reactions
- Increasing catalyst amount can improve conversion without changing selectivity

6. Conclusion:
Option B provides the most logical approach to improving reaction conversion while maintaining scientific rigor.

Answer: B
