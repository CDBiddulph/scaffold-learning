2025-08-18 11:31:49,260 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the key relationship for stellar brightness:
- Apparent magnitude depends on both the star's intrinsic brightness and its distance
- More negative (lower) apparent magnitude means brighter star
- Distance affects brightness via the distance modulus equation

2) For single stars with given apparent magnitude at different distances:
- 20 parsec star at 7 mag: Not the brightest
- 50 parsec star at 7 mag: Even dimmer due to greater distance

3) For the absolute magnitude star at 10 parsecs:
- At 10 parsecs, absolute and apparent magnitude are equivalent
- This star's V magnitude would be 7

4) For two-star systems, brightness depends on individual magnitudes and total system flux
- Two-star system at 5 parsecs with Vmag 7 and 8:
   * Closer distance means brighter
   * Combined flux will be brighter than individual stars

5) For two-star system at 10 parsecs with both Vmag 7:
- Same intrinsic brightness
- Equal contribution to system brightness

6) Comparing options, the 5 parsec two-star system (option C) will appear brightest due to:
- Closer distance
- Combined flux from two stars
