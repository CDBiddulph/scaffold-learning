=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development, causing mosaicism

2025-08-18 11:31:40,223 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the key observation:
- The scientist found different DNA sequences in cells from different tissues of the transgenic animal
- This suggests genetic modification did not occur uniformly across all cells during embryo development

2. Consider the characteristics of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing:
- Gene editing occurs at specific stages of early embryo development
- If gene editing is incomplete or occurs at different times, it can lead to mosaicism
- Mosaicism means some cells have the genetic modification while others do not

3. Analyze the potential causes for this mosaicism:
- Option A: cDNA conversion is unlikely and not a typical mechanism
- Option B: Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation is not a standard mechanism
- Option C: Surrogate mother DNA incorporation is not a plausible explanation
- Option D: Continuous Cas9 protein cutting and donor DNA incorporation at different embryo development stages is a known mechanism that can cause mosaicism

4. Evaluate Option D:
- Cas9 protein can continue to cut DNA in early embryo cells
- This can lead to donor DNA incorporation at different developmental stages
- Incomplete or staggered gene editing results in cells with different genetic compositions

5. Conclusion:
The most probable cause of different genomes in different cell lineages is continuous Cas9 protein activity leading to varied gene editing across embryo development stages.
