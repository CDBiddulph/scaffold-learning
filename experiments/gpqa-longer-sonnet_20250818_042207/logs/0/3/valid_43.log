=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG are the forward and reverse primers
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:32:08,351 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, analyze the multiple cloning site (MCS) on the expression vector:
- Contains restriction sites: SmaI, HindIII, BglII, KpnI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI
- We want to choose enzymes that will allow directional cloning

2. Analyze the given options for primer design:
- Each primer contains a restriction enzyme recognition site followed by part of the gene sequence
- We want to choose enzyme sites that match those in the MCS

3. Consider the cloning strategy requirements:
- We need two different restriction enzymes
- The enzymes should be compatible with the MCS
- The primers should allow directional cloning with the correct orientation

4. Compare the options:
- Option A uses HindIII (forward) and KpnI (reverse)
- Option B uses HindIII (forward) and BamHI (reverse)
- Option C uses SmaI (forward) and BamHI (reverse)
- Option D uses BamHI (forward) and HindIII (reverse)

5. Key observations:
- Option D provides a directional cloning strategy
- BamHI and HindIII are different enzymes
- They match sites in the MCS
- The primers flank the entire gene sequence

6. Conclusion:
Option D provides the most suitable primer design for directional cloning.
