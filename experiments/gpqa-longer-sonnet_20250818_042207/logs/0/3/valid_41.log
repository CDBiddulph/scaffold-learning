2025-08-18 11:32:07,634 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the relationship between light energy and wavelength:
• Energy (E) = h * f (Planck's equation)
• Energy (E) = hc/λ (where h = Planck's constant, c = speed of light, λ = wavelength)

2. We're given the energy is 2.3393 eV. Let's convert this to Joules:
• 1 eV = 1.6 × 10^-19 J
• 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * (1.6 × 10^-19) J = 3.74288 × 10^-19 J

3. Rearrange the equation to solve for wavelength:
• λ = hc/E
• λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 J*s)(3 × 10^8 m/s) / (3.74288 × 10^-19 J)
• λ ≈ 530 nm

4. 530 nm corresponds to green-yellow wavelengths in the visible spectrum

5. Complementary color to green-yellow is violet-blue

6. Therefore, the compound will absorb violet-blue light.
