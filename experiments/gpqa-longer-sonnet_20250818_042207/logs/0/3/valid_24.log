=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:51,451 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The key factor here is how many particles will reach the ground in 1e-5s. This depends on two things:
   - Speed of the particles
   - Time to reach the ground (which is determined by their relativistic time dilation)

2) Distance to ground = 13000m

3) Let's calculate time to reach ground for each particle using Lorentz time dilation:
   t' = t / √(1 - v²/c²)

4) Zeta (0.96c):
   - Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-(0.96)²) = 2.94
   - Time to ground = 13000 / (0.96c) = 4.51e-5s × 2.94 = 1.33e-5s
   - Particles reaching ground: 30000 × (1e-5/1.33e-5) = 22,556

5) Eta (0.9c):
   - Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-(0.9)²) = 2.29
   - Time to ground = 13000 / (0.9c) = 4.81e-5s × 2.29 = 1.10e-5s
   - Particles reaching ground: 20000 × (1e-5/1.10e-5) = 18,182

6) Chi (0.88c):
   - Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-(0.88)²) = 2.0
   - Time to ground = 13000 / (0.88c) = 4.95e-5s × 2.0 = 9.90e-5s
   - Particles reaching ground: 19000 × (1e-5/9.90e-5) = 1,919

7) Lambda (0.93c):
   - Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1-(0.93)²) = 2.57
   - Time to ground = 13000 / (0.93c) = 4.68e-5s × 2.57 = 1.20e-5s
   - Particles reaching ground: 24000 × (1e-5/1.20e-5) = 20,000

8) Ordering from most to least: zeta > lambda > eta > chi
