=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle, since the C-NOT here flips the target when the control is \left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 11:31:30,231 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate:
   - It operates on two qubits: a control qubit and a target qubit
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped
   - If the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged

2) In the given input state |ψ⟩:
   - The first part is (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)
   - The second part is |0⟩

3) The condition states that the control qubit (first qubit) is |0⟩

4) When the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged

5) So the output will have the same first part: (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)
   And the target qubit will remain |0⟩

6) Looking at the options, this matches option A exactly

7) Option A preserves the superposition of the first register and keeps the target qubit at |0⟩

Answer: A

Explanation:
- The C-NOT gate does not change the state when the control qubit is |0⟩
- Therefore, the output is identical to the input state
