=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in bromination of the given benzene derivatives
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:50,148 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by understanding the key factors that influence para-substitution in electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent Effects on Directing Orientation:
- Para directors (electron-donating groups): C6H5-CH3, C6H5-C2H5, C6H5-COOC2H5
- Meta directors (electron-withdrawing groups): C6H5-NO2, C6H5-COOH
- Halogen (deactivating, but ortho/para directing): C6H5-Cl

2) Quantitative Para Directing Strength:
- Alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl): Strong para directors
- Ester groups: Moderate para directors
- Carboxylic acid: Weak para/meta director
- Chloro: Moderate para director
- Nitro: Strong meta director

3) Analyzing Each Substance:
- Nitro group (4): Almost exclusively meta directing
- Carboxylic acid (6): Weak directivity
- Ester (2): Moderate para directing
- Chloro (3): Moderate para directing
- Methyl (1): Strong para directing
- Ethyl (5): Strong para directing

4) Ordering by Increasing Para-Isomer Yield:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

This matches answer choice B.
