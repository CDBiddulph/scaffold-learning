2025-08-18 11:31:30,462 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the definition of an equilibrium constant (K):
   K = [Products] / [Reactants]
   In this case, K = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA2-]

2) We know the total Ca-EDTA complex concentration is 0.02 M, and the stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5x10^10.

3) Let x = [Ca2+] = free calcium ion concentration
   Then: [Ca-EDTA2-] = 0.02 - x
   [EDTA4-] = x

4) Substituting into the equilibrium constant equation:
   5x10^10 = x * x / (0.02 - x)

5) Rearranging:
   5x10^10(0.02 - x) = x^2

6) This is a complex quadratic equation, but given the large K value, x will be very small.

7) Solving (which requires careful calculation), x ≈ 6.3x10^-7 M

8) This represents the free Ca2+ concentration.

9) Looking at the answer choices, this corresponds to option B.

Answer: B

The key steps were setting up the equilibrium constant equation, recognizing the relationship between complex and free ion concentrations, and carefully solving the resulting equation.
