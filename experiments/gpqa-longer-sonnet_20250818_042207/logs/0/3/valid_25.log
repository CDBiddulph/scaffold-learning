=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:31:49,623 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know the wave function is:
- Time independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Has zero imaginary part

2) We're told that the probability of finding the particle in two different shells is equal (P):
- First shell: between d1 and 2d1
- Second shell: between 2d1 and 3d1

3) To determine probability in a spherical shell, we need to multiply:
- Wave function amplitude squared
- Shell volume

4) Shell volume is proportional to r^2 * width of shell

5) Let's check each candidate wave function ψ(r):

A) ψ(r) = 1/r
   Probability ∝ (1/r)^2 * r^2 = 1
   This means equal probability in different shells!

B) ψ(r) = r^2
   Probability ∝ (r^2)^2 * r^2 = r^4 
   This increases dramatically with radius

C) ψ(r) = 1/r^2
   Probability ∝ (1/r^2)^2 * r^2 = 1/r^2
   This decreases with radius

D) ψ(r) = r
   Probability ∝ r^2 * r^2 = r^4
   Similar problem to option B

6) Option A satisfies all conditions.
