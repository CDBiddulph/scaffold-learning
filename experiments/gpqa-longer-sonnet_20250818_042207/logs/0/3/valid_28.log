Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin are correct terms in the described pathway

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:43,215 [INFO] Answer choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-18 11:31:49,668 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the Wnt3a signaling pathway details from the passage:
- Wnt3a is a secreted glycoprotein ligand
- It binds to the frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor
- Upon binding, Beta-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm
- Beta-catenin then translocates to the nucleus
- In the nucleus, Beta-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator
- Without ligand binding, Beta-catenin is degraded by a destruction complex

2. Let's evaluate each answer choice for scientific accuracy:

A) Contains correct terms:
- "Translocation into nucleus" ✓
- "Intracellular calcium" ✓
- "Destruction complex" ✓
- "Frizzled" ✓

B) Contains correct terms:
- "Proteasomal degradation" ✓
- "N-terminal extracellular" ✓
- "Frizzled" ✓
- "Non-canonical" ✓

C) Contains correct terms:
- "Beta-catenin" ✓
- "Directly binds DNA" ✓
- "LRP5/6" ✓
- "Transmembrane receptor protein" ✓

D) Contains correct terms:
- "Transcriptional co-activator" ✓
- "Glycoprotein" ✓
- "Accumulation in cytoplasm" ✓
- "Beta-catenin" ✓

3. All choices seem to contain correct scientific terms. However, the question asks for a group with ONLY correct terms.

4. After careful review, Choice C contains ALL scientifically accurate terms with respect to the Wnt3a signaling pathway description.
