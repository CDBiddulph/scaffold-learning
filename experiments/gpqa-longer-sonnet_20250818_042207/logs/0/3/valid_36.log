=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:58,167 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the context:
- The localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Consider the arc minute scales:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests observations of distant objects, not nearby objects

3. Evaluate the distances in each option:
A) 1 million and 1 billion light years
- These are extremely large, extragalactic distances
- Consistent with high-precision astronomical surveys
- Scale matches the large localization precision

B) 1 thousand to 100 thousand light years
- These are galactic distances
- Possible, but somewhat smaller than the implied scale

C) 10 to 100 light years
- These are very local, solar neighborhood distances
- Too close to match the broad localization precision

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
- These are extremely close, solar system scale distances
- Far too small to match the observational context

4. Conclusion:
Option A represents the most plausible set of distances for these astronomical observations.
