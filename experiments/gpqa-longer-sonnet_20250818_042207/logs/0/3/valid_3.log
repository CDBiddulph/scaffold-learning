2025-08-18 11:31:30,676 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density Definition:
• Density = Mass ÷ Volume
• For a sphere, density depends on both total mass and radius

2. Option A: Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
• Same mass and volume as Earth
• Will have the same density as Earth (≈ 5.5 g/cm³)

3. Option B: 2 Earth masses and 5.5 g/cm³
• Given a specific density
• Not derived from compositional principles

4. Option C: Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive
• If mass increases 5x, volume will increase proportionally
• Planet will maintain the same density as Earth
• Scaling up a planet homogeneously preserves density

5. Option D: Same composition as Earth, half the mass
• Reduced mass means reduced volume
• Density would remain constant at 5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparative Analysis:
• Options A, C, and D have the same density of Earth (5.5 g/cm³)
• Option B has a specified density of 5.5 g/cm³

7. Conclusion:
• All options have equivalent density
• Technically, any could be correct

8. Strictly interpreting the question, I'll choose the most generically representative option.
