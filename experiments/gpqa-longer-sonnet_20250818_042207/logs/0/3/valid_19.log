=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-18 11:31:40,184 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the equilibrium temperature equation for planets:
   T_eq = T_star * ((1 - A)/(4 * R/a))^(1/4)
   Where A is albedo, R is stellar radius, a is orbital distance

2) Given info:
   - Albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets
   - T1/T2 ≈ 1.4
   - T2/T3 ≈ 2.3
   - M1/M2 ≈ 1.15
   - M2/M3 ≈ 1.35

3) Equilibrium temperature is proportional to (a/R)^(-1/4)

4) The masses suggest a relationship between orbital distances

5) Applying Kepler's Third Law: P^2 ∝ a^3
   So the orbital period ratio will relate to the orbital distance

6) Combining the temperature and mass ratios suggests the orbital period of Planet3 is significantly larger than Planet1

7) Comparing the ratios and doing the math, the orbital period of Planet3 appears to be about 10.4 times larger than Planet1

8) This matches answer choice D.

Therefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 10.4 times larger than that of Planet1.
