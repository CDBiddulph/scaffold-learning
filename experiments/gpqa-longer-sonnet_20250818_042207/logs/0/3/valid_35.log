=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH in single cells
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:31:58,335 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Evidence:
- Hi-C showed a significant interaction signal between a promoter and enhancer
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. Analyzing Hi-C Characteristics:
- Hi-C is a genome-wide method that captures chromatin interactions
- It uses population-level data (50M cells)
- Can detect interactions that might not be visible in individual cells

3. Analyzing FISH Limitations:
- FISH looks at interactions in individual cells
- Less sensitive to low-frequency interactions
- Requires a certain interaction frequency to be detectable

4. Key Observations:
- The interaction signal is statistically significant in Hi-C
- The 20% expression reduction suggests a real functional interaction
- The interaction spans ~1 Mb linear distance

5. Reasoning:
- The interaction likely exists but may be too rare or transient to consistently detect in single cells
- The dCas9-KRAB effect confirms a functional interaction
- This suggests a low-frequency interaction not easily captured by FISH

6. Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH in single cells.
