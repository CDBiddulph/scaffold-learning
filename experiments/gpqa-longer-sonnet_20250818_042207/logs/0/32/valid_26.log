=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K is the order of magnitude of the black hole entropy
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-18 11:55:11,785 [INFO] LLM Response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for the angular size θ of an object:
   θ = (2R/d) in radians
   where R is the radius of the object and d is its distance

2) The radius o...
