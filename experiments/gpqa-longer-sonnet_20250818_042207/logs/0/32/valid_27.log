=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25 is the expectation value of S_y

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value of spin:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) Here, ψ = (3i, 4)

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) Let's compute σ_y * ψ first:
   ...
