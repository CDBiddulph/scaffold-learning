=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory

1. Understanding the Problem:
- We have a light beam propagating through a moving glass medium
- The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
- We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer
- Speed of light in vacuum is given as c = 1

2. Applying Relativistic Velocity Transformation:
- This is a scenario involving relative motion and light propagation
- We need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula
- The formula for relative velocity is: (u + v) / (1 + uv/cÂ²)
- Here, u is the speed of light in the glass, v is the glass velocity

3. Substituting Known Values:
- Speed of light in glass = 1/n
- Glass velocity = v
- Applying relativistic velocity addition formula:
  [(1/n) + v] / [1 + ((1/n)v)/1]
  = [(1/n) + v] / [1 + v/n]

4. Simplifying the Expression:
- This reduces to: (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

5. Comparing with Answer Choices:
- This matches option D exactly

Answer: D

The reasoning involves relativistic velocity transformation, taking into account the motion of the medium and the speed of light within it.
