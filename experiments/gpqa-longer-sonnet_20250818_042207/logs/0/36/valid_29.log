Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 % EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43 corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon

2025-08-18 11:58:26,375 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Identifying key requirements:
- We need an optically active saturated hydrocarbon
- Optically active means the molecule must have a chiral center
- This requires a molecule with an asymmetric carbon

2. Analyzing molecular formulas:
- For each composition, I'll calculate the molecular formula
- I'll check if the formula allows for a chiral center

3. Calculations:
A) C 83.33%, H 16.66%
- Molecular weight ratio suggests C6H12
- This is cyclohexane - symmetrical, NOT optically active

B) C 83.72%, H 16.27%
- Molecular weight ratio suggests C7H14
- Possible structures include 2-methylhexane or 3-methylhexane
- These have chiral centers! âœ“

C) C 82.75%, H 17.25%
- Molecular weight ratio suggests C5H10
- Cyclopentane - symmetrical, NOT optically active

D) C 84%, H 16%
- Molecular weight ratio suggests C8H16
- Possible, but structure not clear enough to confirm chirality

4. Conclusion:
Option B is the only data set corresponding to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
