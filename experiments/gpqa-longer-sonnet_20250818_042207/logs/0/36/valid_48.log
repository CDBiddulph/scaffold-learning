=== INPUT ===
In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators to achieve regular branching in a polymer made only from ethylene
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Problem Analysis:
- The key task is creating a branched polyethylene using only ethylene and a dual catalyst system
- The goal is to achieve regular branching in the polymer backbone

2. Scientific Context:
- Polyethylene branching typically requires special catalytic conditions
- Metallocene catalysts are known for controlling polymer microstructure
- Group VIa transition metals include chromium, molybdenum, tungsten
- Noble metal catalysts are often expensive for large-scale polymer production

3. Evaluating Each Statement:
A) Implementation claim - Partially true, some advanced polyethylene manufacturing techniques exist
B) Aluminum activator limitation - Requires verification
C) Group VIa metal catalyst claim - Most precise and scientifically credible statement
D) Noble metal catalyst cost claim - Technically true but not most relevant to the core question

4. Detailed Reasoning for C:
- Group VIa transition metals can create specialized coordination sites
- Specific activators can control polymerization mechanisms
- This approach allows precise control of polymer branching
- The statement is technically and scientifically most accurate

5. Elimination Process:
- A: Too broad and not specific enough
- B: Not conclusively proven
- C: Most precise scientific explanation
- D: While true, not directly answering the polymerization mechanism

Answer: C
