=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH in single cells
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:36,231 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the key details:
- Hi-C analysis suggests a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- The interaction spans ~1 Mb linear distance
- FISH could not validate this interaction
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

2. Analyzing the potential reasons for inconsistency:

A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH detection
- Hi-C uses population-level data (50M cells)
- FISH looks at individual cells
- If interaction is rare or transient, it might be missed in single-cell FISH
- The functional validation via dCas9-KRAB suggests a real interaction exists

B) Structural variation affecting linear distance
- Genomic structural variations can alter expected linear distances
- This could create discrepancies between predicted and actual interaction

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH
- 1 Mb is typically within FISH detection range
- This seems unlikely as a primary explanation

D) False-positive Hi-C signal
- While possible, the functional validation (expression reduction) suggests a genuine interaction

3. Conclusion reasoning:
- The dCas9-KRAB experiment provides functional evidence of interaction
- Population vs single-cell detection differences are most likely explanation
