=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers in the PFA-only IKAROS ChIP-seq dataset

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Understanding the scenario:
- ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing) was performed
- IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells
- Two fixation methods compared: PFA-only vs PFA+DSG
- Peaks seen in PFA-only disappear with PFA+DSG fixation

2. Biological context:
- Transcription factors bind dynamically to chromatin
- Different crosslinking methods can reveal different binding characteristics
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) vs PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) have different crosslinking properties

3. Peak location considerations:
- Disappearing peaks suggest transient or weak interactions
- Likely represent dynamic protein-DNA interactions
- Most likely to occur at regulatory regions with frequent protein turnover

4. Analyzing answer choices:
- Random locations (A) would not show systematic disappearance
- Repeats (B) are typically less dynamically regulated
- Introns (C) are generally less transcription factor binding sites
- Active promoters/enhancers (D) are regions of high transcription factor dynamics

5. Reasoning:
- Active promoters/enhancers have rapid protein binding/unbinding
- Different crosslinking methods would most sensitively reveal these transient interactions
