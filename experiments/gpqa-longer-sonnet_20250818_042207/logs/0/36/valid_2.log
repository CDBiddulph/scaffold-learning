=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 % — two spots were seen on the TLC, and the isolated 4 g product corresponds to a 66.66% yield
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. TLC Analysis:
- The students observed spots under UV light
- They identified the presence of:
   a) Starting material
   b) Product
   c) Solvent
- This means A = three spots were seen on the TLC plate

2. Product and Starting Material Recovery:
- Product isolated: 4 g
- Starting material recovered: 3 g

3. Yield Calculation:
- Let's calculate the theoretical yield
- The question indicates 10 g of benzoic acid was initially used
- Product recovered: 4 g
- Percentage Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) × 100%
- Percentage Yield = (4 g / 10 g) × 100%
- Percentage Yield = 0.4 × 100% = 40%

4. Checking the Options:
- A = three, Yield = 44.44% is closest to our calculation
- This corresponds to option C

5. Final Verification:
- Option C matches both the number of TLC spots (A = three)
- And the calculated yield is very close to the reported 44.44%

Answer: C
