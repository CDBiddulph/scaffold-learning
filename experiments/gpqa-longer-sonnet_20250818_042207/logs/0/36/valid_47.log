=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D) No, there is no difference for multi-Higgs-doublet models

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:45,248 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Question:
- The question concerns multi-Higgs-doublet models
- Specifically asking about Breit-Weigner corrections to Oblique Parameters
- Want to know if these corrections improve constraints on New Physics

2. Theoretical Background:
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) are sensitive to quantum corrections in electroweak theory
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models introduce additional scalar fields
- Breit-Wigner corrections can modify quantum loop corrections

3. Theoretical Analysis:
- In multi-Higgs-doublet models, additional charged scalars can modify electroweak precision measurements
- Breit-Wigner corrections typically provide more refined quantum corrections
- The impact depends on the specific mass spectrum of charged scalars

4. Systematic Evaluation of Options:
- Option A: Suggests original parameters are better (seems unlikely)
- Option B: Claims a significant difference (requires strong evidence)
- Option C: Suggests mass-dependent effect (most nuanced interpretation)
- Option D: Claims no difference (seems overly simplistic)

5. Conclusion:
The mass dependence and quantum correction details suggest that the impact varies, making Option C the most scientifically precise answer.
