=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:26,339 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. To determine how many particles reach the ground, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5 seconds.

2. Distance traveled = speed × time
   Relativistic effects will be considered due to high speeds (close to speed of light)

3. Let's calculate distance for each particle:
   • Zeta: 0.96c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,880m
   • Eta: 0.9c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,700m
   • Chi: 0.88c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,640m
   • Lambda: 0.93c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2,790m

4. Compare distances to ground level (13,000m):
   • Zeta: 2,880m short of ground
   • Eta: 2,700m short of ground
   • Chi: 2,640m short of ground
   • Lambda: 2,790m short of ground

5. Number of particles reaching ground ranking:
   By comparing distances, ranking is: 
   zeta > lambda > eta > chi

6. This matches option B.
