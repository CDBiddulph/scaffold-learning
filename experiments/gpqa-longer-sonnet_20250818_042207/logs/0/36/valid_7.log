=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle, since the C-NOT here flips the target when the control is \left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 11:58:06,696 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the input state:
   • Input state is \left|\psi\right\rangle = \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left|0\right\rangle
   • First qubit (control qubit) is in superposition
   • Second qubit (target qubit) is \left|0\right\rangle

2. C-NOT gate operation rules:
   • If control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle, target qubit remains unchanged
   • If control qubit is \left|1\right\rangle, target qubit is flipped

3. Analyzing the input:
   • The control qubit has a coefficient of \left|0\right\rangle with amplitude \alpha
   • Therefore, the target qubit will remain \left|0\right\rangle

4. Examining the answer choices:
   • Option A keeps the state exactly the same
   • Option B changes the target qubit to \left|1\right\rangle (incorrect)
   • Option C involves unnecessary flipping (incorrect)
   • Option D also involves incorrect qubit states

5. Conclusion:
   • The C-NOT gate preserves the original state when the control qubit is \left|0\right\rangle
