=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Understanding the Mott-Gurney Equation:
- This equation describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in semiconductor devices
- It assumes specific conditions for its validity

2. Key Requirements for the Equation:
- Single-carrier device (only one type of charge carrier)
- Trap-free semiconductor (no charge trapping)
- Negligible injection barrier
- Negligible diffusion current
- Ohmic contacts preferred

3. Analyzing Each Option:
A) Correct conditions: Ohmic contact, single-carrier, trap-free ✓
B) Correct conditions: No carrier injection barrier, single-carrier, trap-free ✓
C) Incorrect: Schottky contact would introduce an injection barrier
D) Incorrect: Two-carrier device violates single-carrier assumption

4. Detailed Reasoning:
- The Mott-Gurney equation assumes a uniform, trap-free semiconductor
- It requires no significant barrier to carrier injection
- It works best with Ohmic contacts that allow easy charge carrier entry
- The equation describes current flow when charge carriers are space-charge limited

5. Conclusion:
Option B most precisely describes the conditions for Mott-Gurney equation validity.
