=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in bromination of the given benzene derivatives
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:28,230 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Question:
- We need to arrange substances in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer in bromination
- C6H5 represents a benzene ring
- We need to understand the directing effects of substituents

2. Substituent Effects on Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution:
- Substituents can be classified as:
  a) Activating or deactivating
  b) Ortho/Para or Meta directing

3. Analyzing Each Substituent:
1) C6H5-CH3 (methylbenzene/toluene): 
   - Activating group
   - Strong ortho/para director
   - High para-selectivity

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate):
   - Weakly deactivating
   - Meta directing
   - Low para-selectivity

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene):
   - Deactivating group
   - Weak para director
   - Low para-selectivity

4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene):
   - Strong deactivating
   - Meta directing
   - Lowest para-selectivity

5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene):
   - Activating group
   - Strong ortho/para director
   - High para-selectivity

6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid):
   - Deactivating group
   - Meta directing
   - Low para-selectivity

4. Ordering by Increasing Para-Isomer Weight Fraction:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

5. Matching with Answer Choices:
This matches option B.

Answer: B
