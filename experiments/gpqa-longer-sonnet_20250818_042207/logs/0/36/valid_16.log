=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development, causing mosaicism

2025-08-18 11:58:17,540 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the problem:
- A scientist performed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing on a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The resulting animal has different genomic sequences in different cell lineages
- This suggests genetic modification occurred inconsistently during embryo development

2. Key scientific principles:
- CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can create genetic modifications
- During early embryonic development, cells divide and differentiate
- If gene editing occurs at different stages, it can lead to "mosaicism" - where different cells have different genetic sequences

3. Analyzing the options:
A) Converting messenger RNA to cDNA is not a standard mechanism for genome modification
B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation is unlikely
C) Surrogate mother's DNA introduction is extremely improbable
D) Continuous Cas9 protein cutting and donor DNA incorporation during embryo development is the most likely explanation for mosaic genetic changes

4. Reasoning for Option D:
- Cas9 can continue to cut DNA at different stages of embryo development
- If Cas9 cuts DNA and donor DNA is incorporated at different cell division stages, some cells will have the modification while others will not
- This precisely explains the observation of different genomic sequences in different cell lineages
- This phenomenon is known as genetic mosaicism, a well-documented outcome of early-stage gene editing

5. Conclusion:
The most probable cause of different genomic sequences in different cell lineages is the continuous action of Cas9 protein during embryo development, leading to mosaic genetic modifications.
