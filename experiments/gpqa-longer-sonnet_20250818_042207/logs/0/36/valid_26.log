1. Understanding the problem:
- We have a supermassive black hole at a distance of 10^10 parsecs
- Its angular size is 10^-17 degrees
- We need to find the order of magnitude of its entropy

2. Black hole entropy calculation:
- Black hole entropy is typically proportional to the area of its event horizon
- The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = kA/4l^2
  (where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is event horizon area, l is Planck length)

3. Calculating event horizon radius:
- Angular size θ = radius/distance
- Radius = θ * distance
- Radius = 10^-17 * 10^10 parsecs
- 1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
- Radius ≈ 10^-7 meters

4. Entropy calculation:
- Area ∝ (radius)^2
- Area ∝ (10^-7)^2 = 10^-14 m^2
- Entropy ∝ 10^-14 m^2
- Entropy ∝ 10^62 J/K

5. Comparing with answer choices, the closest is option C.
