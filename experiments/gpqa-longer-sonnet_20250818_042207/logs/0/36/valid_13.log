1. Understanding the Question:
- SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory
- We need to identify which symmetries must be respected by ALL operators in SMEFT

2. Analyzing Each Symmetry:

Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental to all relativistic field theories
- Describes how physics looks the same in different reference frames
- ESSENTIAL in SMEFT
- MUST be respected

Poincaré Symmetry:
- Includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
- Also fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
- ESSENTIAL in SMEFT
- MUST be respected

CP Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations
- Not a fundamental requirement in SMEFT
- Can be violated in some operator constructions
- NOT necessarily respected by all operators

CPT Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T)
- A very fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories
- Likely to be respected, but not absolutely guaranteed in all SMEFT operators

3. Elimination Process:
- Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are definitely required
- CP symmetry is NOT required
- CPT symmetry is likely but not absolutely guaranteed

4. Conclusion:
The symmetries that MUST be respected are Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries.
