=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG are the forward and reverse primers
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:44,700 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the requirements:
- Need to clone the sequence into the expression vector
- Requires directional cloning
- Want to use unique restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS)
- Primers must include restriction enzyme recognition sequences

2. Analyze the MCS:
- Available sites: SmaI, HindIII, BglII, KpnI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI
- We have enzymes: ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, ScaI

3. Choose restriction sites:
- HindIII is in the MCS
- KpnI is also in the MCS
- These sites will allow directional cloning

4. Analyze primer options:
- Forward primer needs HindIII site
- Reverse primer needs KpnI site
- Both must include the start/stop of the sequence

5. Evaluate each option:
A) Uses HindIII/KpnI - Correct sites ✓
B) Uses HindIII/BamHI - Incorrect ✗
C) Uses SmaI/BamHI - Incorrect ✗
D) Uses BamHI/HindIII - Incorrect orientation ✗
