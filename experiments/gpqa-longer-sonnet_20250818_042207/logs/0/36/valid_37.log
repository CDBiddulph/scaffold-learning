=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A) 1/137 is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Understanding the problem:
- We have two point particles
- Distance between particles is 137 meters
- The scenario involves both an attractive and repulsive force
- We need to find the ratio of repulsive to attractive force strengths

2. Physical principles to consider:
- This sounds like a reference to fundamental physical constants
- The number 137 is very significant in physics - it's the fine structure constant (Î±)
- Fine structure constant is approximately 1/137 and relates electromagnetic interactions

3. Analyzing force interactions:
- Fine structure constant characterizes electromagnetic coupling strength
- It appears in quantum electrodynamics as a dimensionless parameter
- The ratio of forces would likely relate to this fundamental constant

4. Reasoning through the choices:
- Choice A suggests the ratio is 1/137
- This matches the known value of the fine structure constant
- Other choices (137^2, 1/137^2, 137) seem less physically meaningful

5. Verification:
- 1/137 is dimensionless, consistent with a force ratio
- It represents a fundamental quantum electrodynamic relationship
- No complex calculations required beyond recognizing the significance of 137
