What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

1. Understanding the problem:
- We have a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex
- We need to find the free Ca2+ concentration
- Temperature is 25°C
- KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10

2. Using the equilibrium constant expression:
- For the equilibrium: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4-
- Kf = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA]
- Kf = 5x10^10

3. Let x = free Ca2+ concentration
- Initial [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M
- At equilibrium: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x
- [Ca2+] = x
- [EDTA4-] = x

4. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:
- 5x10^10 = x2 / (0.02 - x)

5. Solving for x:
- Assuming x is small compared to 0.02
- 5x10^10 ≈ x2 / 0.02
- x = √(5x10^10 * 0.02)
- x ≈ 6.3x10^-7 M

6. Checking the options, this matches option B.
