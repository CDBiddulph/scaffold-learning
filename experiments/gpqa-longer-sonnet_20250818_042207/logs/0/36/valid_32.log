=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A) -0.34 V is the resulting redox potential of the solution
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

1. Understanding the Problem:
- We have a solution with Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions
- Concentrations: [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M, [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
- pH = 1.0
- Added phosphate concentration = 0.1 M
- E0 for Fe(III)/Fe(II) = 0.77 V
- Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex formation constant = 10^21
- Equilibrium [H2PO4^-] = 6.97×10^-3 M

2. Nernst Equation Considerations:
The Nernst equation relates redox potential to ion concentrations:
E = E0 - (RT/nF)ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

3. Complex Formation Impact:
- Phosphate will form complexes with Fe(III)
- This will reduce free Fe(III) concentration
- Reduced Fe(III) will shift redox potential

4. Detailed Calculation:
- Complex formation constant suggests significant Fe(III)-phosphate complex formation
- This reduces effective [Fe(III)]
- Likely to lower redox potential from standard 0.77 V

5. Estimating Potential:
- Complexation will reduce Fe(III) concentration
- This will shift potential towards more negative values
- The magnitude suggests around +0.26 V to +0.52 V range

6. Elimination Process:
- A (-0.34 V) seems too negative
- B (+0.52 V) is possible
- C (+0.26 V) matches expected reduction
- D (+0.40 V) is intermediate

Considering the systematic analysis, the complexation effects and the given information point towards option C.
