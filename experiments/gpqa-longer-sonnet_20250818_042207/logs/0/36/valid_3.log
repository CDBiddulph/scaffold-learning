2025-08-18 11:58:06,901 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the question:
- We need to determine which exoplanet has the highest density
- Density is defined as mass divided by volume
- Density depends on both mass and size/volume

2. Scientific principles:
- For planets with the same composition, density is constant
- Increasing mass while maintaining same composition means larger radius
- As mass increases, volume increases, but not proportionally

3. Analysis of each option:
a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet: Standard Earth density (5.5 g/cm³)
b) 2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³: This suggests a slightly larger planet
c) 5 times Earth's mass, same composition: This implies a larger radius
d) Half Earth's mass, same composition: This implies a smaller radius

4. Detailed reasoning:
- Option c) would have the same density as Earth (5.5 g/cm³)
- But its larger mass means greater gravitational compression
- This would result in a higher effective density
- Gravitational compression would make the planet more compact

5. Conclusion:
The planet with 5 times Earth's mass would have the highest density due to gravitational compression.
