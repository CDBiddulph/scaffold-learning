2025-08-18 11:58:27,996 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the task:
- We need to determine which stellar system will appear brightest when observed from Earth
- Brightness is related to apparent magnitude, which depends on absolute magnitude and distance

2. Key formulas and principles:
- Apparent magnitude relates to absolute magnitude and distance via: m = M + 5 log(d/10)
- For multiple star systems, total brightness is calculated by adding their individual flux values

3. Analyzing each option:

a) V = 7 mag at 50 parsecs
   - Likely dimmer due to large distance

b) V = 7 mag at 20 parsecs
   - Brighter than (a) due to closer distance

c) Two stars at 5 parsecs: V1 = 7, V2 = 8
   - Calculate total apparent magnitude
   - These will appear very bright due to close distance

d) Absolute magnitude of 7 at 10 parsecs
   - By definition, this would have an apparent magnitude of 7

e) Two stars at 10 parsecs: M1 = 7, M2 = 8
   - Will have specific apparent magnitudes based on distance

f) Two stars at 10 parsecs: M1 = 7, M2 = 7
   - Both identical absolute magnitudes

4. Comparing brightness:
- Option (c) will be brightest due to:
  - Closest distance (5 parsecs)
  - Combined flux from two stars

5. Verification calculation:
- (c) has two stars at close distance
- Total flux will be greater than single star systems
- Magnitude difference of 1 between stars means significant combined brightness
