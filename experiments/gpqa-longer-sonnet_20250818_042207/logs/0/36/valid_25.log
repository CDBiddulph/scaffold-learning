=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A) 1/r yields equal probability P in the shells between d1–2d1 and 2d1–3d1
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 11:58:26,654 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key Information:
- Particle is between two concentric spheres
- Outer sphere radius is 100 times inner sphere radius
- Wave function is:
  * Time independent
  * Spherically symmetric
  * Imaginary part is zero

2. Probability Analysis:
- Probability P is the same in two shells:
  * Shell 1: between d1 and 2d1
  * Shell 2: between 2d1 and 3d1

3. Probability Distribution Reasoning:
- For this to be true, the wave function must vary in a specific way with radius
- The probability in a spherical shell depends on:
  * Volume of the shell
  * Wave function magnitude squared

4. Mathematical Analysis:
- Volume of a shell ∝ r²
- Probability density ∝ (wave function)²
- If wave function ∝ 1/r, then (wave function)² ∝ 1/r²
- This ensures constant probability across equal volume shells

5. Verification:
- 1/r² ensures equal probability in shells with equal volume
- Satisfies the conditions in the problem statement

6. Final Check Against Options

Answer: C

The key insight is that 1/r² provides a constant probability density across equal volume shells, which matches the problem's requirements.
