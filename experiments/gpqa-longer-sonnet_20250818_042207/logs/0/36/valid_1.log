=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:06,479 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the problem:
- We have 10^17 Caesium-137 atoms
- Time period is 80 minutes
- Detector is 2x3 cm, placed 4 meters away

2. Radioactive decay calculation:
- Caesium-137 half-life is approximately 30 years
- Decay constant Î» = ln(2) / half-life
- In 80 minutes, most atoms will remain intact

3. Gamma-ray emission rate:
- Each Caesium-137 decay typically emits 1 gamma ray
- Average decay rate will depend on half-life
- Roughly estimate: ~10^14 gamma rays emitted in 80 minutes

4. Detector considerations:
- 2x3 cm detector at 4 meters
- Solid angle calculation reduces detected gamma rays
- Estimate: detector captures ~1/1000 of total emissions

5. Calculation:
- Total gamma rays: ~10^14
- Detector capture fraction: ~1/1000
- Detected gamma rays: ~10^11 * (1/1000) = 10^8

6. Comparing to answer choices:
- This corresponds to option B: 100 million (10^8)
