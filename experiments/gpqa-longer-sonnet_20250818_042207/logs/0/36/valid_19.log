=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C) ~ 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1
D) ~ 10.4

1. Understanding the problem:
- We have three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3
- The equilibrium temperature ratio is:
  * Planet1:Planet2 = 1.4
  * Planet2:Planet3 = 2.3
- Mass ratio is:
  * Planet1:Planet2 = 1.15
  * Planet2:Planet3 = 1.35
- Albedo is 0.3 for all planets
- We need to find the orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1

2. Recall the key relationships:
- Equilibrium temperature depends on distance from star and star's luminosity
- Orbital period depends on orbital radius

3. Use the temperature ratio to estimate orbital distances:
- Temperature ∝ 1/√(orbital radius)
- (T1/T2)² = (r2/r1)

4. Calculate orbital radius ratios:
- For Planet1:Planet2: (1.4)² = r2/r1
- r2/r1 = 1.96
- For Planet2:Planet3: (2.3)² = r3/r2
- r3/r2 = 5.29

5. Orbital period relationship:
- Orbital period ∝ √(orbital radius³)
- So the orbital period ratio will be the cube root of the radius ratio

6. Calculate orbital period ratio:
- (r3/r1) = (r3/r2) * (r2/r1)
- = 5.29 * 1.96
- = 10.37

7. Cross-check with the given options:
- This closely matches option D, which is ~10.4
