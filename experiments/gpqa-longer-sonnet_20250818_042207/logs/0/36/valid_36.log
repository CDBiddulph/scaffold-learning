=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years from the Sun
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:35,764 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Context:
- Satellites in low Earth orbit are detecting astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of these objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Analyzing the Localization Precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular measurement
- This suggests these objects are relatively distant
- Precision implies these are not nearby, local objects

3. Evaluating Distance Scales:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years 
   - These are extragalactic scales
   - Consistent with uniform (isotropic) distribution
   - Match the precision and scale of observation

B) 1-100 thousand light years
   - This is within our galaxy's scale
   - Possible, but less likely given the precision

C) 10-100 light years
   - Too local, too small a scale
   - Would not match the described observation method

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - Far too close, within our solar system
   - Inconsistent with satellite observations of astronomical objects

4. Conclusion:
Option A best matches the description of the astronomical observation scenario.
