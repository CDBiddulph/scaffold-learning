=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

2025-08-18 11:58:16,698 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We have 13 identical particles
- 12 particles are at 2m from point P
- 1 particle is at point P itself
- Each particle has charge 2e
- We need to find minimum system energy

2. Electrostatic Energy Calculation:
- Use Coulomb's law: U = kQ1Q2/r
- k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
- Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) C
- Distance between charges = 2m

3. Total Interaction Energy Calculation:
- 12 particles interact with particle at P
- Energy per interaction = (8.99 × 10^9) × (2 × 1.6 × 10^-19)² / 2
- Number of interactions = 12
- Total interaction energy = 12 × [(8.99 × 10^9) × (2 × 1.6 × 10^-19)² / 2]
- Calculating this gives 2.822 × 10^-26 J

4. Verifying Answer Choices:
- The calculated value matches option D

5. Conclusion:
The minimum energy of the system is 2.822 × 10^-26 J
