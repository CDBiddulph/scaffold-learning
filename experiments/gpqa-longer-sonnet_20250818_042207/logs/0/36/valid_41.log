1. Question Analysis:
- We have a textile dye with extensively conjugated π-electrons
- The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV
- We need to determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound

2. Color and Energy Relationship:
- Light color is determined by its energy/wavelength
- Energy of light (E) = hc/λ, where h = Planck's constant, c = speed of light, λ = wavelength
- Complementary colors are opposite on the color wheel

3. Energy Calculation:
- Energy given is 2.3393 eV
- This suggests the absorbed light falls in the visible spectrum
- Blue and violet have higher energies (~2.5-3.0 eV)
- Red has lower energy (~1.8-2.2 eV)

4. Reasoning:
- Since the emitted light's energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed light will have a complementary color
- 2.3393 eV corresponds to red light's energy range

5. Option Elimination:
- A) Blue - Too high energy
- B) Violet - Too high energy
- C) Red - Matches the calculated energy
- D) Yellow - Different energy range
