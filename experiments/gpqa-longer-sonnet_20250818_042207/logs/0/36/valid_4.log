=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:06,912 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the principles of radioactive decay and conditional probability.

1. Understanding the Problem:
- Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
- 50 minutes have already passed without decay
- We want to calculate decay probability for the next 150 minutes

2. Radioactive Decay Probability:
- This suggests an exponential decay model
- Let's calculate the probability of decay after 200 minutes (50 + 150)
- We need to use conditional probability principles

3. Probability Calculation:
- P(decay in 200 min) = 1 - P(no decay in 200 min)
- P(no decay in 200 min) = P(no decay in first 100 min) * P(no decay in next 100 min)
- P(no decay in first 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
- After 50 min without decay, remaining probability is 0.68 / 0.32 = 0.68 * (1/0.32)
- P(decay in next 150 min) = 1 - (0.68 * (1/0.32)) = 0.52 or 52%

4. Checking Options:
- 52% matches option C

5. Verification:
- The result accounts for the condition of no decay so far
- Uses probabilistic reasoning for radioactive decay
