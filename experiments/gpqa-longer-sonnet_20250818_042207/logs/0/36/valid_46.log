2025-08-18 11:58:45,639 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using the principles of stellar physics and the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

1. Key Information:
- Star A peak photon energy: 7.21 eV
- Sun's peak photon energy: 1.41 eV
- Star A is 24 times as luminous as the sun

2. Stefan-Boltzmann Law Relationships:
L ∝ R²T⁴
Where L = Luminosity, R = Radius, T = Surface Temperature

3. Temperature Determination:
Peak energy is proportional to temperature
T ∝ Peak Energy

4. Calculate Temperature Ratio:
T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

5. Luminosity Relationship:
24 = (R(Star A) / R(Sun))² * (5.11)⁴

6. Solve for Radius:
R(Star A) / R(Sun) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
                    = √(24 / 671.57)
                    = √(0.0357)
                    = 0.189
                    ≈ 0.19

7. Check Answer Choices:
The value 0.19 corresponds to option B.
