=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up because the reaction is equilibrium-limited under the conditions used
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:46,506 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Problem Analysis:
- The student is doing a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrocarbon reaction
- Current conditions: 300°C
- Goal: Increase reactant conversion without losing selectivity
- Previous attempts with catalyst modification did not change reactor exit composition

2. Scientific Reasoning:
- If changing catalyst composition didn't help, the reaction is likely equilibrium-limited
- In equilibrium-limited reactions, conversion depends on thermodynamic conditions
- Temperature and pressure are key variables affecting chemical equilibrium

3. Thermodynamic Considerations:
- Lowering temperature typically shifts equilibrium towards product formation
- Increasing catalyst amount can help overcome kinetic limitations
- However, potential side reactions like polymerization must be considered

4. Analyzing Answer Choices:
A) Incorrect - premature surrender without exploring options
B) Partially correct - suggests temperature reduction and catalyst increase
C) Best option - considers temperature reduction, catalyst increase, AND potential polymerization risk
D) Incorrect - increasing temperature would likely reduce conversion and potentially cause unwanted polymerization

5. Rationale for Choice C:
- Decreasing temperature can improve conversion by shifting equilibrium
- Increasing catalyst amount can enhance reaction kinetics
- Acknowledging polymerization risk shows careful scientific approach

Answer: C
