=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D) 3 loops

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:16,666 [INFO] LLM response: Let me solve this systematically:

1. Question Analysis:
- We're asked to determine the number of loops in a Feynman diagram
- Given a symbolic expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2
- Key goal: Count number of loops

2. Feynman Diagram Loop Counting Principle:
- The number of loops in a Feynman diagram is directly related to the power of the loop integration measure
- Loop count typically manifests in the dimensionality of loop integrals
- Dimensionality correlates with the number of internal loop momenta

3. Symbolic Expression Analysis:
- 1/(4pi)^6 suggests a high-order integration
- The exponent 6 implies multiple loop integrations
- Most likely indicates 3 independent loop momentum integrations

4. Systematic Elimination:
- A) 6 loops: Too high, doesn't match (4pi)^6 scaling
- B) 2 loops: Inconsistent with symbolic complexity
- C) 1 loop: Not matching the integration measure
- D) 3 loops: Matches the (4pi)^6 scaling perfectly

5. Conclusion:
The symbolic expression's structure strongly suggests 3 loops.
