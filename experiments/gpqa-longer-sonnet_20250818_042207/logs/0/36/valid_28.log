=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D) Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin are correct terms in the described pathway

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:58:27,335 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the question:
- I need to identify the group of terms that are ALL correctly used in the Wnt3a signaling pathway description.

2. Key components of the Wnt3a pathway from the passage:
- Involves Wnt3a ligand
- Uses frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor
- Beta-catenin is crucial
- Involves translocation of Beta-catenin to nucleus
- Includes destruction complex
- Results in transcriptional regulation

3. Evaluating each option:

A) "Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled"
- Translocation into nucleus ✓
- Intracellular calcium ✓
- Destruction complex ✓
- Frizzled ✓
ALL terms are correct!

B) "Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical"
- Proteasomal (misspelled) degradation ✓
- N-terminal extracellular ✓
- Frizzled ✓
- Non-canonical ✓
ALL terms are correct

C) "Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein"
- Beta-catenin ✓
- Directly binds DNA ✓
- LRP5/6 ✓
- Transmembrane receptor protein ✓
ALL terms are correct

D) "Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin"
- Transcriptional co-activator ✓
- Glycoprotein ✓
- Accumulation in cytoplasm ✓
- Beta-catenin ✓
ALL terms are correct

4. Multiple correct options exist, so I'll choose the most precise one.

5. Option A stands out as the most precise representation of the pathway's key mechanistic terms.
