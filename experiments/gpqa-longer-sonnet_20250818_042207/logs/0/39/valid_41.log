2025-08-18 12:01:07,095 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
   • Energy of light determines its color
   • Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (blue/violet)
   • Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (red/yellow)

2) The dye emits light with ...
