2025-08-18 12:00:30,019 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. For an Earth-like planet, density depends on the total mass and volume.

2. Case a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
• This would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3. Case b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and 5.5 g/cm³
• This could be possible, ...
