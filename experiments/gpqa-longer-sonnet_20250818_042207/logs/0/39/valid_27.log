=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D) -12*hbar/25 is the expectation value of S_y

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:49,209 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the state vector and σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix

2) The state vector is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]

3) The σ_y matrix is:
   σ_y = [0  -i]
         [i   0]

4) Calculate ψ† σ_y ψ:...
