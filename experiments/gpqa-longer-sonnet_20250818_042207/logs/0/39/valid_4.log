=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44% is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:29,756 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the initial probability of decay within 100 minutes:
• This is 32% overall
• We're now 50 minutes into this period

2) We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived 50 minutes.

3) This ...
