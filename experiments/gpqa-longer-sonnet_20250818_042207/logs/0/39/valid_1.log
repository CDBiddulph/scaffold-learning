=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C) 1 million (10^6) gamma-rays detected after 80 minutes
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:31,062 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the half-life of Caesium-137:
• Caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years (which is very long)

2) Calculate the decay constant (λ):
• λ = ln(2) / half-life
• λ ≈ 0.693 / (30 × 365 × 24 × 60 × 60) ≈ 7 × 10^-10 per second

3) Calculate ini...
