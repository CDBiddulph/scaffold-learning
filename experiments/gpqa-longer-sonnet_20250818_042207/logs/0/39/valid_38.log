2025-08-18 12:00:59,159 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the Cope rearrangement:
- It involves a concerted [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement
- It typically occurs at elevated temperatures
- Involves migration of Ï€ systems

2) Analyze the starting molecule:
- It's a bicyclic structure with a vinyl gr...
