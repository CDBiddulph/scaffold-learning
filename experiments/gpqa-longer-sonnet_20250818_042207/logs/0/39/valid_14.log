=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D) 2.822 x 10^-26 J

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:39,697 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know:
• 12 charges are at a distance of 2 m from point P
• The 13th charge is at point P
• Each charge is 2e
• Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

2) Calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges:
• Charge...
