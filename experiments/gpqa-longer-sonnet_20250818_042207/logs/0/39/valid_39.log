=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D) At active promoters and enhancers in the PFA-only IKAROS ChIP-seq dataset

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:59,563 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. First, let's understand what's happening:
- The original ChIP-seq with PFA fixation showed IKAROS binding peaks
- When PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) fixation is used, those peaks disappear

2. This suggests something about the fixation method is changi...
