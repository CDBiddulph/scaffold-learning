2025-08-18 12:00:39,709 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is:
• It's a framework for understanding physics beyond the Standard Model
• It respects fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory

2. Lorentz Symmetry:
• This is a fundamental symmetry...
