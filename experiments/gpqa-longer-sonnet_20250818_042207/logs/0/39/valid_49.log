=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C) triplet for the most deshielded hydrogen in 2
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:01:07,443 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) The starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, which is a ketone.

2) When irradiated with UV light, a photochemical reaction likely occurs. Since the molecular weight remains the same, this suggests a photochemical rearrangement.

3) The most likely photochem...
