=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A) 33.3% mass fraction of HHal acid in the resulting products
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:01:09,608 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) Given information:
   - Volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
   - Densities of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11
   - Volume ratio of A:B = 1:1

2) Let's denote the initial volumes:
   A = x
   B = x
   C = 2.25 (in the original volume ratio)

3) Density ratio suggest...
