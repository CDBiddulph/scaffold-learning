2025-08-18 12:00:30,331 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) Starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O):
• This molecule has 9 carbon atoms
• Looks like a benzene ring with a 3-carbon side chain containing an aldehyde group

2) When treated with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent):
• This adds a methyl group to the al...
