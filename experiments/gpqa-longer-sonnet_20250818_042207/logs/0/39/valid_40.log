=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D) (1+n*v)/(n+v) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:01:07,977 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   If light travels with speed u in a moving medium, and the medium moves with velocity v relative to the observer, the observed speed w is given by:
   w = (u + v) / (1 + u*v)

2) In this case, u is the spe...
