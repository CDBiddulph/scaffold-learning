=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D) 315 for ACAGTGACC

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:58,486 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the given input-output pairs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. We need to find a pattern or rule that connects the input sequence to the output number.

3. Let's count the number of each base in each sequence:
   AGG: A(1), G(2)
   TGCTGA: T(...
