=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta in decreasing order of particles reaching the ground in 1e-5s
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:50,216 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s:
   Distance = Speed × Time

2) Calculate relativistic effects:
   • zeta: v = 0.96c, γ = 1/√(1-0.96²) = 2.50
   • eta: v = 0.9c, γ = 1/√(1-0.9²) = 2.29
   • chi: v = 0.88c, γ = 1/√(1-0.88²...
