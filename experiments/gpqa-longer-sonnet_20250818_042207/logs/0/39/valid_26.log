=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C) 10^62 J/K is the order of magnitude of the black hole entropy
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-18 12:00:49,140 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the angular size formula for a black hole's event horizon:
   θ = 2RS / d
   Where:
   • RS is the Schwarzschild radius
   • d is the distance to the black hole

2) We know:
   • θ = 10^-17 degrees
   • d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Convert degrees to radians...
