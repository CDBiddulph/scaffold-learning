=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 12:01:07,570 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak energy to temperature:
   • Peak energy ∝ Temperature

2) For star A: Peak energy = 7.21 eV
   For sun: Peak energy = 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio will be the peak energies ratio:
   T(Star A) / T(Sun) = 7.21 / 1....
