=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 12:00:30,448 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the equilibrium for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The stability constant (K) is given as 5 × 10¹⁰:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) Total Ca-EDTA concentration is 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of free Ca²⁺

5) ...
