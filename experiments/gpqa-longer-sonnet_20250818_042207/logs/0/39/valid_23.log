=== INPUT ===
Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-18 12:00:50,067 [INFO] LLM response received (first 300 chars): Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the distance modulus formula:
m = M + 5 log(d/10), where:
m = apparent magnitude
M = absolute magnitude
d = distance in parsecs

2) Option a) Apparent magnitude is 7 at 50 parsecs
- This is already an apparent magnitude, so directly 7 mag

3) Option b...
