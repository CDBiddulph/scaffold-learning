=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B) 0.19 times the sun's radius
C) 0.21
D) 0.17

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   T ∝ (Peak Photon Energy)

2) Star A'...
