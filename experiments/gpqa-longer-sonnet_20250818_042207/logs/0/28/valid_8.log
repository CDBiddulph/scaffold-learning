=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B) 6.3x10^-7 M free Ca2+ concentration
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 11:51:29,763 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the equilibrium between the Ca-EDTA complex and free calcium ions:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca2+ + EDTA4-

2) The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is g...
