=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one, the elimination product from 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol indicated by the 1690 cm^-1 IR band
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
