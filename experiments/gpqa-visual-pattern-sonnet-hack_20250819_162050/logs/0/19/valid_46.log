=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16

2025-08-19 23:27:03,251 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:08,302 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   • Peak energy ∝ Temperature

2) Calculate relative temperature:
   • Star A peak: 7.21 eV
   • Sun peak: 1.41 eV
   • Temperature ratio = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

3) Recall Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:
   • Luminosity ∝ (Radius)² × (Temperature)⁴

4) We know star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

5) Let R be star A's radius relative to sun's radius
   24 = R² × (5.11)⁴

6) Solve for R:
   R² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   R² = 24 / 674.24
   R² = 0.036

7) Take square root:
   R = √0.036 = 0.19

8) Check the options: 0.19 corresponds to option B
