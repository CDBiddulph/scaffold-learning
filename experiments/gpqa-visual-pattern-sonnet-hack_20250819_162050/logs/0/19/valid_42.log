=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

■ A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:02,819 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:09,727 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Problem:
- The student is performing a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction
- Current conditions: 300°C
- Goal: Increase reactant conversion without losing selectivity
- Previous attempts with catalyst amount/composition didn't change exit composition

2. Reaction Dynamics Analysis:
- Conversion is typically influenced by:
   a) Temperature
   b) Catalyst amount
   c) Reactor design
   d) Reaction kinetics

3. Temperature Considerations:
- Lower temperature typically:
   - Reduces reaction rate
   - Can increase selectivity
   - Might help overcome mass transfer limitations
- Higher temperature typically:
   - Increases reaction rate
   - Can reduce selectivity
   - Might cause unwanted side reactions or polymerization

4. Catalyst Amount:
- Increasing catalyst amount usually improves conversion
- But student already tried this without success

5. Potential Recommendations:
- Decrease temperature to improve selectivity and potentially reveal mass transfer limitations
- Be cautious of potential polymerization

6. Careful Evaluation of Options:
- Option A: Giving up (inappropriate)
- Option B: Partially good, but missing polymerization risk
- Option C: Best approach - considers temperature reduction and polymerization risk
- Option D: Opposite of recommended approach

7. Conclusion:
The most scientifically sound approach is to decrease temperature while being aware of potential polymerization risks.
