A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
â–  D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-19 23:27:02,062 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:07,855 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what makes a hydrocarbon optically active:
- Optical activity requires a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- This means the carbon must have 4 different substituents
- The molecule must not have a plane of symmetry

2. Analyze the elemental composition:
- All options have roughly the same C:H ratio (around 5:1)
- This suggests similar molecular formulas

3. Mass spectrometry (EI-MS) data reveals fragmentation patterns:
- m/z values represent molecular and fragment ion masses

4. Calculate molecular formulas:
- Option A: C5H12 (pentane)
- Option B: C6H14 (hexane)
- Option C: C4H10 (butane)
- Option D: C7H16 (heptane)

5. Check for chirality:
- Pentane (A): No chiral center
- Hexane (B): No chiral center
- Butane (C): No chiral center
- Heptane (D): Contains a chiral center at the 3rd or 4th carbon

6. Therefore, heptane (Option D) is the only compound with a potential chiral center.
