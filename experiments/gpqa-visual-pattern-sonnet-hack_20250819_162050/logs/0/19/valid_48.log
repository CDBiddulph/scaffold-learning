=== INPUT ===
In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
■ C) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:03,096 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:09,647 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Ethylene Polymerization Background:
- The scientist initially uses a homogeneous organometallic catalyst to generate a high-density polyethylene
- The goal is to introduce regular branches using only ethylene as the reactant

2. Evaluating Statement A (Industrial Implementation):
- Dual catalyst systems for polyethylene modification are indeed used in industry
- Specifically, metallocene catalysts and constrained geometry catalysts enable such modifications
- Statement A appears technically correct

3. Evaluating Statement B (Aluminum Activators):
- Aluminum-based cocatalysts like methylaluminoxane (MAO) are common in polymerization
- The statement claims they don't work for the "essential additional reaction step"
- This seems potentially incorrect, as aluminum-based systems are widely used

4. Evaluating Statement C (Group VIa Transition Metal Catalysts):
- Group VIa includes chromium and molybdenum
- Some transition metals in this group can indeed catalyze polymerization reactions
- The statement seems technically plausible

5. Evaluating Statement D (Noble Metal Catalysts):
- Noble metal catalysts like palladium can polymerize ethylene
- However, they are typically very expensive for large-scale polymer production
- This statement appears technically correct

6. Conclusion:
After careful analysis, Statement A appears to be the most comprehensive and accurate description.
