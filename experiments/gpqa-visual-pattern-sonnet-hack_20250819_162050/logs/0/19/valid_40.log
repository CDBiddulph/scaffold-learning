=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



â–  D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-19 23:27:09,490 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the principles of relative motion and light propagation:
- The speed of light in vacuum is c
- In a stationary medium with index of refraction n, light speed is c/n
- When the medium is moving, we need to apply relativistic velocity addition

2) In classical physics, we would simply add the velocities:
- Medium velocity: v
- Light speed in glass: 1/n
- Resultant speed would be (1/n + v)

3) However, this is incorrect. We need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
- Let u be the speed of light in the moving glass
- We want to find u relative to the observer

4) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
u = (v/n + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)

5) Algebraically simplifying this expression:
u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

6) This matches exactly with option D: (1+n*v)/(n+v)

7) Let's verify the physical interpretation:
- If v = 0 (stationary glass), u = 1/n (light speed in glass)
- The formula accounts for relativistic effects
