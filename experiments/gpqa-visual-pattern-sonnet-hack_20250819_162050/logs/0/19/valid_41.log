2025-08-19 23:27:02,057 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:07,791 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall that energy of light is related to its color/wavelength through the equation E = hν (Planck's equation)

2. We know the emission energy is 2.3393 eV

3. This means the ABSORBED wavelength corresponds to the complementary color

4. The visible spectrum colors and their approximate energies are:
• Violet: ~3.1 eV
• Blue: ~2.8 eV
• Green: ~2.5 eV
• Yellow: ~2.2 eV
• Red: ~1.8 eV

5. The emission energy of 2.3393 eV suggests the absorbed color is close to green/yellow

6. Specifically, this energy is very close to yellow's energy range (around 2.2 eV)

7. Therefore, when this compound absorbs light, it will absorb yellow wavelengths and emit a complementary color (which appears blue/violet)

8. Looking at the options, yellow matches our calculation

Therefore, the compound absorbs yellow light.
