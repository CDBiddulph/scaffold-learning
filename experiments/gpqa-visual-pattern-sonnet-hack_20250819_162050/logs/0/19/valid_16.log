=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

■ D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-19 23:27:01,012 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:06,809 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what's happening:
- The scientist performed genome editing in a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The resulting animal has different genomes in different cell lineages
- This suggests the genetic modification did not occur uniformly during embryo development

2. Analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism:
- The system uses Cas9 protein to cut DNA at a specific location
- Guide RNA directs Cas9 to the target sequence
- Donor DNA can be inserted at the cut site during DNA repair

3. Examining the potential causes:
- Option A: cDNA conversion is not a typical CRISPR mechanism
- Option B: Complex incorporation is unlikely during embryo development
- Option C: Surrogate mother's DNA introduction is implausible
- Option D: Continuous DNA cutting during embryo development could lead to differential genome modification

4. Key insight:
- As the single cell divides and develops into an embryo, Cas9 might continue to be active
- Different cells might experience gene editing at different developmental stages
- This could result in mosaic genome modification

5. Reasoning supports Option D as the most probable explanation.
