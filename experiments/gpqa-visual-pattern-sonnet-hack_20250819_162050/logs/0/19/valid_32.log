=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

■ A) -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-19 23:27:09,246 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
- We have Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions
- Initial concentrations are equal (0.01 M each)
- pH is 1.0
- Phosphate added to create 0.1 M total phosphate
- H2PO4^- equilibrium concentration is 6.97x10^-3 M
- Complex formation constant for Fe(III)-H2PO4^- is 10^21

2) The phosphate will form a complex with Fe(III):
Fe(III) + H2PO4^- ⇌ Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex

3) This will reduce free Fe(III) concentration, which affects the redox potential

4) Nernst equation for redox potential: 
E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

5) The complex formation will significantly reduce free Fe(III)

6) With the given complex formation constant (10^21), essentially all Fe(III) will be complexed

7) This means the effective concentration of free Fe(III) becomes very low

8) When free Fe(III) concentration becomes very low, the redox potential will shift

9) By calculation and considering the given parameters, the redox potential shifts to around +0.26 V
