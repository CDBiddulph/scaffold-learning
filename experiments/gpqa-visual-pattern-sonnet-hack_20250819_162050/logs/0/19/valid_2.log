=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
■ B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:26:59,595 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:04,447 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. TLC Analysis
- The question states the students found A spots under UV light
- This suggests:
   - Starting material spot
   - Product spot
   - Solvent spot
- A = three spots

2. Yield Calculation
- Initial mass of benzoic acid = 10 g
- Mass of product isolated = 4 g
- Mass of starting material recovered = 3 g

3. Percentage Yield Calculation
- Theoretical yield can be calculated by subtracting recovered starting material
- Theoretical yield = 10 g - 3 g = 7 g
- Actual yield = 4 g
- Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%
- Percentage yield = (4 g / 7 g) × 100%
- Percentage yield = 0.5714 × 100%
- Percentage yield = 57.14%

4. Checking the options
- A = three spots ✓
- B (percentage yield) is closest to 55.55%

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

Answer: A
