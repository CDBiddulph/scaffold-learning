=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:06,837 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Caesium-137 (Cs-137) characteristics:
- Half-life: approximately 30 years
- Decays by beta emission and gamma ray emission
- Emits gamma rays with energy around 662 keV

2. Number of atoms calculation:
- Total atoms: 10^17
- Radioactive decay rate (activity) depends on decay constant

3. Decay constant and activity calculation:
- Decay constant λ = ln(2) / half-life
- Activity = λ × number of atoms
- A ≈ 3.8 × 10^9 decays per second

4. Gamma ray emission:
- Each Cs-137 decay produces about 0.85 gamma rays
- Gamma ray emission rate ≈ 3.8 × 10^9 × 0.85 = 3.2 × 10^9 γ rays/second

5. Total γ rays in 80 minutes:
- 80 minutes = 4800 seconds
- Total γ rays = 3.2 × 10^9 × 4800 ≈ 1.5 × 10^13 γ rays

6. Detector considerations:
- Small detector area (2×3 cm²) at 4m distance
- Solid angle and detection efficiency will reduce detected rays

7. Estimated detected γ rays:
- Roughly around 10^6 γ rays

Based on this reasoning, the answer is:
