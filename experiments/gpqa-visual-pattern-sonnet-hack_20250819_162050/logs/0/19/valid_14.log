Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
■ D) 2.822 x 10^-26

2025-08-19 23:27:07,127 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the system:
   - 13 identical charges, each with charge 2e
   - 12 charges are in a circle at 2 m radius from point P
   - 13th charge is at point P itself

2) Calculate the charge value:
   - e = elementary charge = 1.6 × 10^-19 C
   - Each charge = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) Coulomb's law for potential energy:
   - U = kQ1Q2/r
   - k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

4) Energy contribution from the charge at P with 12 surrounding charges:
   - 12 × [k(2e)²/2]
   - 12 × [(8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2]

5) Calculation:
   - 12 × [(8.99 × 10^9) × (10.24 × 10^-38) / 2]
   - 12 × [46.08 × 10^-29]
   - 5.53 × 10^-26 J

6) Checking the options, this is closest to 5.645 × 10^-26 J.
