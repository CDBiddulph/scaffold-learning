=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
â–  D) At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:02,059 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:08,455 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental setup:
- ChIP-seq with PFA fixation
- Antibody targeting IKAROS transcription factor
- Peaks disappear with PFA+DSG (additional crosslinking agent) fixation

2. Significance of fixation method:
- Different fixation methods can alter protein-DNA interactions
- PFA alone allows more flexible protein interactions
- PFA+DSG provides more rigid crosslinking

3. IKAROS characteristics:
- Transcription factor involved in lymphocyte development
- Typically binds regulatory elements
- Known to interact with active chromatin regions

4. Disappearing peaks suggest:
- Transient or weak interactions
- Dynamic protein binding
- Regions with less stable protein-DNA contacts

5. Likely location analysis:
- Random locations (A) - unlikely, suggests specific binding
- Repeats (B) - not characteristic of transcription factor binding
- Introns (C) - possible but less likely for transcription factor binding
- Active promoters/enhancers (D) - high probability due to:
  * Dynamic transcription factor interactions
  * Frequent protein movement
  * Less stable binding configurations
