=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
■ B) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:03,087 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:08,705 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS):
- HindIII is present
- KpnI is present
- BamHI is present

2. Now let's look at the forward and reverse primers:
- The forward primer needs to start with the start codon (ATG)
- The reverse primer needs to include a stop codon and be complementary to the last part of the sequence

3. Checking the given options:
A) Forward primer uses HindIII
   Reverse primer uses KpnI
B) Forward primer uses HindIII
   Reverse primer uses BamHI
C) Forward primer uses SmaI
   Reverse primer uses BamHI
D) Forward primer uses BamHI
   Reverse primer uses HindIII

4. Analyzing the MCS cloning strategies:
- We want a directional cloning approach
- The primers should use unique restriction sites in the MCS
- Ideally, we want sites at opposite ends of the MCS

5. The most suitable combination is option D:
- BamHI is in the middle of the MCS
- HindIII is at the start of the MCS
- This ensures directional cloning
