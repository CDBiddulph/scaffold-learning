=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
■ B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:07,775 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution and the para/ortho directing nature of different groups:

1) Understand the substituent types:
- Electron-donating groups (EDG): CH3, C2H5
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG): NO2, COOH, COOC2H5, Cl

2) Effect of substituents on para/ortho substitution:
- EDG strongly favor para substitution
- Strong EWG inhibit substitution and favor meta substitution

3) Analyze each substance:
1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Strong EDG, very high para yield
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): Moderate EWG, lower para yield
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Weak EWG, moderate para yield
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Strong EWG, very low para yield
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Strong EDG, very high para yield
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): Strong EWG, low para yield

4) Ordering from lowest to highest para yield:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)
