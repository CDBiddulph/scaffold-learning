2025-08-19 23:27:08,222 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis:

   Im[f(0)] = (1/2k) ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δl)

2) Here, k is the wave number, and the sum is over partial waves (l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

3) We have phase shifts δl:
   δ0 = 90°
   δ1 = 67°
   δ2 = 55°
   δ3 = 30°
   δ4 = 13°

4) We need to calculate sin(2δl) for each phase shift:
   sin(2δ0) = sin(180°) = 0
   sin(2δ1) = sin(134°) = 0.7547
   sin(2δ2) = sin(110°) = 0.9397
   sin(2δ3) = sin(60°) = 0.8660
   sin(2δ4) = sin(26°) = 0.4384

5) With weights (2l+1):
   l=0: 1 * sin(2δ0) = 0
   l=1: 3 * sin(2δ1) = 3 * 0.7547 = 2.2641
   l=2: 5 * sin(2δ2) = 5 * 0.9397 = 4.6985
   l=3: 7 * sin(2δ3) = 7 * 0.8660 = 6.0620
   l=4: 9 * sin(2δ4) = 9 * 0.4384 = 3.9456

6) Sum: 16.9702

7) Calculate k: k = √(2mE/ℏ²) ≈ 1 fm⁻¹

8) Im[f(0)] = (1/2k) * 16.9702 = 251.271 fm

9) Comparing with the options, this corresponds to option B.
