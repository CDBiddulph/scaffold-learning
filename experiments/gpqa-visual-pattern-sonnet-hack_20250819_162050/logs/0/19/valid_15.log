=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
■ D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:06,592 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In Feynman diagram calculations, the number of loops directly relates to the power and complexity of the diagram's computational contribution.

2) The key hint is in the power law structure of the expression:
   - alpha^3 suggests a cubic power
   - g^2 suggests a quadratic contribution
   - 1/(4pi)^6 indicates a 6th power scaling

3) In quantum field theory, the number of loops correlates with the power of loop integrals:
   - 1-loop diagrams typically contribute first-order loop corrections
   - 2-loop diagrams usually scale with (1/4π)^4
   - 3-loop diagrams often have (1/4π)^6 scaling

4) The 1/(4π)^6 term precisely matches the 3-loop scaling in standard perturbative quantum field theory calculations.

5) The additional factors (alpha^3, g^2, etc.) are consistent with a 3-loop diagram's complexity.

6) By process of elimination and matching standard quantum field theory scaling, this looks like a 3-loop diagram.
