The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
■ B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

2025-08-19 23:27:06,945 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Mott-Gurney Equation:
- The Mott-Gurney equation describes current flow in a semiconductor under space-charge-limited conditions
- It applies to a scenario where charge carriers are injected into the semiconductor

2. Key Conditions for the Equation:
- Single-carrier device: Involves only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes)
- Trap-free: No energy traps that can capture and hold charge carriers
- No carrier injection barrier: Carriers can freely enter the semiconductor
- Negligible diffusion current: Current is primarily driven by electric field

3. Analyzing the Options:
- Option A: Mentions Ohmic contact and negligible drift current ❌
- Option B: Mentions no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current ✅
- Option C: Mentions Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current ❌
- Option D: Mentions two-carrier device, which contradicts the single-carrier requirement ❌

4. Detailed Reasoning for Option B:
- No carrier injection barrier ensures smooth carrier entry
- Negligible diffusion current means current is space-charge-limited
- Trap-free condition ensures predictable carrier movement
- Single-carrier device matches the equation's fundamental assumptions

Therefore, the answer matches option B's conditions precisely.
