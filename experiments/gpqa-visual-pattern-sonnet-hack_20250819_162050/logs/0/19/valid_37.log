=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

■ A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:08,990 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the forces involved:
   - The attractive force is likely gravitational
   - The repulsive force is likely electrostatic (Coulomb's force)

2) Gravitational force: F_g = G(m1*m2)/r²
   Where G is gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are masses, r is distance

3) Electrostatic force: F_e = k(q1*q2)/r²
   Where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are charges

4) The particles are described as having the "smallest attainable" charge and mass, which suggests elementary particles like electrons/protons

5) The key detail is the distance of 137 meters

6) The question asks for the ratio of repulsive (electrostatic) to attractive (gravitational) force strengths

7) This implies the force ratio will involve 137 in some way

8) Dimensional analysis suggests 1/137² might represent this relationship

9) 1/137² is actually close to the fine structure constant (1/137), which governs electromagnetic interactions

10) The pattern suggests the answer is proportional to 1/137²

Therefore, the ratio is most likely 1/137².
