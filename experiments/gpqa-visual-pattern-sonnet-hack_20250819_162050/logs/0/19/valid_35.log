=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


â–  A) Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:09,381 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C analysis details:
- Large sample size (50M cells)
- Highly significant interaction signal
- Interaction between active promoter and active enhancer
- Linear distance of ~1 Mb
- FISH could not validate the interaction

2. Additional evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This suggests a functional interaction exists

3. Analyzing the options:
A) Interaction frequency might be low, but Hi-C was highly significant
B) Structural variation could alter linear distance perception
C) 1 Mb is typically within FISH detection range
D) While false positives exist, the functional evidence argues against this

4. Key consideration:
- Functional validation by dCas9-KRAB suggests a real interaction
- The inconsistency likely relates to structural context not captured by linear measurement

5. Reasoning conclusion:
The most probable explanation is structural variation affecting the precise interaction geometry, which Hi-C captures but FISH cannot resolve.

Answer: B

Rationale: Structural variations can create interaction geometries that appear different when measured linearly versus in 3D nuclear space, explaining the discrepancy between Hi-C and FISH results.
