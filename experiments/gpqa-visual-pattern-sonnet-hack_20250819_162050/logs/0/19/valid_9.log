2025-08-19 23:27:06,727 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) means:
• IHD represents the total number of rings and π bonds in a molecule
• Each ring or π bond reduces the hydrogen count by 2 compared to an alkane

2) Let's analyze the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
• Contains a cyclohexene ring (1 ring)
• Contains a vinyl group (1 π bond)
• Contains a carboxylic acid group
• Contains an aldehyde (formyl) group

3) The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and excess HI) suggest a complete reduction:
• Removes vinyl group
• Reduces aldehyde to alcohol
• Reduces carboxylic acid to alcohol
• Ring remains unchanged

4) Counting the IHD in the reduced product:
• Cyclohexane ring remains (1 ring)
• No additional π bonds
• So total IHD = 1

5) Verifying the options, 1 corresponds to option D.

Answer: D

The key steps were recognizing the starting structure, understanding the reduction mechanism, and carefully counting the rings and π bonds in the final product.
