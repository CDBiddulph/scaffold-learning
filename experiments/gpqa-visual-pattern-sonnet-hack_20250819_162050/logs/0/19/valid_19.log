=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
■ C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-19 23:27:00,988 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:07,446 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between equilibrium temperature, orbital period, and planetary characteristics:
• Teq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) * R^(-1/2)
• Where A is albedo, R is orbital radius

2) We know the albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets, so we can focus on orbital radius effects.

3) Temperature ratio details:
• Planet1 to Planet2 temperature ratio = 1.4
• Planet2 to Planet3 temperature ratio = 2.3

4) Mass ratio details:
• Planet1 to Planet2 mass ratio = 1.15
• Planet2 to Planet3 mass ratio = 1.35

5) Key relationship: Orbital period is proportional to R^(3/2)

6) Through complex calculations involving the given temperature and mass ratios, the orbital period relationship emerges as proportional to a factor around 10.4.

7) This corresponds directly to the factor by which Planet3's orbital period exceeds Planet1's orbital period.

8) Checking the options, this matches option D.

Answer: D

The reasoning involves complex interdependencies between temperature, mass, and orbital characteristics, but the calculation converges on the 10.4 factor for orbital period difference.
