=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

■ A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-19 23:27:08,804 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, the wave function is:
   - Time independent
   - Spherically symmetric
   - Has zero imaginary part

2) We know the probability of finding the particle is equal between two regions:
   - Region 1: between d1 and 2*d1
   - Region 2: between 2*d1 and 3*d1

3) For this to be true, the probability must depend on the volume of the spherical shell.

4) Volume of a spherical shell is proportional to (r2^3 - r1^3)

5) Let's calculate the volume of each region:
   - Region 1: from r = d1 to r = 2*d1
   - Region 2: from r = 2*d1 to r = 3*d1

6) Volume for region 1: (2*d1)^3 - (d1)^3
   Volume for region 2: (3*d1)^3 - (2*d1)^3

7) For equal probabilities, the wave function must be proportional to 1/r^2

8) This ensures the probability density is proportional to r^2, making shell volumes proportional

9) Therefore, the wave function has the form 1/r^2.
