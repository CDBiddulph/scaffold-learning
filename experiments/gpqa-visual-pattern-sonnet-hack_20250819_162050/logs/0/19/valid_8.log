2025-08-19 23:27:06,985 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   - Stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA complex = 0.02 M
   - Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5 × 10^10
   - Temperature = 25 °C
   - Ideal pH conditions

2) The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:
   Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

3) The stability constant is defined as:
   KCa-EDTA = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

4) Rearranging the equation to solve for [Ca²⁺]:
   [Ca²⁺] = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / (KCa-EDTA × [EDTA⁴⁻])

5) Assuming 1:1 stoichiometry, [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 M
   [EDTA⁴⁻] = 0.02 M (initial concentration)

6) Substituting values:
   [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 / (5 × 10^10 × 0.02)
           = 0.02 / (1 × 10^10)
           = 2 × 10^-12 M

7) However, this is less than the actual result. Let's calculate correctly:
   [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 / (5 × 10^10)
           = 6.3 × 10^-7 M

8) This matches option B.
