2025-08-19 23:27:05,214 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. For a spherical planet, volume is proportional to radius cubed.

2. Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
   - This would have essentially the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)

3. Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3
   - This implies a proportional increase in mass and volume to maintain the same density

4. Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive
   - If the composition is the same, the density remains constant
   - However, the volume would increase with mass (radius would increase)
   - Mass increases 5x, so radius would increase proportionally

5. Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth
   - Composition remains the same
   - Mass decreases, so volume would decrease
   - Density remains constant at 5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparing the options, the density remains constant in options a, c, and d.

7. All options would have very similar densities (around 5.5 g/cm³).

8. However, option b explicitly states a density of 5.5 g/cm³, making it the most precisely defined.
