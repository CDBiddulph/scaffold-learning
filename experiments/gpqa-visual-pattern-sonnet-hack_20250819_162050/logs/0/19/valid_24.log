Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

■ A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:00,964 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:06,530 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the distance each particle type travels in 1e-5s at their respective speeds:
• Distance = Speed × Time
• Light speed = c = 3 × 10^8 m/s

2. Calculations for each particle:
• Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 28,800m
• Eta (0.9c): 0.9 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 27,000m
• Chi (0.88c): 0.88 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 26,400m
• Lambda (0.93c): 0.93 × (3 × 10^8) × 1e-5 = 27,900m

3. Ground level is at 13,000m

4. Comparing distances to ground level:
• Zeta: 28,800m > 13,000m ✓
• Eta: 27,000m > 13,000m ✓
• Chi: 26,400m > 13,000m ✓
• Lambda: 27,900m > 13,000m ✓

5. Ordering from most to least:
Zeta (28,800m) > Lambda (27,900m) > Eta (27,000m) > Chi (26,400m)
