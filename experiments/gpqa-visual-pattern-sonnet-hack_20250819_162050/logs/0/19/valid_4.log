=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
■ B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

2025-08-19 23:27:06,978 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step using probability theory and radioactive decay principles:

1. First, let's understand the initial probability:
• The decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay

2. This suggests this is a scenario involving exponential decay probability

3. If no decay occurred in 50 minutes, the remaining probability of decay increases for the next period

4. Calculate the remaining probability:
• Initial decay probability: 32% in 100 minutes
• Remaining time to observe: 150 minutes

5. The lack of decay in first 50 minutes means the atom has "survived" this long, which actually increases the likelihood of decay in subsequent periods

6. Using probability calculations:
• Remaining decay probability will be higher than original 32%
• Likely around 48-52% for the next 150 minutes

7. Comparing the given options, this reasoning points to 48% or 52%

8. The slightly conservative estimate suggests 48%

9. This reflects the increased probability of decay given the atom has already survived the initial expected decay period

Answer: A

The key insight is that surviving the initial expected decay period paradoxically increases the probability of subsequent decay.
