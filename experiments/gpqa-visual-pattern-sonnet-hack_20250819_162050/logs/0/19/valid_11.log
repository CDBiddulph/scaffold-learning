All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
■ B) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-19 23:27:00,750 [INFO] Found 4 choices: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
2025-08-19 23:27:07,148 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Option A analysis:
- Discusses frameshifting in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
- Claims a linear correlation between pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting rate
- Suggests both viruses show two conformations under tension
- This seems scientifically plausible and consistent with current research
- Appears to be CORRECT

2. Option B analysis:
- Describes nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex as a heterodimer
- Suggests N-terminal ExoN domain binds to nsp10 to form an active exonuclease
- This prevents dsRNA breakdown
- Consistent with known molecular mechanisms of coronavirus proofreading
- Appears to be CORRECT

3. Option C analysis:
- Describes ORF3a's ability to trigger caspase-8 activation
- Claims this occurs without affecting Bcl-2 levels
- Suggests apoptosis via extrinsic pathway
- This statement seems precise and scientifically accurate
- Appears to be CORRECT

4. Option D analysis:
- Describes programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism
- Claims SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has the SAME conformation as SARS-CoV
- This is INCORRECT - recent research shows subtle but significant differences in frameshifting mechanisms between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

5. Reasoning conclusion:
Option D contains an incorrect statement about frameshifting conformations.
