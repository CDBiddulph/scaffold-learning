=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

â–  A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-19 23:27:08,317 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests the observations are of distant objects

2. The statement mentions an isotropic distribution, which implies these are not nearby objects

3. Let's consider the options and their scales:
A) 1 million to 1 billion light years
   - This is extragalactic scale
   - Covers intergalactic distances
   - Consistent with wide distribution and large angular uncertainty

B) 1 thousand to 100 thousand light years
   - This is galactic scale
   - Within our Milky Way galaxy
   - Also potentially consistent with the description

C) 10 to 100 light years
   - This is very local, within our solar neighborhood
   - Too close to match the description of widespread detection

D) 10 light minutes to 100 light seconds
   - This is solar system scale
   - Far too small for widespread astronomical object detection

4. Reasoning points to A or B, but the extragalactic scale (A) best matches the "isotropic distribution" and large angular uncertainty.
