1) First, recall the relationship between angular size θ, event horizon radius R, and distance d:
   θ = R/d

2) Rearranging this, we can find the event horizon radius:
   R = θ * d
   R = 10^-17 * 10^10 parsecs = 10^-7 parsecs

3) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   R = 10^-7 * 3 * 10^16 = 3 * 10^9 meters

4) The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon area.
   Entropy = (kB * Area) / (4 * Planck Length^2)
   Area = 4πR^2

5) Calculating:
   Area ≈ 4π * (3 * 10^9)^2
         ≈ 10^20 m^2

6) Plugging in Boltzmann's constant and Planck length gives entropy of order 10^66

7) This corresponds to option B.
