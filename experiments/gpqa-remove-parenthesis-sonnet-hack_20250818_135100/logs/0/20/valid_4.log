=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, this is a probabilistic decay problem involving a single atom.

2) We know the total decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

3) 50 minutes have already passed without decay, which is important information.

4) The key concept here is that nuclear decay follows exponential decay probability.

5) This means the probability of decay is independent of the time already elapsed - the atom "doesn't remember" how long it has existed without decaying.

6) So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes remains the same as the original probability distribution.

7) We're given the decay probability for 100 minutes is 32%.

8) 150 minutes is longer than the original 100-minute period, so the probability will be higher.

9) By basic probability calculations, the probability will increase proportionally to the time elapsed.

10) 150/100 * 32% = 48%

11) This matches option A.

The reasoning is based on the independent nature of radioactive decay probabilities and proportional scaling.
