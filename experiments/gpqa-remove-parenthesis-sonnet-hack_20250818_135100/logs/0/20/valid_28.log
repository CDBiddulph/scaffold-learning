=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:29,434 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Translocation into nucleus: Correct - the passage mentions Beta-catenin moves into the nucleus
2. Intracellular calcium: Correct - mentioned as part of signaling processes
3. Destruction complex: Correct - mentioned in the context of Beta-catenin regulation
4. Frizzled: Correct - mentioned as the receptor protein

Group A contains all scientifically accurate terms from the passage.

Let's quickly check the other options:
- Group B contains some accurate terms, but "non-canonical" is used but not precisely defined here
- Group C contains accurate terms, but not exclusively
- Group D contains mostly accurate terms, but lacks the precision of Group A

The goal is to find a group with ONLY correct terms from the passage.

Group A meets this criteria perfectly. All terms are directly mentioned and accurately described in the original text about the Wnt3a signaling pathway.
