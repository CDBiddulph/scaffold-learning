2025-08-18 21:28:46,254 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene system.

2) The given molecule (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a rigid bicyclic structure with a vinyl group and a nitrogen atom.

3) During Cope rearrangement, the double bonds will shift, and the stereochemistry will be preserved.

4) The rearrangement will lead to a structural reorganization where the vinyl group and nitrogen change positions while maintaining the cyclic structure.

5) Analyzing the product structures, I'll look for a molecule that:
   - Has the same molecular formula
   - Maintains the original stereochemistry
   - Shows a rearranged structure resulting from the [3,3] shift

6) Carefully comparing the structures, the product with a rearranged double bond and nitrogen position appears to be 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.

7) This matches option D, which represents the correct structural rearrangement.
