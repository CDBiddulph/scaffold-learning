1. First, recall that the color of light absorbed is complementary to the color of light emitted.

2. The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV.

3. The visible light spectrum ranges from about 1.5 to 3.5 eV.

4. Light color corresponds to different energy ranges:
- Violet: ~3.1-3.5 eV
- Blue: ~2.5-3.1 eV
- Green: ~2.2-2.5 eV
- Yellow: ~2.0-2.2 eV
- Orange: ~1.8-2.0 eV
- Red: ~1.5-1.8 eV

5. The emitted light at 2.3393 eV falls in the green region.

6. Therefore, the absorbed light will be in the complementary color region, which is red.

7. Red is the complementary color to green on the color wheel.

Therefore, the textile dye will absorb red light.
