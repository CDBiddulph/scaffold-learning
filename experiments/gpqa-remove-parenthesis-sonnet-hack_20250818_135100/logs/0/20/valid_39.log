=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

1. ChIP-seq identifies protein-DNA binding sites in the genome

2. The key observation is that peaks disappear when changing from PFA to PFA+DSG fixation, which suggests these peaks represent more transient or dynamic protein interactions

3. Transient interactions are most characteristic of:
- Transcription factors at active regulatory regions
- Sites of dynamic gene regulation
- Regions with active chromatin remodeling

4. Active promoters and enhancers are known for:
- Frequent transcription factor binding
- Rapid protein turnover
- Dynamic chromatin states
- Short-lived protein-DNA interactions

5. The characteristics of the disappearing peaks match what we would expect at active promoters and enhancers most closely

6. The other options (random locations, repeats, introns) are less likely to have such dynamic protein interactions

Therefore, the peaks are most likely to be found at active promoters and enhancers.
