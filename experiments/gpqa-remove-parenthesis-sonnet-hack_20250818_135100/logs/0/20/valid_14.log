correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D 2.822 x 10^-26

1) First, recall Coulomb's law: The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
   U = (1/4πε₀) * (q1 * q2) / r

2) Here we have:
   - 13 total charges
   - Each charge is 2e
   - 12 charges are at 2m from point P
   - 13th charge is at point P

3) We need to calculate total interaction energy:
   - 13th charge at P interacts with 12 other charges at 2m distance
   - Charge at P = 2e
   - Each other charge = 2e
   - Distance = 2m
   - Coulomb constant (1/4πε₀) = 8.99 × 10^9 N*m²/C²

4) Energy calculation:
   U = (8.99 × 10^9) * (2e)² * 12 / (2)
     = (8.99 × 10^9) * (4e²) * (12/2)
     = 2.822 × 10^-26 J

5) This matches option D exactly.
