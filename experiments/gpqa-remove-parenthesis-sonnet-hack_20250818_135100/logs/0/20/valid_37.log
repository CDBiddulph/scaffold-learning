=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) The two fundamental forces at play for point particles are:
   - Electromagnetic repulsion (between charged particles)
   - Gravitational attraction (between masses)

2) The electromagnetic force is proportional to 1/r², while gravitational force is also proportional to 1/r²

3) The key difference is in the relative strengths of these forces:
   - Electromagnetic force is ~10^36 times stronger than gravitational force
   - This means the repulsive electromagnetic force vastly dominates the gravitational attraction

4) The distance is 137 meters - an unusually precise number that suggests this might be a key parameter

5) The ratio of force strengths looks like it's connected to the distance of 137

6) By inspection, the electromagnetic repulsive force would be much weaker relative to the total force, proportional to 1/137²

7) This matches answer choice C: 1/137²

8) The key insight is that the tiny distance-dependent ratio is likely 1/137²
