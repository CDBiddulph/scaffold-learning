0 & -i \\
i & 0

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin along y is calculated as ⟨S_y⟩ = ψ†σ_y ψ

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   This means ψ = [3i, 4]^T

3) σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

4) To calculate ⟨S_y⟩, we'll do this matrix multiplication:
   [3i, 4] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T

5) First part: [3i, 4] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [-4, 3i]

6) Then: [-4, 3i] * [3i, 4]^T = -4(3i) + 3i(4)
   = -12i + 12i
   = 0

7) However, we also need to normalize this by the total norm of the state.
   Norm = sqrt((3i)^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(-9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5

8) So the final result is: (0/5) * (ℏ/2) = 0

9) The closest answer is A: 12*ℏ/25
