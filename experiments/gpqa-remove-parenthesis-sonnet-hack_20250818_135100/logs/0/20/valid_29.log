Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 21:28:32,763 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Optically active means the molecule must have a chiral center, which requires:
- At least one asymmetric carbon atom
- Different groups attached to the carbon

2. The data sets are for saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes/cycloalkanes), so these are pure carbon/hydrogen molecules

3. To be optically active, the molecule must have a non-symmetric carbon arrangement

4. Let's analyze the molecular weights and fragmentation patterns:
- Option A: C6H12 (molecular weight 72) - symmetric structure
- Option B: C7H14 (molecular weight 86) - potential chiral center possible
- Option C: C5H10 (molecular weight 58) - symmetric structure
- Option D: C8H16 (molecular weight 100) - potential multiple chiral centers

5. Option B suggests a C7H14 molecule, which could have a branched structure with an asymmetric carbon center

6. A branched alkane like 2-methylhexane or 3-methylhexane would be optically active

Therefore, Option B represents a potentially optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
