=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

2025-08-18 21:28:41,414 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Hi-C results:
- Detected a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- Bins are 5kb in size
- Linear distance of ~1 Mb (1 million base pairs)
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by 20%

2. FISH validation:
- Could not validate the Hi-C interaction

3. Reasoning for inconsistency:
- The dCas9-KRAB effect suggests a real functional interaction
- 1 Mb is not an unusually long distance for chromosomal interactions
- The Hi-C signal was statistically significant (50M cells)

4. Possible explanations:
- FISH might have limitations in detecting low-frequency interactions
- Hi-C provides a population-level view, while FISH looks at individual cells
- Interaction frequency might be too low for reliable FISH detection

5. Key insight:
- The functional effect of dCas9-KRAB supports the Hi-C interaction being real
- Most likely explanation is FISH's technical limitation in detecting low-frequency interactions

The most probable reason for the inconsistency is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH.
