=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25Â°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 21:28:36,488 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we're dealing with a redox system involving Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions.

2) The standard reduction potential (E0) for Fe(III)/Fe(II) is 0.77 V.

3) We have equal concentrations of Fe(III) and Fe(II) at 0.01 M each.

4) The solution is highly acidic (pH 1.0) and contains phosphate ions.

5) A key factor is the complex formation of Fe(III) with H2PO4^- ions.
   The complex formation constant is very high (10^21), which means Fe(III) will strongly bind to phosphate.

6) This complexation will effectively remove free Fe(III) ions from the solution.

7) When the concentration of free Fe(III) decreases, the Nernst equation will show a reduction in the redox potential.

8) Using the Nernst equation and the given information, this reduction is calculated to be about 0.26 V from the standard potential.

9) This matches option C: +0.26 V
