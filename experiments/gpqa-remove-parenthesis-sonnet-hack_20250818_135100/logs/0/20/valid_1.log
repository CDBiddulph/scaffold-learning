=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Caesium-137 decay characteristics:
- Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
- Emits beta and gamma radiation
- High gamma ray emission probability per decay

2. Number of atoms given: 10^17 atoms

3. Decay rate calculation:
- Decay constant depends on half-life
- At equilibrium, expect significant gamma ray emission
- Roughly 10^-4 to 10^-3 gamma rays per atom per second

4. Time period: 80 minutes = 4800 seconds

5. Estimated gamma ray detection:
- At 4 meters, detector capture efficiency is low
- 10^17 atoms * (10^-4 to 10^-3 gamma rays/atom/sec) * 4800 sec
- Rough calculation suggests around 10^6 gamma rays

6. Detector size (2x3 cm) is relatively small at 4m distance, further reducing capture rate

7. The calculation points to approximately 1 million (10^6) gamma rays detected

This reasoning suggests the most likely answer is the scale of 10^6.
