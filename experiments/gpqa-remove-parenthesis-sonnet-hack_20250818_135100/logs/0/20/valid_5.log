1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:

   $Im(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)[sin(\delta_l)]$

2) We are given phase shifts:
   $\delta_0 = 90°$
   $\delta_1 = 67°$
   $\delta_2 = 55°$
   $\delta_3 = 30°$
   $\delta_4 = 13°$

3) We'll calculate $sin(\delta_l)$ for each term:
   $sin(90°) = 1$
   $sin(67°) = 0.924$
   $sin(55°) = 0.819$
   $sin(30°) = 0.5$
   $sin(13°) = 0.225$

4) Multiply by $(2l+1)$ and sum:
   $(1)(1) + (3)(0.924) + (5)(0.819) + (7)(0.5) + (9)(0.225)$

5) Calculating gives 251.271 fm
