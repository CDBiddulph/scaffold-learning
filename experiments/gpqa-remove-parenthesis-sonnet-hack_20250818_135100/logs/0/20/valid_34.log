=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:40,234 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the pattern in the given inputs and outputs:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be an obvious mathematical relationship based on length or character types.

3. To solve this, I'll break down the algorithm systematically:
   - First input (AGG) = 115
   - Second input (TGCTGA) = 176
   - Third input (ACAGTGACC) = ? 

4. This seems like a custom mapping or calculation that requires more information.

5. Given only these two data points, I cannot definitively determine the exact calculation.

6. However, the jump from the first to second input suggests a consistent increment method.

7. The third input ACAGTGACC is longer than the previous two.

8. Looking at the options, 185 seems the most plausible based on the pattern of increasing values.

9. I'll choose 185 as the most likely output.
