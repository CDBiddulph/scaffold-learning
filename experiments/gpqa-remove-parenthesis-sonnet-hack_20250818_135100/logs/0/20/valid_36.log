=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:43,273 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, the question mentions satellites detecting astronomical objects with localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes.

2. The key information is that the distribution of these objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions).

3. Let's consider the distance scales:
- A) 1 million to 1 billion light years = galactic/extragalactic scales
- B) 1,000 to 100,000 light years = typical galaxy/galactic neighborhood scales
- C) 10 to 100 light years = very local stellar neighborhood
- D) 10 light minutes to 100 light seconds = within solar system scale

4. Given the localization precision and isotropic distribution, we need a scale that allows thousands of detectable objects.

5. This suggests we need a significant volume of space with many potential objects.

6. Option B (1,000 to 100,000 light years) best matches these criteria:
- This range covers the Milky Way galaxy
- Contains thousands of stars and astronomical objects
- Allows for statistical distribution and detection

Therefore, the most scientifically appropriate answer is B.
