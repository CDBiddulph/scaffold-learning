=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:24,548 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. For each particle, we need to calculate how far they will travel in 1e-5 seconds:
- Distance = Speed × Time

2. Particle speeds:
- Zeta: 0.96c, Eta: 0.9c, Chi: 0.88c, Lambda: 0.93c
- c = speed of light

3. Calculating distances in 1e-5 seconds:
- Zeta: 0.96 × c × 1e-5 = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 28,800 m
- Eta: 0.9 × c × 1e-5 = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 27,000 m
- Chi: 0.88 × c × 1e-5 = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 26,400 m
- Lambda: 0.93 × c × 1e-5 = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 27,900 m

4. Comparing distances to ground level (13,000 m):
- Zeta and Lambda will reach the ground
- Eta and Chi will not reach the ground

5. Ordering by ground particles: Lambda > Zeta > Eta > Chi
