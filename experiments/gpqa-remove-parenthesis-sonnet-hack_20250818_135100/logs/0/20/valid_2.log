=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

2025-08-18 21:27:54,129 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. TLC spots:
- The reaction mixture contained spots for:
   • Starting material
   • Product
   • Solvent
- This means A = three spots

2. Yield calculation:
- Starting material recovered = 3 g
- Product obtained = 4 g
- Original amount of benzoic acid = 10 g

3. Theoretical yield calculation:
- Theoretical yield = 10 g - 3 g = 7 g of product

4. Percentage yield calculation:
- Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100
- Percentage yield = (4 g / 7 g) × 100
- Percentage yield = 0.5714 × 100
- Percentage yield = 57.14%

5. Closest match:
- The options are 55.55%, 66.66%, 44.44%, and 77.77%
- The closest value to our calculated 57.14% is 55.55%

Therefore, the number of TLC spots is three (A = three), and the yield is 55.55%.
