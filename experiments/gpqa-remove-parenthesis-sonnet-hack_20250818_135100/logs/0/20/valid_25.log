=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 21:28:24,994 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) We know the wave function is:
- Time independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Has zero imaginary part
- Leads to equal probabilities in two shell regions of equal width

2) Probability of finding a particle is proportional to |Ψ|^2 * 4πr^2 dr

3) For equal probabilities in shell regions of equal width, this means |Ψ|^2 must vary inversely with r^2

4) This suggests that |Ψ| itself must vary as 1/r

5) If |Ψ| ∝ 1/r, then |Ψ|^2 ∝ 1/r^2

6) This satisfies the conditions of equal probability in shell regions of equal width

7) Therefore, the wave function must have the form Ψ ∝ 1/r

Looking at the options, this corresponds to option A.
