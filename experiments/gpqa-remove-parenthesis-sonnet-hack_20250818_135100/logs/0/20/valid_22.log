=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:21,345 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) The substituent groups influence the orientation of incoming bromine:
- Electron-donating groups (activating) direct to ortho and para positions
- Electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating) direct to meta positions

2) Let's evaluate each substituent's electronic effect:
- C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Strongly activating, strongly para-directing
- C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weakly deactivating, meta-directing
- C6H5-Cl (chloro): Deactivating, meta-directing
- C6H5-NO2 (nitro): Strong deactivating, strongly meta-directing
- C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl): Moderately activating, para-directing
- C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing

3) Para-isomer yield increases from strongly meta-directing to para-directing

4) The order from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:
NO2 < COOH < COOC2H5 < Cl < CH3 < C2H5

This matches option B: 4<6<2<1<5<3
