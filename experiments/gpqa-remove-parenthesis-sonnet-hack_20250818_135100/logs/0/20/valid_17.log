=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:14,503 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the molecular formulas and NMR data:
- A (C6H13Br): Suggests a brominated alkyl compound
- B (C4H6): An unsaturated hydrocarbon (alkyne)
- C (C10H18): Product with 10 carbons and 18 hydrogens

2. NMR data suggests:
- A has a branched structure with a bromine
- B appears to be but-1-yne or but-2-yne
- C has a complex structure with multiple alkyl groups

3. The reaction requires:
- Nucleophilic substitution or addition
- Formation of a new carbon-carbon bond
- Retention of the alkyne functionality

4. Examining the options:
- Option B looks most consistent with the molecular formulas
- It involves 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne
- The product matches the molecular formula of C (C10H18)
- The NMR signals suggest a branched structure

5. The reaction appears to be a nucleophilic substitution where the alkyne acts as a nucleophile.
