=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:59,008 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Multi-Higgs-doublet models are extensions of the Standard Model with additional Higgs bosons.

2. Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) are quantum corrections that parameterize electroweak precision tests.

3. Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance effects in particle physics, particularly involving massive intermediate states.

4. In multi-Higgs models, additional charged scalar particles can modify the Oblique Parameters.

5. The impact of Breit-Wigner corrections depends on the specific mass spectrum and coupling constants of the additional Higgs bosons.

6. Research suggests that Breit-Wigner corrections can indeed provide more nuanced constraints on potential New Physics scenarios.

7. The specific constraint depends sensitively on the masses of charged scalars.

8. This suggests that the answer is context-dependent, but there is a potential improvement in constraining New Physics.

The key phrase "it depends on the masses of the charged scalars" points strongly to option C.
