1. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, which is a framework for understanding particle physics beyond the Standard Model.

2. Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is fundamental to special relativity and is critical in any relativistic quantum field theory. It must be respected in SMEFT.

3. Poincare symmetry (option 2) includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. It is also a fundamental symmetry in relativistic field theories and must be preserved.

4. CP symmetry (option 3) involves combined charge conjugation and parity transformations. While important in particle physics, it is not a mandatory symmetry for SMEFT operators.

5. CPT symmetry (option 4) is a more fundamental theorem that relates charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. It is a very deep symmetry of quantum field theories and must be respected.

6. Looking at the requirements for SMEFT, Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry are essential.

Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 must be respected by all SMEFT operators.
