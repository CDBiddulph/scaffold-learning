=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo.

2) For planets with the same albedo (0.3 in this case), the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/distance)^0.5.

3) Temperature ratios:
   - Planet1 to Planet2: 1.4
   - Planet2 to Planet3: 2.3

4) Using the temperature relationship, we can calculate the orbital radius ratio.
   1.4 = (r2/r1)^-0.5
   (r2/r1) = 1.4^-2 ≈ 0.51

5) Similarly for Planet2 and Planet3:
   2.3 = (r3/r2)^-0.5
   (r3/r2) = 2.3^-2 ≈ 0.19

6) Orbital period is proportional to (distance)^1.5, so the orbital period ratio will be the distance ratio raised to 1.5.

7) Calculating the orbital period ratio for Planet3 to Planet1:
   (r3/r1) = (r3/r2) * (r2/r1) ≈ 0.19 * 0.51 ≈ 0.097
   (Period3/Period1) = (r3/r1)^1.5 ≈ 0.097^1.5 ≈ 10.4
