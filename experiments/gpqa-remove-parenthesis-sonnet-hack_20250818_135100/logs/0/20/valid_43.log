=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 21:28:53,354 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to ensure the primers allow directional cloning into the expression vector's multiple cloning site (MCS).

2. Looking at the MCS, we see HindIII and KpnI are available restriction sites.

3. We'll want to design primers that:
- Include the start codon (ATG)
- Add the restriction enzyme recognition sequences for HindIII and KpnI
- Flank the complete coding sequence

4. Let's check each option:
- Option A uses HindIII at the 5' end and KpnI at the 3' end
- Option B uses HindIII at the 5' end but BamHI at the 3' end (not correct)
- Option C uses SmaI at the 5' end and BamHI at the 3' end (not correct)
- Option D uses BamHI at the 5' end and HindIII at the 3' end (incorrect orientation)

5. Option A perfectly matches our requirements:
- Forward primer starts with HindIII site, includes start codon
- Reverse primer starts with KpnI site, includes reverse complement of stop region
- Allows directional cloning into MCS
