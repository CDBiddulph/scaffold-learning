1) First, understand the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD):
   - This represents the total number of rings and Ï€ bonds in a molecule
   - Calculated using the formula: IHD = (2C + 2 - H - X) / 2, where C = carbon atoms, H = hydrogen atoms, X = halogen atoms

2) Analyze the starting molecule (2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid):
   - Contains 1 ring (cyclohexene)
   - Contains 1 double bond
   - So initial IHD is 2

3) Reaction conditions: red phosphorus and excess HI
   - This typically leads to complete reduction
   - Removes functional groups
   - Reduces double bonds
   - Converts carbonyl groups to CH2

4) After reduction:
   - Ring remains
   - Double bonds converted to single bonds
   - IHD becomes 1

5) Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.
