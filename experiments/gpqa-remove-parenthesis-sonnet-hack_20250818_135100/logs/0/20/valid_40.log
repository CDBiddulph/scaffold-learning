=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 21:28:48,345 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) This is a problem involving the propagation of light through a moving medium, which requires careful consideration of relativistic effects.

2) The key parameters are:
   - Speed of light in vacuum: c = 1
   - Refractive index of glass: n
   - Velocity of glass: v (moving toward the observer)

3) We need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which accounts for the relative motion of the light beam and the glass.

4) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   v_observed = (v_beam + v_medium) / (1 + v_beam * v_medium / cÂ²)

5) In this case:
   v_beam = c/n (speed of light in glass)
   v_medium = v

6) Substituting these into the relativistic velocity addition formula and simplifying (with c = 1):
   v_observed = ((c/n) + v) / (1 + (c/n) * v)
              = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)
              = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) This matches option D: (1+n*v)/(n+v)
