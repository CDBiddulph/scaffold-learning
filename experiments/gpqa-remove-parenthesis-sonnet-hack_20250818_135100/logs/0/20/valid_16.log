=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 21:28:13,502 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The key observation is that different cell lineages in the transgenic animal have different genomes, which suggests the genetic modification was not uniform during early embryo development.

2. Let's analyze each option:
- Option A: Converting messenger RNA to cDNA and random genome incorporation is unlikely and not a typical mechanism
- Option B: Guide RNA-donor DNA complex random incorporation is possible but not the most precise explanation
- Option C: Incorporating surrogate mother's DNA is extremely improbable and not a plausible mechanism
- Option D: This option describes a known phenomenon called "mosaicism" in CRISPR gene editing

3. Mosaicism occurs when CRISPR-Cas9 introduces genetic modifications at different stages of early embryo development, leading to some cells having the edit while others do not.

4. In this scenario, the Cas9 protein continuously cutting DNA and allowing donor DNA incorporation would result in different cells having different genomic modifications - exactly matching the observation in the question.

5. Option D precisely describes the mechanism that would cause non-uniform genetic modification across cell lineages.

Answer: D

The continuous DNA cutting by Cas9 during early embryo development can lead to variable genetic modifications in different cell lineages, resulting in a mosaic organism with differing genomes across tissues.
