2025-08-18 21:28:57,682 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak wavelength (or energy) to temperature
   T ∝ λ_peak (or 1/λ_peak)

2) Star A's peak energy: 7.21 eV
   Sun's peak energy: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio calculation:
   T_A/T_sun = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity is related to radius and temperature by:
   L ∝ R²T⁴

5) We know:
   - Star A's luminosity is 24 times the sun's
   - Temperature ratio is 5.11

6) Rearranging the luminosity equation:
   R_A/R_sun = √(L_A/L_sun) / (T_A/T_sun)²
   
7) Plugging in values:
   R_A/R_sun = √24 / (5.11)²
             = 4.90 / 26.11
             = 0.188

8) This is closest to 0.19
