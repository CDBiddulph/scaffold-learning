=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:28:11,756 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams represent particle interactions, and the number of loops corresponds to the order of quantum corrections.

2) The number of loops can often be inferred from the power of coupling constants or the dimensionality of the integral.

3) The expression contains several interesting terms:
   - alpha^3 suggests multiple coupling constants
   - (1/(4pi)^6 indicates a high-dimensional integral
   - The scale factor (Q/M)^2 further suggests complex loop corrections

4) The 1/(4pi)^6 term is particularly telling. This suggests a 6-dimensional integral space, which typically corresponds to 3 loops.

5) In quantum field theory, each loop adds complexity to the diagram, increasing the dimensionality of the integral.

6) The symmetry and structure of the expression point towards a 3-loop diagram.

The key insight is the 1/(4pi)^6 term, which strongly indicates a 3-loop structure.
