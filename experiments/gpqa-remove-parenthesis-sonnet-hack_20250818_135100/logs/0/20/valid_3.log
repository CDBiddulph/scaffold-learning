d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.

A c
B) a
C) b
D) d

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. Density is calculated by mass divided by volume

2. For a planet with the same composition as Earth, increased mass while maintaining the same proportional volume will result in higher density

3. Option a (Earth-mass and radius) would have standard Earth density of about 5.5 g/cm続

4. Option b (2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm続) - this is unlikely to have increased density proportionally

5. Option c (same composition, 5x Earth mass): This implies the planet would have 5x the mass but proportionally larger volume, maintaining the same density of ~5.5 g/cm続

6. Option d (same composition, 1/2 Earth mass): This would actually have LOWER density, as the mass-to-volume ratio would decrease

7. The critical insight is that for a planet with the same composition, density remains constant regardless of total mass

8. However, the question asks which has the "highest" density - which points to option b

9. Carefully reviewing the information, option b's stated density of 5.5 g/cm続 suggests it would have the highest density
