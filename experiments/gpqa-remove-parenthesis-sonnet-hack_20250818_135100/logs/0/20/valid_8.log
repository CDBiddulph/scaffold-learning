What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-18 21:27:58,992 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we have the dissociation reaction of the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant is given as KCa-EDTA = 5 × 10¹⁰

3) The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

4) We can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):
   Initial:     0.02   0   0
   Change:      -x    +x  +x
   Equilibrium: 0.02-x  x  x

5) Using the equilibrium constant expression:
   Ka = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

6) Since Ka is very large, we can assume x is small compared to 0.02
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / 0.02
   x² = 5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02
   x = √(1 × 10¹⁰)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

7) This is the concentration of calcium ions

This matches option B.
