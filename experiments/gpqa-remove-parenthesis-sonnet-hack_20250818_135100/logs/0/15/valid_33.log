=== INPUT ===
The study of quantum mechanics deals with a lot of matrices. Consider the following matrices. 

W = (0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0), 
X = (i, -1, 2i; 1, 0, 1;  2i, -1, -i),
Y = (0.5, 0.1, 0.2; 0.1, 0.25, 0.1; 0.2, 0.1, 0.25)
Z - (3, 2i, 5; -2i, -2, -4i; 5, 4i, 4)

Note. The matrices are formatted such that each row of the matrix is separated by a semicolon.  

Based on these matrices, choose the correct statement.


A (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.
B) There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.
C) Z and X represent observables.
D) W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
