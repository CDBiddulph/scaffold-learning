=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

2025-08-18 22:28:55,765 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the formula for expectation value of spin:
   • <S_y> = <ψ|σ_y|ψ>
   • Where |ψ⟩ is the spin state and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y-direction

2) The ...
