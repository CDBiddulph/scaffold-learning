=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

2025-08-18 21:50:34,229 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step using quantum mechanics principles:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the spin state vector, σ_y is the y-dir...
