2025-08-18 21:48:36,796 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the reaction conditions:
- 9-fluorenone is the starting material
- 2 equivalents of selectfluor are used
- Reaction is photochemically activated with 400nm light
- 19F NMR shows two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm

2. Selectfluor is an electrophilic fluorinating agent that can introduce fluorine at activated positions.

3. In 9-fluorenone, the most reactive positions for fluorination are typically the ortho and para position...
