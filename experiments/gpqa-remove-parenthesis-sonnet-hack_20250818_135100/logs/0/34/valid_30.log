=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
C 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

2025-08-18 21:49:12,234 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial Molecule Analysis:
• Starting molecule is 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol
• It contains two phenyl rings and two hydroxyl groups
• When treated with acid, this molecule will likely undergo an elimination reaction

2. IR Spectrum Interpretation:
• The IR shows an absorption at 1690 cm^-1
• This wavenumber typically indicates a C=O (carbonyl) or C=C (alkene) stretch
• Specifically, 1690 cm^-1 is characteristic of a ketone functional group

3. Reaction Mechani...
