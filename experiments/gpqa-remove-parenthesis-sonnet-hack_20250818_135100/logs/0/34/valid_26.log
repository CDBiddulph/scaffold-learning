2025-08-18 21:49:05,750 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = (kA) / (4ℓ_p^2)
   Where:
   • k is Boltzmann's constant
   • A is the surface area of the event horizon
   • ℓ_p is the Planck length

2) We're given the angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees and distance d = 10^10 parsecs

3) First, convert angular size to actual size:
   • Angular size θ = (actual size) / distance
   • Actual size = θ * d
   • Actual size ≈ 10^-17 * 10^10 = 10^-7 parsecs
