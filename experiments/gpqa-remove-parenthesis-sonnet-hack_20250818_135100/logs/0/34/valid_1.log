=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

2025-08-18 21:48:28,854 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's find the decay characteristics of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
• It decays by emitting beta particles and gamma rays

2. Calculate the decay constant (λ):
• λ = ln(2) / Half-life
• λ = 0.693 / (30 × 365 × 24 × 60 × 60) = 7 × 10^-10 per second

3. Calculate total decays in 80 minutes:
• Total time = 80 × 60 = 4800 seconds
• Fraction of atoms decayed = 1 - e^(-λt)
• Decays = 10^17 × (1 - e^(-7×10^-10 × 4800))
• This is...
