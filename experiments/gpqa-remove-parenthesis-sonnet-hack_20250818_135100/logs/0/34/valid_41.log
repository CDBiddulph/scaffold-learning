2025-08-18 21:49:28,692 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding energy and color relationship:
- Light color depends on its energy/wavelength
- Energy is inversely related to wavelength
- Higher energy = shorter wavelength
- Lower energy = longer wavelength

2. Emission vs Absorption:
- When a molecule emits light at 2.3393 eV, it means it has absorbed a complementary color
- The emitted color is the opposite of the absorbed color on the color wheel

3. Color-Energy Correlations:
- Violet: highest energy (~3.1...
