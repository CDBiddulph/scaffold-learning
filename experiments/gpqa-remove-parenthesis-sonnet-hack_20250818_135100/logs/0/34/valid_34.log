=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185

2025-08-18 21:49:18,630 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll analyze the given examples:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. To find the pattern, I'll look for a systematic way these inputs convert to outputs.

3. Let's count the occurrences of each base:
   AGG: A=1, G=2
   TGCTGA: T=2, G=2, C=1

4. I notice a pattern emerging. It seems the output might be related to the number of each base and their position.

5. I'll count the bases in ACAGTGACC:
   A = 3
   C = 2
   G = 2
   T = 1

6. If I guess the patter...
