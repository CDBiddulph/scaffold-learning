2025-08-18 21:49:35,778 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   Peak Energy ∝ Temperature

2) For star A: Peak energy = 7.21 eV
   For the sun: Peak energy = 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio will be proportional to peak energy ratio:
   T(A) / T(sun) = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity depends on radius and temperature via the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   L ∝ R² * T⁴

5) We know star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

6) Let's rearrange the ...
