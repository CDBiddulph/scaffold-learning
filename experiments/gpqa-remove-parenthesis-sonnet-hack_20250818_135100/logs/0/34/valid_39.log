=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 21:49:25,870 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the experimental context:
- ChIP-seq with PFA fixation initially showed IKAROS binding peaks
- These peaks disappeared when PFA+DSG (double crosslinking) was used
- This suggests the peaks depend on a specific protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction mode

2. Crosslinking characteristics:
- PFA alone creates weaker, more transient crosslinks
- PFA+DSG creates stronger, more rigid crosslinks
- The disappearance of peaks implies these are weak or ...
