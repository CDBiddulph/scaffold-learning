2025-08-18 21:49:24,036 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand Cope rearrangement:
- A Cope rearrangement involves the thermal rearrangement of 1,5-dienes
- It shifts double bonds and molecular framework
- Generally occurs at high temperatures
- Stereospecific process that maintains stereochemistry

2. Analyze the given molecule:
- Bicyclic structure with an azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system
- Contains a vinyl group attached to the nitrogen
- Double bond at position 5

3. Predict Cope rearrangement mecha...
