=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:48:48,266 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams are graphical representations of quantum interactions with specific topological features that relate to the complexity of the calculation.

2) The number of loops in a Feynman diagram directly relates to the power of the quantum coupling constant (in this case, appears to be α or g).

3) Let's count the loop-dependent terms in the given expression:
   - α^3 suggests some power-counting related to loops
   - g^2 suggests...
