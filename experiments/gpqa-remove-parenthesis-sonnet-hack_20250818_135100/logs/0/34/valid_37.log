=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:49:22,316 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's clarify the context:
• We have two point particles
• They are separated by 137 meters
• They experience an attractive and a repulsive force

2. The clue is in the symmetry of the distance (137 meters) and the forces

3. The forces likely refer to fundamental interactions:
• Attractive force = Gravitational force
• Repulsive force = Electromagnetic force between charged particles

4. Key insight: The ratio of these forces is often connected to the n...
