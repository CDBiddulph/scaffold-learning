2025-08-18 21:48:35,042 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant (K) is given as 5x10^10, which is very large, indicating the reaction strongly favors the dissociated state.

3) We start with a 0.02 M stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA complex.

4) We can set up an ICE table:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻
   Initial:  0.02    0       0
   Change:   -x      +x      +x
   Equilibrium: 0.02-x       x  ...
