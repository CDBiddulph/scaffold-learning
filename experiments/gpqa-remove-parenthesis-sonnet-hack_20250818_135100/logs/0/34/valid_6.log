2025-08-18 21:48:31,826 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O):
• This is a molecule with 9 carbon atoms
• Has an aldehyde group at one end of a 3-carbon side chain attached to a benzene ring

2. First reaction with methylmagnesium bromide (Product 1):
• This will add a methyl group (CH3)
• Product 1 will now have 10 carbon atoms
• Likely forms a secondary alcohol

3. Treatment with pyridinium chlorochromate (Product 2):
• This oxidizes the alcohol back to an aldehyde or ketone
• ...
