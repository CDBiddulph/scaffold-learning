2025-08-18 21:48:29,956 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what determines a planet's density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• For a spherical planet, volume depends on radius
• Composition affects the internal structure and compressibility

2. Option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
• This would have the same density as Earth
• Density would be around 5.5 g/cm³

3. Option b (2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ density):
• This suggests a constant density regardless of increased mass
• Unlikely to ...
