2025-08-18 21:48:32,914 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the structure of the starting molecule:
• 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid contains:
- A cyclohexene ring
- A vinyl group
- An aldehyde (formyl) group
- A carboxylic acid group

2. When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, this typically results in:
• Reduction of the aldehyde group to an alcohol
• Reduction of the vinyl group to an alkyl group
• Potential hydrogenation of the cyclohexene ring
• Potential reduction of ...
