=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:48:29,875 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   - Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
   - 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   - We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This scenario follows exponential decay probability principles

3) Key calculation: 
   - If there's a 32% chance of decay in 100 minutes, that means the probability of surviving 100 minutes is 68%

4) We've already survived 50 minutes. ...
