2025-08-18 21:49:08,460 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin in a given direction is calculated by:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y-direction

2) The given spin state is ψ = (3i, 4)

3) σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}

4) Let's multiply σ_y * ψ first:
   \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} * \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
   = \begin{pmatrix} -i*4 \\ i*3i \end{pmatrix}
   = \begi...
