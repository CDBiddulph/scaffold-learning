=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-18 21:49:41,216 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the initial molecule bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
• This is a rigid, bridged bicyclic ketone structure
• Has a carbonyl group at the 2-position

2) UV irradiation with same molecular weight suggests a photochemical reaction
• Most likely a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition
• The carbonyl group likely reacts with another part of the molecule
• This forms a cyclobutane ring, creating a new four-membered ring

3) Palladium/hydrogen treatment sugg...
