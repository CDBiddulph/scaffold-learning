=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:48:51,861 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's analyze the molecular formulas:
• A (C6H13Br): Suggests a bromine-containing alkyl halide
• B (C4H6): Suggests an alkyne
• C (C10H18): Product resulting from A and B reacting

2. Analyzing the NMR signals:
• A has 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets), indicating a branched structure
• B has 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet), suggesting a branched alkyne
• C has 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet), indicating a more complex structure...
