=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:49:27,134 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the scenario:
• We have a light beam in a glass with refractive index n
• The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
• We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer
• Speed of light in vacuum is c = 1

2. This scenario is related to relativistic velocity addition formula.

3. The classical relativistic velocity addition formula is:
u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c²)
Where:
• u is light's speed in glas...
