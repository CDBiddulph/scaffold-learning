=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:49:35,164 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial mixture:
• Volume ratio of (A+B) : C = 1 : 2.25
• A : B = 1 : 1
• Total volume of (A+B) = 1

2) Initial composition:
• A = 0.5
• B = 0.5
• C = 2.25

3) The reaction involves:
• A and B reacting with C
• Producing water and HHal acid
• Density of A and B differs by 2.11

4) Possible reactions require a halogen in C. This suggests halogen-containing molecule.

5) Let's guess C is a halogen molecule (like Cl2):
• A could be a hy...
