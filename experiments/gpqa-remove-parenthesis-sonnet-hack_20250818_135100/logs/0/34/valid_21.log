=== INPUT ===
S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 21:48:57,164 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, S-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine
- This protects the hydroxyl group with a silyl protecting group
- Forms product 1 with a silyl ether

2) Product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide
- Ph2CuLi is an organocuprate reagent that will add a phenyl group
- Benzyl bromide adds a benzyl group
- Forms product 2 with phenyl and benzyl substituents

3) Product 2 i...
