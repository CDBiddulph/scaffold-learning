=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:49:38,763 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the context:
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM) are extensions of the Standard Model
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) characterize quantum corrections to electroweak precision observables
- Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance effects in particle interactions

2. Evaluating Breit-Wigner corrections:
- In MHDM, Breit-Wigner corrections can provide additional information about quantum loop effects
- These corrections depend on the ...
