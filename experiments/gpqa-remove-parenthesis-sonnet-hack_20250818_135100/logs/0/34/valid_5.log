2025-08-18 21:48:37,066 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In elastic scattering, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total reaction cross-section by the optical theorem.

2) The optical theorem states that:
   Im(f(0)) = (k/4π) σ_total
   where k is the wave number and σ_total is the total reaction cross-section.

3) The total reaction cross-section can be calculated from phase shifts using:
   σ_total = (4π/k²) ∑(2l+1)sin²(δ_l)

4) First, let's list the given phase shifts:
   δ_0 ...
