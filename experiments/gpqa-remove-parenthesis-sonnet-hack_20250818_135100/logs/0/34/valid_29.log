Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 21:49:10,091 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, conditions for optical activity:
- Must have a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- Must be a saturated hydrocarbon
- Requires an uneven number of carbon atoms with different substituents

2. Compositional analysis:
- We'll calculate molecular formulae using %age composition and molecular weights

3. Option A (C:H = 83.33:16.66):
- Molecular formula: C6H12
- Symmetric structure, no chiral center
- Not optically active

4. Option B (C:H = 83.72:16.27):
- M...
