2025-08-18 21:48:45,994 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand what SMEFT is:
• SMEFT = Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• This is a framework for describing physics beyond the Standard Model using effective operators

2. Analyze each symmetry:

• Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental to all relativistic field theories
- Describes how physical laws look the same in different reference frames
- MUST be respected by SMEFT operators
- DEFINITELY included

• Poincare Symmetry:
- Combines Lorentz transformation...
