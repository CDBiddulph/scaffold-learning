=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27

2025-08-18 21:48:46,506 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the system configuration:
   - 12 particles with charge 2e are arranged in a circle at 2 m from point P
   - 1 particle with charge 2e is fixed at point P

2) Calculate the Coulomb constant (k):
   k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Calculate charge:
   Each particle has charge Q = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

4) Consider interactions between the 12 particles around the circle:
   - These 12 particles will be equally spaced ar...
