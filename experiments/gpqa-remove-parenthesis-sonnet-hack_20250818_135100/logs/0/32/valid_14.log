=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D 2.822 x 10^-26

1) First, let's understand the system's configuration:
   - 13 total charges
   - 12 charges are 2 meters from point P
   - 1 charge is at point P
   - Each charge is 2...
