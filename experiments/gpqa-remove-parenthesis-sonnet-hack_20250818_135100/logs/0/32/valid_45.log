=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:46:37,460 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Initial conditions:
• Volume ratio of (A+B):C = 1:2.25
• A:B volume ratio = 1:1
• A, B, and C are reagents

2) Since A:B is 1:1, and the total (A+B) volume is 1, thi...
