=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-18 21:46:39,114 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law: λ_max ∝ 1/T
   Here, peak photon energy is inversely proportional to temperature

2) Peak energy for star A: 7.21 eV
   Peak e...
