=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-18 21:45:32,487 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The overall reaction is: Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10, which means:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) Initia...
