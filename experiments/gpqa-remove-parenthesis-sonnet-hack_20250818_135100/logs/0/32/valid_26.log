=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
C 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-18 21:46:04,981 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between angular size θ, horizon radius R, and distance d:
   θ = R/d (in radians)

2) We're given:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 ...
