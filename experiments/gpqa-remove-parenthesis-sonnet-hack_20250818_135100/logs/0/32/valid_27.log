=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

2025-08-18 21:46:10,250 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the general formula for expectation value:
   • <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) Given state vector is (3i, 4)
   • ψ = [3i, 4]

3) Compute σ_y:
   σ_y = \be...
