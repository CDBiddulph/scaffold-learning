An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

1) First, recall the definition of expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y-direction

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]

3) σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

4) Let's calculate σ_y ψ:
   [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]
   = [(-i * 4), (i * 3i)]
   = [-4i, -9]

5) Now calculate ψ† * (σ_y ψ):
   [3i, 4]† * [-4i, -9]
   = (3i * -4i) + (4 * -9)
   = 12 + (-36)
   = -24

6) Calculate final value:
   <S_y> = -24 * (ℏ/2)
   = -12ℏ

7) -12ℏ = -12*ℏ/25 * 25
   = -12*ℏ/25

The answer corresponds to option D.
