=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 21:23:04,252 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relativistic velocity transformation formula for relative motion of a medium.

2) In this scenario:
• Speed of light in vacuum (c) = 1
• Refractive index of glass = n
• Velocity of glass = v (moving toward observer)

3) The relativistic velocity transformation formula in this case is:
(c/n - v) / (1 - v*c/n)

4) Substituting c = 1 and simplifying:
(1/n - v) / (1 - v/n)

5) Algebraically manipulating this:
(1/n - v) / (1 - v/n) = (1 - n*v) / (n - v)

6) This can be rearranged to:
(1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) Checking the answer choices, this exactly matches option D.

8) Let's verify the key points:
• This formula accounts for relativistic effects
• It considers both the refractive index and the medium's motion
• It reduces to expected results at low velocities
• It maintains the principle that no information travels faster than light

9) The physics checks out, so we can confidently select D.
