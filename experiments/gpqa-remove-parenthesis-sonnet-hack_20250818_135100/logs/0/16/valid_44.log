Name reactions in chemistry refer to a specific set of well-known chemical reactions that are typically named after their discoverers or the scientists who made significant contributions to their development. These reactions have had a profound impact on the field of chemistry and are often used as fundamental building blocks in various chemical syntheses.
Identify the reactants for the following name reactions.
A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol

A) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
B) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene
C) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
D A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. First reaction (A + H2SO4 → 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one):
• This looks like an oxidation reaction, specifically converting an alcohol to a ketone
• The reactant A needs to be an alcohol with the same carbon skeleton as the product
• Comparing the structures, this is a dehydration/oxidation of 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol
• H2SO4 acts as a catalyst/dehydrating agent

2. Second reaction (B + BuLi + H+ → 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol):
• This looks like an aldol-type condensation or alkylation
• The reactant B needs to be the corresponding ketone
• Comparing the structures, this is conversion of 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one to the alcohol

3. Checking the options:
• Option A matches both our deductions perfectly
• A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol
• B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one

Therefore, the answer is: 

Answer: A
