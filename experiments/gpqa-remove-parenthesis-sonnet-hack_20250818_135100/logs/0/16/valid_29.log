Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 21:22:46,321 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, for a hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must have:
• An asymmetric carbon center (chiral center)
• At least one carbon with 4 different substituents

2) Let's calculate the molecular formula for each data set using %age composition:
A) C5H12 (pentane)
B) C6H14 (hexane)
C) C4H10 (butane)
D) C7H16 (heptane)

3) For optical activity, we need a carbon with 4 different groups attached

4) In series A-D, only molecules with asymmetric carbon centers will be optically active

5) Specifically, we're looking for a hydrocarbon with a chiral center

6) This occurs in 2-methylbutane (option A) which has a chiral center at the 2nd carbon
• It has the formula C5H12
• Its mass spectrum matches the given m/z values
• It's the only option with an asymmetric carbon

7) The other options represent symmetric hydrocarbons without chiral centers

8) Therefore, the data set corresponding to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon is option A.
