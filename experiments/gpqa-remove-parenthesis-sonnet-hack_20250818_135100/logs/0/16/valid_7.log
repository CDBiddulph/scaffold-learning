=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 21:22:09,881 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall how a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate works:
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit
   • If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped (|0⟩ → |1⟩ and |1⟩ → |0⟩)

2) In this input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

3) The condition is that the first qubit of the control must be in the state |0⟩
   • Here, the first qubit of the control is indeed |0⟩

4) When the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged
   • This means the output state will have the same first part
   • The target qubit remains |0⟩

5) Mathematically, this means:
   U_{C-NOT}|ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

6) This exactly matches option A.

Therefore, the output preserves the original superposition on the first qubit and keeps the target qubit in the |0⟩ state.
