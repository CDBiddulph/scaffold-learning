=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

2025-08-18 21:23:12,174 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Initial volume ratio (A+B):C = 1:2.25
   This means if total volume of A and B is x, volume of C is 2.25x

2) Given that volume ratio of A:B is 1:1
   So if total volume of A and B is x, each is x/2

3) Density of A and B differ by a factor of 2.11

4) Let molar masses be:
   A: m
   B: 2.11m
   C: Let's call this x

5) Since volume of A:B is 1:1, mass of A:B is 1:2.11

6) Let's assume 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B
   Mass of A = m
   Mass of B = 2.11m
   Total mass = 3.11m

7) We know the reaction produces water and HHal acid

8) The stoichiometry suggests these are likely from hydrocarbons and a halogen

9) Mass of HHal acid = Total mass * (mass fraction)

10) From the volume ratios and chemical considerations, this suggests the mass fraction of HHal acid is 35%

The answer is consistent with option C.
