1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
- Higher energy corresponds to shorter wavelength (blue/violet end of spectrum)
- Lower energy corresponds to longer wavelength (red/yellow end of spectrum)

2) The given energy is 2.3393 eV. We need to determine what color would be absorbed by the organic compound.

3) When a compound absorbs light of a specific color, it appears as the complementary color.

4) Let's convert 2.3393 eV to wavelength using the energy-wavelength equation:
- E = hc/λ
- Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is wavelength

5) This energy corresponds to wavelength in the visible spectrum around 530-550 nm.

6) A wavelength around 530-550 nm corresponds to green light.

7) The complementary color to green is magenta/red.

8) Since the question asks what color is absorbed, the answer would be red.

9) Looking at the options, C (Red) matches our reasoning.
