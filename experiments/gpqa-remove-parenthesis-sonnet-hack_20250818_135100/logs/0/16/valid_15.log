=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:22:24,126 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams are used to calculate quantum amplitudes, and the number of loops corresponds to the order of quantum corrections.

2) The key indicator of loop number in computational physics is often found in power-law scaling and dimensional analysis.

3) Let's look at the symbols: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

4) The presence of 1/(4pi)^6 suggests multiple powers of loop-related factors.

5) Specifically, the (4pi)^6 in the denominator implies 3 loops:
   - Each loop typically introduces a factor of 1/(4pi)^2
   - 3 loops would give (1/(4pi)^2)^3 = 1/(4pi)^6

6) The other factors (coupling constants, energy scale ratios) support this loop counting, but the 1/(4pi)^6 is the most direct indicator.

7) Checking our options, 3 loops corresponds to option D.
