=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 21:23:02,629 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. ChIP-seq context:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) and DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) are chemical crosslinking agents
- The antibody targets IKAROS, a key transcription factor in B cell development
- Peaks disappear when switching from PFA to PFA+DSG fixation

2. What does this suggest about the peaks?
- The peaks' disappearance indicates they represent short-range or weak interactions
- These are likely to be dynamic, transient protein-DNA interactions

3. Characteristics of such interactions:
- Often associated with active regulatory regions
- Typically found near gene regulatory elements
- Characterized by rapid protein binding/unbinding

4. Where are such interactions most likely to occur?
- Active promoters and enhancers are known for:
  * Rapid transcription factor binding
  * Dynamic chromatin states
  * Short-lived protein interactions
  * Sensitive to crosslinking conditions

5. Other locations are less likely:
- Random locations: No specific reason for peaks
- Repeats: Generally more stable, less dynamic
- Introns: Less likely to have active regulatory interactions

6. The disappearing peaks strongly suggest active regulatory regions.
