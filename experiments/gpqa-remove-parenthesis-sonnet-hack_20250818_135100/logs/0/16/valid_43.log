=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

2025-08-18 21:23:09,106 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll analyze the requirements:
- We want to clone the sequence into the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS)
- We want directional cloning
- We need to use restriction enzyme sites in the primers

2. Looking at the MCS, I see the following relevant sites:
- HindIII
- KpnI
- BamHI

3. In the given sequence, I want to check where these restriction sites naturally occur or can be added via the primers.

4. Forward primer considerations:
- Starts with the ATG start codon
- Needs an appropriate restriction site at the 5' end
- HindIII or KpnI would work well based on the MCS

5. Reverse primer considerations:
- Must include the stop codon
- Needs a complementary restriction site
- BamHI would fit the MCS well

6. Analyzing the options:
- Option A uses HindIII (5') and KpnI (3')
- Option B uses HindIII (5') and BamHI (3')
- Option C uses SmaI (5') and BamHI (3')
- Option D uses BamHI (5') and HindIII (3')

7. Option B matches our strategic requirements perfectly.

Answer: B
