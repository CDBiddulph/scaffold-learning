=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

2025-08-18 21:22:36,033 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) First, consider the directing effects of substituents:
- Activating groups with ortho/para directing effect: C6H5-CH3, C6H5-C2H5
- Deactivating groups with meta directing effect: C6H5-NO2, C6H5-COOH
- Weakly deactivating groups with para directing effect: C6H5-Cl, C6H5-COOC2H5

2) Para-isomer yield depends on:
- Substituent's electronic effect
- Strength of deactivation/activation
- Steric hindrance

3) Detailed analysis:
- C6H5-NO2 (nitro): Strongly deactivating, meta directing, lowest para yield
- C6H5-COOH (carboxylic acid): Deactivating, meta directing, very low para yield
- C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester): Weakly deactivating, favors para substitution
- C6H5-Cl (chloro): Weakly deactivating, para directing
- C6H5-CH3 (methyl): Strongly activating, ortho/para directing
- C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl): Strongly activating, ortho/para directing

4) Ordering from lowest to highest para-isomer yield:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

This matches option C.
