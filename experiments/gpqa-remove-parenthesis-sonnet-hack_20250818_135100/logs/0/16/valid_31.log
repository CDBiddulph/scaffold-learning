Which of the following sequences is correctly ordered by their distance from the Sun? When a parameter is not mentioned, assume it is zero. For the stars in the Solar Neighborhood (distance < 500 pc), assume that the total absorption in the V band relates to the color excess of the B-V color with an Rv value of 3.1.


a) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magnitude of 8 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
b) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
c) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 9 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
d) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
e) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
f) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magnitude of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag

A) b < d < e < a < c

B) b < a < f < c

C d < b < f < c

D) b < e < c < f

1) First, recall the distance modulus equation:
m - M = 5 log(d/10) + A(V)
Where:
m = observed magnitude
M = absolute magnitude
d = distance in parsecs
A(V) = total absorption in V band

2) A(V) is related to E(B-V) with Rv = 3.1
A(V) = Rv * E(B-V)

3) Let's analyze each option:

a) m = 8, M = 8, E(B-V) = 0
   5 log(d/10) = 0
   d = 10 pc

b) m = 7, M = 8, E(B-V) = 0
   5 log(d/10) = -1
   d = 4 pc

c) m = 9, M = 8, E(B-V) = 0
   5 log(d/10) = 1
   d = 40 pc

d) m = 7, M = 8, E(B-V) = 0.2
   A(V) = 3.1 * 0.2 = 0.62
   5 log(d/10) = -1 - 0.62 = -1.62
   d ≈ 2.5 pc

e) m = 7, M = 7, E(B-V) = 0.2
   A(V) = 3.1 * 0.2 = 0.62
   5 log(d/10) = 0 - 0.62 = -0.62
   d ≈ 5 pc

f) m = 7, M = 7, E(B-V) = 0
   5 log(d/10) = 0
   d = 10 pc

4) Ordering from smallest to largest distance:
   d: b < d < e < a < f < c

5) This matches option A.
