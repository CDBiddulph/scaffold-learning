=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
• Peak energy is proportional to temperature
• If star A peaks at 7.21 eV compared to sun's 1.41 eV, its surface temperature is higher

2) Calculate temperature ratio:
• Temperature ratio = 7.21 eV / 1.41 eV = 5.11

3) Now use Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity = σ * R² * T⁴
• We know star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun
• Let R be star A's radius relative to sun's radius

4) Rearrange luminosity equation:
• (R²) * (T⁴) = 24
• R² * (5.11)⁴ = 24

5) Solve for R:
• R² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
• R² = 24 / 676.4
• R = √(24 / 676.4)
• R = 0.188 (which is closest to 0.19)

6) Check options and select 0.19
