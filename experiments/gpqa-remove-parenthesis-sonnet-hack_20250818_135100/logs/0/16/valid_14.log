2025-08-18 21:22:24,205 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the electrostatic potential energy formula:
   U = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (q1 * q2 / r)
   Where q1 and q2 are charges, r is distance, ε₀ is permittivity of free space

2) Key parameters:
   • Charge of each particle = 2e
   • 12 particles at 2m from point P
   • 13th charge at point P
   • e = elementary charge = 1.6 × 10^-19 C
   • 4πε₀ = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²

3) Charge calculations:
   • Each charge = 2e = 2 * (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C
   • Charge of 13th particle = 3.2 × 10^-19 C
   • Charge of 12 other particles = 12 * 3.2 × 10^-19 = 3.84 × 10^-18 C

4) Energy calculation:
   • Energy with 13th charge at P: 12 * (3.2 × 10^-19)(3.2 × 10^-19) * (8.99 × 10^9) / 2
   • = 12 * (1.024 × 10^-37) * (8.99 × 10^9) / 2
   • = 5.645 × 10^-26 J

5) Checking the options, this matches option C.
