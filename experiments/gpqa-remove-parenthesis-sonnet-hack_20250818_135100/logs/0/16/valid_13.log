2025-08-18 21:22:20,134 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT means:
• SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory
• It's an extension of the Standard Model that incorporates high-energy physics effects

2. Lorentz Symmetry (option 1):
• Fundamental to all modern quantum field theories
• Describes invariance under coordinate transformations
• MUST be respected by SMEFT ✓

3. Poincare Symmetry (option 2):
• Includes Lorentz transformations plus spacetime translations
• A more comprehensive symmetry that also MUST be respected ✓

4. CP Symmetry (option 3):
• Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P)
• Not a fundamental requirement in SMEFT
• Known to be violated in some weak interactions ✗

5. CPT Symmetry (option 4):
• Fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories
• Combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal
• A cornerstone of quantum field theory principles
• MUST be respected by SMEFT ✓

6. Combining the requirements:
• Options 1, 2, and 4 are essential symmetries
• These MUST be respected by SMEFT
