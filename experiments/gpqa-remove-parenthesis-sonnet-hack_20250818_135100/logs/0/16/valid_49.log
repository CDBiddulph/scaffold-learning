1) First, let's understand the starting material bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one:
• This is a bicyclic ketone with a rigid cage-like structure
• It has a ketone group at the 2-position

2) When irradiated with UV radiation, it forms product 1:
• Since the molecular weight is the same, this suggests a photochemical rearrangement
• Most likely, this is a [2+2] photocycloaddition involving the ketone
• This creates a new cyclobutane ring, connecting the ketone's carbonyl carbon to another part of the molecule

3) When product 1 is hydrogenated with Pd/C and H2:
• This will reduce any unsaturation in the molecule
• The new cyclobutane ring will be converted to a saturated four-membered ring
• All carbons will become sp3 hybridized

4) In the final product 2:
• The structure is fully saturated
• Hydrogens will be in different chemical environments

5) For the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus:
• This would likely be near the former ketone position
• Its splitting pattern depends on neighboring hydrogens
• A singlet suggests no neighboring hydrogens
