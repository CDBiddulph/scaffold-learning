=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's identify the forces at play:
• Electric force (potentially repulsive or attractive)
• Gravitational force (always attractive)

2) The fundamental forces follow different distance dependence:
• Electric force: 1/r²
• Gravitational force: 1/r²

3) The key insight is the magnitudes of these forces:
• Electric force between elementary charges is enormously stronger than gravitational force
• At atomic scales, electric force dominates by ~10^36 times

4) The problem specifies:
• Two point particles
• Separated by 137 meters
• One attractive, one repulsive force
• This strongly suggests we're comparing fundamental forces

5) Given the specific distance of 137 meters and the forces' characteristics, this sounds like a reference to fundamental physical constants

6) 137 is very close to the fine structure constant (α ≈ 1/137), which characterizes electromagnetic interaction strength

7) The ratio of forces would likely relate to this fundamental constant

8) Looking at the options, 1/137 seems most consistent with the physical reasoning
