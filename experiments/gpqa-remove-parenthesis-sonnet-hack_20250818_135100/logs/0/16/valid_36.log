=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:22:58,378 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Key information from the problem:
- Satellites detect astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Localization precision considerations:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests the objects are likely at significant distances
- Close objects would require much more precise localization

3. Evaluating the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
   - These are extremely large cosmic scales
   - Consistent with large angular uncertainty
   - Matches astronomical object detection at galactic/extragalactic distances

B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years
   - These are within our galaxy
   - Plausible, but smaller scale than A

C) 10 or 100 light years
   - Very close, within our solar neighborhood
   - Too local for typical satellite astronomical surveys
   - Would require much higher precision

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - These are very short distances
   - Within our solar system
   - Not consistent with astronomical object detection

4. Conclusion:
Option A provides the most scientifically reasonable set of distances for astronomical object detection with low precision localization.
