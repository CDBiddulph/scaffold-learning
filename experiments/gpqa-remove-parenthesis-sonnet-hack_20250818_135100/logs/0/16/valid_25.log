=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 21:22:40,014 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the conditions:
- The particle is confined between an inner sphere (radius d1) and an outer sphere (radius 100*d1)
- The wave function is time-independent and spherically symmetric
- The wave function has no imaginary part
- The probability of finding the particle between d1 and 2*d1 is equal to the probability between 2*d1 and 3*d1

2) For a spherically symmetric wave function, the probability of finding the particle depends on:
- The volume of the spherical shell
- The wave function's form

3) The volume of a spherical shell from radius r1 to r2 is proportional to (r2³ - r1³)

4) Since the probabilities are equal, the wave function must compensate for the changing shell volumes

5) Let's consider the shell volumes:
- First shell (d1 to 2*d1): Volume ∝ (2*d1)³ - (d1)³
- Second shell (2*d1 to 3*d1): Volume ∝ (3*d1)³ - (2*d1)³

6) For equal probabilities, the wave function must scale as 1/r²

7) Specifically, Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r²
