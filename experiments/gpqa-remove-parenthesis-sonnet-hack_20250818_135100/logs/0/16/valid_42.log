=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:23:08,276 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Current Experimental Conditions:
- Temperature: 300°C
- The student has already tried varying catalyst amount and composition
- Current conversion is not improving

2. Understanding Reaction Dynamics:
- This is a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction
- Conversion depends on multiple factors: temperature, catalyst, reaction kinetics

3. Temperature Effects:
- Typically, increasing temperature increases reaction rate and conversion
- However, the student is advised to DECREASE temperature (20-40°C)
- This suggests the reaction might be experiencing:
   a) Potential catalyst deactivation at high temperatures
   b) Possible side reactions or undesired polymerization

4. Catalyst Considerations:
- The professor suggests increasing catalyst amount
- This could improve reaction efficiency and conversion

5. Polymerization Warning:
- The advice includes a caution about potential polymerization
- This indicates a risk of unwanted side reactions at certain conditions

6. Recommendation Analysis:
- Option A: Giving up is inappropriate
- Option B: Lacks polymerization warning
- Option C: Addresses temperature reduction, catalyst increase, AND polymerization risk
- Option D: Contradicts recommended approach by increasing temperature

Reasoning points toward Option C as the most scientifically sound advice.
