1. First, recall the relationship between mass, volume, and density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• Density depends on both mass and volume

2. Option a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:
• Same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)
• No change in density

3. Option b) 2 Earth masses, density of 5.5 g/cm³:
• Mass is increased, but density remains constant
• Interesting, but not the highest density

4. Option c) Same composition as Earth, 5 times more massive:
• If volume doesn't increase proportionally, density will increase
• Increased mass will compress the planet more
• Gravitational compression will increase density beyond 5.5 g/cm³
• Most likely to have the highest density

5. Option d) Same composition, half Earth's mass:
• Reduced mass means less gravitational compression
• Lower density than standard Earth density

6. The key insight is gravitational compression: more massive planets experience more internal compression, increasing density.

Option c represents a planet with significantly higher mass that would experience substantial gravitational compression, leading to the highest density.
