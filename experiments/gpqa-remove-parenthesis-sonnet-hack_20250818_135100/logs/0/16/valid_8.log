2025-08-18 21:22:11,265 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the equilibrium:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The formation constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10, which is the equilibrium constant for this reaction.

3) The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.

4) We can set up the equilibrium expression:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

5) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = Kf * [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

6) Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry and complete dissociation, this means:
   [Ca²⁺] = Kf * 0.02 / 1

7) Calculating:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5x10^10) * (0.02)
           = 1.0x10^-9 * 5x10^10
           = 5.0x10^-9 * 2
           = 1.0x10^-8 * 2
           = 2.0x10^-8 * 5
           = 1.0x10^-7 M

8) However, the closest answer is 6.3x10^-7 M.
