=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:22:56,726 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Hi-C Observation:
- Detected a significant interaction between a promoter and enhancer
- Separated by ~1 Mb linear distance
- Based on 50M cells, suggesting a robust statistical signal

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not confirm the interaction detected by Hi-C
- This suggests potential discrepancy in interaction detection

3. Functional Validation:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This indicates a functional interaction between the enhancer and promoter

4. Possible Explanations:
A) Low interaction frequency: Unlikely, as Hi-C was done with 50M cells, providing high statistical power
B) Structural variation: Possible explanation for discrepancy between techniques
C) Linear interaction too short: Incorrect, as 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH
D) False-positive Hi-C signal: Possible, but functional validation suggests a real interaction

5. Reasoning:
- The functional validation by dCas9-KRAB suggests a real interaction
- Structural variations could cause differences in interaction detection between Hi-C and FISH
- Structural variations can lead to different spatial conformations not captured by linear distance measurements

Based on this analysis, the most likely explanation is structural variation affecting interaction detection.
