=== INPUT ===
In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
C One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:23:18,184 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. First, let's understand the goal:
- Create a branched polyethylene using only ethylene
- Use a dual catalyst system
- Introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone

2. Examining the senior scientist's statements:

A) "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US."
- This sounds like a specific claim that would require verification
- Industrial implementation of dual catalyst branching systems is plausible

B) "Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step."
- This is a specific technical claim about catalyst activation
- The statement suggests a limitation of aluminum-based activators

C) "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators."
- Group VIa transition metals include chromium, molybdenum, tungsten
- These metals have been used in polymerization catalysis
- The statement seems technically sound

D) "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive."
- Noble metal catalysts are often expensive
- But the statement implies their technical feasibility
- Cost is a practical, not scientific, limitation

3. Analyzing scientific credibility:
- Statement C provides the most technically precise and scientifically relevant information about the catalyst system
- It describes a specific type of catalyst (group VIa transition metal) and suggests a viable approach

4. Cross-checking scientific principles:
- Group VIa transition metals are known for their catalytic properties
- Combining specific metal catalysts can indeed modify polymer structure

Therefore, the most scientifically accurate statement is C.
