1) First, recall the relationship between angular size θ, diameter D, and distance d:
   θ (in radians) = D / d

2) We know:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   Convert to radians: θ = 10^-17 * (π/180) ≈ 10^-19 radians
   d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Rearrange to find diameter D:
   D = θ * d = 10^-19 * 10^10 = 10^-9 parsecs

4) Convert to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   D ≈ 10^-9 * 3 * 10^16 = 3 * 10^7 meters

5) This diameter is the event horizon diameter of the black hole

6) The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon area
   S = kA/4l^2, where k is Boltzmann's constant and l is Planck length

7) Area of event horizon = πr^2
   Radius = D/2 = 1.5 * 10^7 meters

8) Area ≈ π * (1.5 * 10^7)^2 ≈ 10^15 m^2

9) Entropy is proportional to this area
   Order of magnitude ≈ 10^62 J/K

10) This corresponds to option C.
