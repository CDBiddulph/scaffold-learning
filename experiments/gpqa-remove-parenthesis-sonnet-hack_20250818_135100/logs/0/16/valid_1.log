A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

1) First, let's calculate the decay constant and half-life of Caesium-137:
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
- Decay constant λ = ln(2) / (half-life)
- λ ≈ 0.693 / (30 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 7 × 10^-10 per second

2) Number of decays per second:
- Total atoms = 10^17
- Decay rate = Number of atoms * decay constant
- Decay rate ≈ 10^17 * 7 × 10^-10 = 7 × 10^7 decays/second

3) Total decays in 80 minutes:
- 80 minutes = 4800 seconds
- Total decays = (7 × 10^7) * 4800 ≈ 3.36 × 10^11 decays

4) Detector solid angle calculation:
- Detector area = 2 * 3 = 6 cm²
- Distance = 4 meters = 400 cm
- Solid angle ≈ (6 / (400)²) = 3.75 × 10^-4 steradians

5) Detected gamma-rays:
- Total decays * solid angle ≈ 3.36 × 10^11 * 3.75 × 10^-4
- ≈ 1.26 × 10^8 gamma-rays

This is closest to option B: 100 million (10^8).
