=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's recall the equilibrium temperature (Teq) equation:
   Teq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) * R^(-1/2)
   Where A is albedo, R is orbital distance

2) We know the albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets, so we can simplify:
   Teq ∝ R^(-1/2)

3) From the temperature ratios:
   Teq(Planet1)/Teq(Planet2) = 1.4
   This implies R(Planet2)/R(Planet1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96

4) Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3:
   Teq(Planet2)/Teq(Planet3) = 2.3
   This implies R(Planet3)/R(Planet2) = (2.3)^2 = 5.29

5) Orbital period (P) is related to orbital radius (R) by Kepler's third law:
   P^2 ∝ R^3

6) So the orbital period ratio will be the cube root of the radius ratio

7) R(Planet3)/R(Planet1) = 1.96 * 5.29 = 10.37

8) (P(Planet3)/P(Planet1))^2 = 10.37
   P(Planet3)/P(Planet1) = √10.37 ≈ 3.22
