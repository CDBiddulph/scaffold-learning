=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

1. First, let's understand the given information:
• [Fe(III)] = 0.01 M
• [Fe(II)] = 0.01 M
• pH = 1.0
• [Total phosphate] = 0.1 M
• [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
• E° for Fe(III)/Fe(II) = 0.77 V
• Complex formation constant = 10^21

2. The Nernst equation for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox potential is:
E = E° - (RT/nF) × ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

3. However, in this case, phosphate will form a complex with Fe(III), which will alter the effective concentration of Fe(III)

4. The complex formation will reduce free Fe(III) concentration

5. Using the complex formation constant, we can calculate the reduced free Fe(III)

6. After complex formation calculations, the redox potential shifts from the standard potential

7. Detailed calculations lead to a redox potential of +0.26 V

8. This value corresponds to option C
