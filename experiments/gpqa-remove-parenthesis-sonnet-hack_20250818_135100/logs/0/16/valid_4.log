=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

1) First, let's understand the given information:
• The decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes
• 50 minutes have already passed without decay
• We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a problem involving exponential decay probability

3) Let's calculate the probability of survival after 50 minutes:
• If the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, then the survival probability is 68% in 100 minutes
• We want to know the survival probability for another 150 minutes

4) We can use the complementary probability method:
• First, calculate the probability it survives an additional 150 minutes
• Then subtract this from 1 to get the decay probability

5) Probability of survival is exponential: (initial survival probability)^(new time/initial time)
• Initial survival probability = 0.68
• Initial time = 100 minutes
• New time = 150 minutes

6) Survival probability = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.52

7) Decay probability = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48 = 48%

8) Checking the options, 48% corresponds to option A.
