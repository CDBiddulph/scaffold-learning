=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.
