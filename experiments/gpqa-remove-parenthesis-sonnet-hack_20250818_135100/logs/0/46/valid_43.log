=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 22:08:51,079 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, analyze the multiple cloning site (MCS) in the expression vector:
- Contains HindIII and BamHI sites
- These will be used for directional cloning

2. Examine the primer requirements:
- Need to flank the entire gene sequence
- Must contain restriction enzyme recognition sites
- 5' primer should have HindIII site
- 3' primer should have BamHI site

3. Check the primer sequences:
- 5' primer should start with HindIII sequence (AAGCTT)
- Forward primer needs to start with AAGCTT before the gene start
- 3' primer should start with BamHI sequence (GGATCC)
- Reverse primer needs to have GGATCC before the reverse complement of the gene end

4. Looking at the options:
- Option A uses HindIII and KpnI - incorrect
- Option B uses HindIII and BamHI - matches requirements
- Option C uses SmaI and BamHI - incorrect
- Option D uses BamHI and HindIII in wrong order

5. Option B meets all the cloning strategy requirements.

Answer: B'
