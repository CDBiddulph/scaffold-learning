=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
B The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:10,264 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the key requirements for the Mott-Gurney equation:
- It describes space-charge-limited current (SCLC)
- Applies to a single-carrier device
- Requires specific boundary conditions

2) Key characteristics of the equation:
- Assumes charge carriers are injected without significant barriers
- Assumes negligible carrier-carrier interactions
- Requires a trap-free semiconductor

3) Let's analyze each option:
A) Requires Ohmic contact - this is not a requirement of the equation
B) Requires no carrier injection barrier ✓
   Assumes a trap-free single-carrier device ✓
   Negligible diffusion current ✓
C) Schottky contact would introduce injection barriers, violating the equation's assumptions
D) Two-carrier device would complicate the current mechanism, invalidating the single-carrier assumption

4) The key requirements are:
- Single-carrier device
- No injection barrier
- Negligible diffusion current

5) This precisely matches option B.
