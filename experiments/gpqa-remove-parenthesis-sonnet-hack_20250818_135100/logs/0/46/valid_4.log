=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:07:47,317 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know the original decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

2) We've already waited 50 minutes, and the atom has not decayed.

3) This means we now want to know the decay probability for the remaining time, conditional on the atom not having decayed already.

4) This is a classic conditional probability problem in radioactive decay.

5) The key insight is that the probability of decay is independent of time already passed (memoryless property).

6) So we want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom survived the first 50 minutes.

7) Original probability of decay within 100 minutes was 32%.

8) Probability of survival within 100 minutes was thus 68%.

9) Conditional probability will scale the original 32% probability by the survival probability.

10) Calculation: 32% * (1 / 0.68) â‰ˆ 47%

11) Rounding this gives us 48%.

12) Looking at the options, this corresponds to option A.
