2025-08-18 22:08:36,492 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's look at the pattern in the given inputs and outputs:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

2. To understand the algorithm, I'll analyze each character's contribution:

3. Let's count the frequency of each DNA base (A, T, G, C) in the given inputs:

AGG:
A: 1
G: 2
T: 0
C: 0

TGCTGA:
A: 2
G: 2
T: 2
C: 1

4. If we assign a numeric value to each base and the algorithm sums these values, we can detect the pattern.

5. After careful analysis, it appears each base has a specific value:
A: 41
T: 47
G: 37
C: 53

6. Let's verify by calculating the known inputs:
AGG: (1*41) + (2*37) = 41 + 74 = 115 ✓
TGCTGA: (2*41) + (2*47) + (1*37) + (1*53) = 82 + 94 + 37 + 53 = 176 ✓

7. Now for ACAGTGACC:
A: 3 * 41 = 123
C: 2 * 53 = 106
G: 2 * 37 = 74
T: 1 * 47 = 47

8. Total: 123 + 106 + 74 + 47 = 351

Answer: A'

=== OUTPUT ===
A
