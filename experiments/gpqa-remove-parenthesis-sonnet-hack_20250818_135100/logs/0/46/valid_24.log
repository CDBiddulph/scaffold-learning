=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:19,439 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, calculate the distance each particle travels in 1e-5s:
- Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 28,800m
- Eta (0.9c): 0.9 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 27,000m
- Chi (0.88c): 0.88 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 26,400m
- Lambda (0.93c): 0.93 * 3e8 * 1e-5 = 27,900m

2) Compare each particle's distance traveled to the ground level of 13,000m:
- Zeta will travel beyond the ground (28,800m)
- Eta will fall short of the ground (27,000m)
- Chi will fall short of the ground (26,400m)
- Lambda will fall short of the ground (27,900m)

3) By decreasing order of particles reaching the ground:
Zeta > Lambda > Eta > Chi

4) This matches option B.
