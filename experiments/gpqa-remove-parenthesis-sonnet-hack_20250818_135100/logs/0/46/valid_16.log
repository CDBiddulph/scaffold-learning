=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 22:08:08,580 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scenario involves a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing experiment in a fertilized egg leading to a transgenic animal.

2. The key observation is that different cell lineages have different genomes, suggesting mosaic genetic modification.

3. Analyzing the options:
- Option A involves converting messenger RNA to cDNA, which is not a typical mechanism for genetic modification
- Option B suggests complex incorporation, but is not the most likely explanation
- Option C involves DNA transfer from the surrogate mother, which is extremely unlikely
- Option D describes the most probable mechanism

4. Mechanism breakdown for Option D:
- Cas9 protein continues to be active during early embryonic cell divisions
- Each cell division provides an opportunity for the donor DNA to be incorporated
- Continuous DNA cutting means some cells get modified while others do not
- This leads to a mosaic genome where different cell lineages have different genetic compositions

5. This phenomenon is known as "mosaicism" in gene editing, where not all cells of an organism are genetically identical due to timing and efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9 modification.

6. Option D best explains the observation of different genomes in different cell lineages.
