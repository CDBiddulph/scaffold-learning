=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:56,843 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let me break this down systematically:

1) Multi-Higgs-doublet models are extensions of the Standard Model that introduce additional Higgs bosons.

2) Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) are quantum corrections that provide a model-independent way to constrain New Physics.

3) Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance phenomena in particle physics, specifically how particles' width and mass interact.

4) In these models, charged scalar masses play a critical role in determining quantum corrections.

5) The introduction of Breit-Wigner corrections can indeed provide more nuanced constraints on New Physics compared to the original parameters.

6) The dependence on charged scalar masses suggests that the constraint's effectiveness is mass-dependent.

7) This implies that while Breit-Wigner corrections provide additional information, their impact varies based on specific model parameters.

8) The statement "it depends on the masses of the charged scalars" captures this critical point precisely.

This systematic analysis suggests that the most accurate response is that the effectiveness of these corrections depends on the specific masses of the charged scalars.
