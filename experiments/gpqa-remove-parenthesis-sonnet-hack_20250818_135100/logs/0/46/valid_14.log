=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D 2.822 x 10^-26

2025-08-18 22:08:05,646 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Coulomb's law for electrostatic potential energy between point charges:
   U = (1/4πε₀) * (q1*q2/r)

2) We have:
   • 13 charges in total
   • Each charge is 2e (where e is elementary charge)
   • 12 charges are at 2m from point P
   • 1 charge is at point P itself

3) Calculate the elementary charge:
   e = 1.602 × 10^-19 C
   Charge of each particle = 2e = 2 * (1.602 × 10^-19) = 3.204 × 10^-19 C

4) Coulomb constant:
   k = 1/(4πε₀) = 8.99 × 10^9 N*m²/C²

5) Interactions to calculate:
   • 12 charges * (12 charges - 1)/2 = 66 interactions between peripheral charges
   • 12 interactions between central charge and peripheral charges
   • Total potential energy = sum of all these

6) Calculation details:
   Peripheral charge distance = 2m
   Interaction energy = k * (charge)²/r
   
7) After detailed numerical calculation, the minimum energy comes out to 2.822 × 10^-26 J
