=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:49,641 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1. Current experimental conditions:
- Temperature: 300°C
- Reaction: Heterogeneously catalyzed hydrocarbon conversion
- Problem: Low reactant conversion per pass

2. Thermodynamic considerations:
- Typically, decreasing temperature reduces reaction rate and conversion
- Increasing temperature usually increases reaction rate and conversion
- However, lower temperatures can sometimes improve selectivity

3. Catalyst considerations:
- Student already tried varying catalyst amount/composition without success
- Simply adding more catalyst won't necessarily improve conversion

4. Critical warning:
- The professor's guidance suggests being aware of potential polymerization
- This means temperature changes could trigger unwanted side reactions

5. Analysis of options:
- Option A: Unacceptable - gives up without exploring solutions
- Option B: Incomplete - doesn't address polymerization risk
- Option C: Most comprehensive - considers:
  * Temperature reduction
  * Catalyst amount increase
  * Awareness of potential polymerization
- Option D: Counterproductive - increasing temperature might cause polymerization

6. Recommendation alignment:
- Option C provides the most scientifically sound approach
- Considers multiple variables
- Highlights potential risks
- Maintains experimental rigor
