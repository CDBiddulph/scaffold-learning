=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:06,909 [INFO] Direct response: 'To solve this, I'll analyze the key elements systematically:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagram loop complexity is typically correlated with the power of loop-related mathematical terms.

2) The given expression contains several key components:
- α^3 (potentially indicating loop power)
- g^2 (coupling constant term)
- 1/(4π)^6 (suggests higher-order loop contribution)

3) The (4π)^6 term is particularly telling. In standard loop calculations, each loop typically introduces a factor of 1/(4π)^2.

4) Here, we see (1/(4π)^6), which suggests 3 loops:
- 1/(4π)^2 would indicate 1 loop
- 1/(4π)^4 would indicate 2 loops
- 1/(4π)^6 indicates 3 loops

5) The energy scale ratio (Q/M)^2 further supports this loop counting method.

6) The power structure of the entire expression is most consistent with a 3-loop diagram.

Therefore, by carefully analyzing the mathematical structure and loop scaling factors, the most likely number of loops is 3.
