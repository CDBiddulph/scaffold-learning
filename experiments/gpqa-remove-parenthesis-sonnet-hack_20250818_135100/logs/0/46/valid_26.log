2025-08-18 22:08:23,621 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = kA/4l_p^2
   where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the event horizon area, l_p is Planck length

2) Angular size θ is related to the black hole's radius R by:
   θ = R/d
   Where d is the distance

3) Rearranging: R = θ * d
   R = 10^-17 * 10^10 parsecs
   R = 10^-7 parsecs

4) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec ≈ 3 * 10^16 meters
   R ≈ 10^-7 * 3 * 10^16 = 3 * 10^9 meters

5) Black hole surface area:
   A = 4πR^2
   A ≈ 4π * (3 * 10^9)^2 ≈ 10^20 m^2

6) Substituting in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:
   S ≈ 10^-23 * (10^20) / (10^-35)^2
   S ≈ 10^62 J/K
