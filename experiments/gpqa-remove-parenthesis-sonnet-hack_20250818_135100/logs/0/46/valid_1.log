=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:07:44,721 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the half-life of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years (about 15.7 million minutes)

2) Calculate decay constant λ:
• λ = ln(2) / half-life = 0.693 / (15.7 × 10^6) ≈ 4.4 × 10^-8 per minute

3) Number of decays per minute:
• Total atoms = 10^17
• Decay rate = 10^17 × λ ≈ 4.4 × 10^9 decays/minute

4) Gamma ray emission:
• Each decay typically produces 1-2 gamma rays
• Let's assume 1.5 gamma rays per decay
• Gamma ray emission rate ≈ 4.4 × 10^9 × 1.5 ≈ 6.6 × 10^9 gamma rays/minute

5) Total gamma rays in 80 minutes:
• 6.6 × 10^9 × 80 ≈ 5.3 × 10^11 total gamma rays

6) Detector solid angle and efficiency:
• Small detector (2×3 cm) at 4m distance will capture a tiny fraction
• Estimated detection: around 10^6 gamma rays

The answer matches option C: 1 million (10^6).
