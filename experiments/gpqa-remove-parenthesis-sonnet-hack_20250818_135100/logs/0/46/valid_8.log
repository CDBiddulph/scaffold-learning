2025-08-18 22:07:51,757 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, let's recall the equilibrium constant expression for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   KCa-EDTA = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA2-]

2) We know the initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

3) At equilibrium, let x be the concentration of free Ca2+ ions:
   [Ca2+] = x
   [EDTA4-] = x
   [Ca-EDTA2-] = 0.02 - x

4) Substituting into the equilibrium constant expression:
   5x10^10 = x^2 / (0.02 - x)

5) Since KCa-EDTA is very large, x will be very small compared to 0.02

6) We can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02

7) Rearranging the equation:
   x^2 = 5x10^10 * 0.02
   x = √(5x10^10 * 0.02)
   x = 6.3x10^-7 M

8) This matches option B
