=== INPUT ===
S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 22:08:14,159 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (S to 1):
- TBS chloride with triethylamine will protect the hydroxyl group with a silyl ether
- Converts the hydroxyl to a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether

2) Second reaction (1 to 2):
- Ph2CuLi is a soft nucleophile that will add a phenyl group
- Benzyl bromide will alkylate the copper reagent
- This introduces a benzyl group at the enolate position

3) Third reaction (2 to 3):
- LDA creates an enolate
- Iodomethane alkylates the enolate
- Adds a methyl group, creating a new stereocenter

4) Final reaction (3 to 4):
- Aqueous HCl removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the original hydroxyl group

By carefully tracking the stereochemistry through these transformations and considering the stereochemical outcomes of each step, the structure matches:

(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
