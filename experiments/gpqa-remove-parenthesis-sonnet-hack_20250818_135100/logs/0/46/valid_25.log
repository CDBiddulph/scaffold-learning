=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 22:08:21,701 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) The wave function is:
- Time independent
- Spherically symmetric
- Has zero imaginary part
- Depends only on distance r from center

2) The problem gives us a key constraint: The probability of finding the particle is equal (P) in two different radial shells:
- First shell: between d1 and 2*d1
- Second shell: between 2*d1 and 3*d1

3) Probability is proportional to |Ψ(r)|^2 * 4πr^2 dr
(4πr^2 dr represents the volume of a spherical shell)

4) For probabilities to be equal in these shells, the wave function must vary such that |Ψ(r)|^2 * r^2 is constant

5) This means |Ψ(r)| must vary as 1/r to make |Ψ(r)|^2 * r^2 constant

6) Therefore, the wave function Ψ(r) must have the form 1/r

7) This corresponds to option A: 1/r
