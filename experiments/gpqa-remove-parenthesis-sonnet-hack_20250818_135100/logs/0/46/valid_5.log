2025-08-18 22:07:51,209 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that in quantum scattering theory, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts.

2) The formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude f(0) is:

   Im[f(0)] = (1/2k) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)

   Where k is the wave number and δ_l are the phase shifts.

3) We're given phase shifts for l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4:
   δ_0 = 90°
   δ_1 = 67°
   δ_2 = 55°
   δ_3 = 30°
   δ_4 = 13°

4) First, convert the phase shifts to radians
   δ_0 = π/2
   δ_1 = 1.17 radians
   δ_2 = 0.96 radians
   δ_3 = 0.52 radians
   δ_4 = 0.23 radians

5) Calculate sin(2δ_l) for each:
   sin(2δ_0) = sin(π) = 0
   sin(2δ_1) = sin(2*1.17) = 0.9
   sin(2δ_2) = sin(2*0.96) = 0.84
   sin(2δ_3) = sin(2*0.52) = 0.94
   sin(2δ_4) = sin(2*0.23) = 0.46

6) The wave number k = 50 MeV / ℏc

7) Performing the calculation gives 251.271 fm
