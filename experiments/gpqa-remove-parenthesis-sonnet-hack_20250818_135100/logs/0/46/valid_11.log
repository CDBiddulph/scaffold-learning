=== INPUT ===
All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:07:58,085 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let me analyze this step-by-step:

1. Statement A about frameshifting:
- Discusses pseudoknot conformations
- Suggests correlation between frameshifting rate and conformations
- Compares SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknots
- Appears scientifically sound

2. Statement B about nsp10/nsp14-ExoN:
- Describes heterodimer formation
- Explains exonuclease complex mechanism
- Suggests prevention of dsRNA breakdown
- Appears scientifically accurate

3. Statement C about ORF3a and apoptosis:
- Discusses caspase-8 activation
- Notes lack of effect on Bcl-2 expression
- Suggests extrinsic apoptotic pathway
- Appears consistent with current research

4. Statement D about programmed ribosomal frameshifting:
- Claims SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting has "mostly the same conformation" as SARS-CoV
- This is potentially problematic
- Recent research suggests subtle but important differences in frameshifting mechanisms between these coronaviruses

After careful analysis, the statement most likely to be incorrect is Statement D.

Answer: D'
