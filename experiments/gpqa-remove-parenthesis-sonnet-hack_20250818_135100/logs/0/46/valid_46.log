2025-08-18 22:08:55,313 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) We'll use Wien's displacement law, which relates peak photon energy to temperature:
T ∝ (Peak Energy)

2) For star A, peak energy = 7.21 eV
For the sun, peak energy = 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) We know star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun.

5) Luminosity relates to radius and temperature as: L ∝ R²T⁴

6) Let's set up the luminosity equation:
24 = (R/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴

7) Rearranging:
(R/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴

8) Taking square root:
R/R_sun = √[24 / (5.11)⁴]

9) Calculating this gives approximately 0.17

10) Checking the options, 0.17 corresponds to option D.

Therefore, the radius of star A is about 0.17 times the sun's radius.
