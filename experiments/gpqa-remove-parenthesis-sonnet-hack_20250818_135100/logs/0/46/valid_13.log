2025-08-18 22:08:02,514 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this systematically:

1. SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is a framework that describes fundamental particle interactions.

2. Lorentz Symmetry (1): This is a fundamental symmetry in relativistic quantum field theories. It describes how physical laws are invariant under coordinate transformations. SMEFT must respect this.

3. Poincare Symmetry (2): This includes both Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. It's a core symmetry in relativistic theories. SMEFT must respect this as well.

4. CP Symmetry (3): Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations. While important in particle physics, it's not a universal requirement for SMEFT operators.

5. CPT Symmetry (4): A fundamental symmetry that combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). This is a very fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories.

6. Checking the requirements for SMEFT operators reveals that Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are mandatory, and CPT symmetry is also essential.

7. This matches option A: 1, 2, 4.
