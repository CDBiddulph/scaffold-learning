=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:40,767 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the context:
- Low Earth orbit satellites are detecting astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Arc minutes refer to angular resolution. At larger distances, the same absolute area covers a smaller angular area.

3. Let's consider the scale of distances in the options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years = extremely large intergalactic distances
B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years = galactic/extragalactic scale
C) 10 or 100 light years = nearby stellar neighborhood
D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds = within solar system scale

4. With localization precision of 100-200 arc minutes, we need a distance where this resolution is meaningful.

5. Option D (10 light minutes/100 light seconds) is far too small and within our solar system.

6. Option A (millions/billions of light years) would make 100-200 arc minute resolution essentially useless.

7. Option C (10-100 light years) is too close to provide meaningful wide-field observation.

8. Option B (1,000-100,000 light years) perfectly matches the scale where such resolution would be scientifically useful - the galactic/nearby extragalactic scale.
