=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 22:08:28,085 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1. An optically active hydrocarbon requires:
- An asymmetric carbon center (chiral carbon)
- A saturated hydrocarbon structure

2. Analysis of elemental composition:
- All given compositions are close to C:H ratio of 5:2
- This suggests alkane or cycloalkane structures

3. Examining EI-MS (Electron Impact Mass Spectrometry) fragmentation:
- m/z values indicate molecular fragmentation patterns
- Lower m/z values suggest smaller hydrocarbons

4. Checking for chirality potential:
- A chiral carbon requires 4 different substituents
- Need at least one asymmetric carbon center

5. Analyzing each option:
- A: m/z = 72 suggests C5H12 (pentane) - symmetrical
- B: m/z = 86 suggests C6H14 (hexane) - symmetrical
- C: m/z = 58 suggests smaller/different structure
- D: m/z = 100 suggests potential branched structure with asymmetric carbon

6. Option D looks most promising for a chiral structure (potential methylpentane isomer)
