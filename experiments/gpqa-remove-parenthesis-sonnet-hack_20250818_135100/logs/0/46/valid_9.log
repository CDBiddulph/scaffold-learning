2025-08-18 22:07:52,568 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand the starting molecule:
• 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid
• Contains a cyclohexene ring
• Has a formyl group (-CHO)
• Has a vinyl group (C=C)
• Has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

2) The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI:
• This typically reduces functional groups
• HI will break double bonds and remove oxygen-containing groups
• Red phosphorus acts as a catalyst

3) After reduction, the molecule will:
• Reduce the double bond in the ring
• Remove the formyl group
• Remove the carboxylic acid group
• Replace with hydrogens

4) Index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) measures the number of rings and double bonds
• Original molecule has 1 ring and 2 double bonds (IHD = 3)
• After complete reduction, no rings or double bonds remain
• IHD becomes 0

5) Checking the answer choices, 0 corresponds to option B

Answer: B'
