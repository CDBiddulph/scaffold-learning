=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:17,036 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) First, let's categorize the substituents:
- Electron-donating groups (EDG): -CH3, -C2H5
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG): -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5, -Cl

2) EDG activate the ring and direct substitution to ortho and para positions
- More para product for -CH3 and -C2H5

3) EWG deactivate the ring and direct substitution to meta position
- Less para product for -NO2, -COOH, -COOC2H5, -Cl

4) Strength of directing effect increases as follows:
- Weak EDG: -CH3, -C2H5
- Weak EWG: -Cl
- Strong EWG: -COOH, -COOC2H5
- Very strong EWG: -NO2

5) By increasing para-isomer yield, the order would be:
-NO2 (least) → -COOH → -COOC2H5 → -Cl → -CH3 → -C2H5 (most)

This corresponds to answer choice B.
