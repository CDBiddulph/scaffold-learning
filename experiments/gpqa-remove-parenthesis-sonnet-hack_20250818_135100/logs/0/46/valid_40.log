=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 22:08:46,543 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the principles of light propagation and reference frames:
- We need to use relativistic velocity addition formula
- The speed of light in glass depends on both the glass's refractive index and its motion
- We're given speed of light in vacuum c=1

2) The relativistic velocity addition formula is:
u' = (u - v) / (1 - u*v/cÂ²)
Where u is the speed in the moving frame, v is the frame's velocity, u' is the speed in the lab frame

3) In this case:
- u = 1/n (speed of light in glass)
- v is the glass's velocity
- c = 1

4) Substituting and simplifying:
u' = [(1/n) - v] / [1 - (1/n)*v]

5) After algebraic manipulation, this reduces to:
u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

6) Checking the given options, this matches option D exactly.

7) This formula accounts for both the refractive index and the motion of the glass.
