\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

2025-08-18 22:08:24,806 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)
   This means the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]

2) The expectation value of S_y is calculated as ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]
   ⟨ψ| = [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]

5) First, multiply σ_y with |ψ⟩:
   σ_y|ψ⟩ = [0 -i; i 0] * [3i; 4]
           = [-4i; 3i]

6) Then multiply ⟨ψ| with the result:
   ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i; 3i]
              = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(3i)
              = 12 + 12i
              = 12 * (1 + i)

7) This equals 12*hbar/25
