=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:38,613 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's analyze this systematically:

1. Hi-C findings:
- Detected interaction between promoter and enhancer
- Located ~1 Mb apart
- Shows statistically significant interaction signal
- Functional evidence from dCas9-KRAB experiment suggests real interaction (reduced expression)

2. FISH validation:
- Failed to confirm the Hi-C interaction
- Suggests potential methodological limitations

3. Possible explanations:
A) Interaction frequency might be too low for FISH sensitivity
B) Structural variations could alter expected linear distance
C) Interaction distance might be below FISH resolution
D) Potential Hi-C false-positive signal

4. Key considerations:
- dCas9-KRAB experiment supports functional interaction
- Statistical significance in Hi-C suggests real signal
- FISH is less sensitive than Hi-C for detecting rare interactions

5. Reasoning:
- The most likely explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low to be reliably detected by FISH
- FISH typically requires more frequent/stable interactions
- Hi-C can detect transient or low-frequency interactions
- Functional validation supports interaction's existence

This points strongly to option A as the most probable explanation.
