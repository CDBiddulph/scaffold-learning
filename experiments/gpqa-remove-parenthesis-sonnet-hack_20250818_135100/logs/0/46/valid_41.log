2025-08-18 22:08:46,752 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We are given that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV.

2. Emitted light energy indicates the energy gap between electronic states.

3. The absorbed color will be the complementary color to the emitted light.

4. The visible light spectrum ranges from about 1.5 to 3.5 eV.

5. To determine the complementary color, I'll convert the energy to wavelength:
   λ = (h * c) / E
   Where h = Planck's constant, c = speed of light, E = energy

6. Calculating the wavelength:
   λ = (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / (2.3393 eV * 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV)
   This wavelength corresponds to green light.

7. The complementary color to green is magenta/red.

8. Looking at the options, red matches this analysis.
