=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:44,991 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1. The scenario involves ChIP-seq of the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells

2. Key observation: Peaks disappear when changing from PFA to PFA+DSG fixation

3. IKAROS is a critical transcription factor involved in lymphocyte development and regulation

4. Disappearing peaks suggests a specific chromatin interaction pattern sensitive to different crosslinking conditions

5. Cross-linking sensitivity often indicates:
- Transient protein-DNA interactions
- Dynamically regulated genomic regions
- Regions with open/accessible chromatin

6. Active promoters and enhancers are characterized by:
- High transcription factor binding
- Open chromatin structure
- Dynamic protein interactions
- Sensitivity to crosslinking conditions

7. These regions would be most likely to show peak "disappearance" with altered fixation methods due to their dynamic nature

8. By contrast:
- Random locations (A) would not show systematic peak loss
- Repeats (B) are typically more static
- Intronic regions (C) are less likely to have such sensitive interactions

9. The evidence strongly points to active promoters and enhancers as the most probable location of these disappearing peaks
