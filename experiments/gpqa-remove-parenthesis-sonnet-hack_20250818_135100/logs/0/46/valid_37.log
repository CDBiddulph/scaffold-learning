=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:08:41,097 [INFO] Direct response: 'Let's solve this step by step:

1) This appears to reference two fundamental physical constants and interactions.

2) The fine structure constant (Î±) is approximately 1/137, which is a dimensionless fundamental physical constant.

3) The distance mentioned (137 meters) is likely intentionally chosen to hint at this constant.

4) The question describes point particles experiencing an attractive and repulsive force.

5) In quantum electrodynamics, the strength of interactions is related to the fine structure constant.

6) The ratio of forces might be expected to relate to 1/137.

7) Looking at the options, 1/137 directly corresponds to option A.

8) Let's verify the dimensional analysis and physical reasoning:
- The fine structure constant relates electromagnetic interactions
- It emerges in quantum electrodynamic calculations
- Its numerical value suggests a fundamental scaling relationship

9) The problem seems deliberately constructed to evoke the fine structure constant.

10) Option A (1/137) matches this reasoning most closely.
