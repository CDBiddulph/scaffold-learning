1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   • Energy ∝ Temperature

2) Peak energy for star A: 7.21 eV
   Peak energy for sun: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio:
   T(A)/T(sun) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) Luminosity (L) is related to radius (R) and temperature (T) by:
   L ∝ R² × T⁴

5) We know star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

6) Let's set up the proportion:
   24 = (R(A)/R(sun))² × (T(A)/T(sun))⁴

7) Substitute temperature ratio from step 3:
   24 = (R(A)/R(sun))² × (5.11)⁴

8) Solve for R(A)/R(sun):
   (R(A)/R(sun))² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   R(A)/R(sun) = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   R(A)/R(sun) = 0.17

9) Check the given options. 0.17 matches option D.
