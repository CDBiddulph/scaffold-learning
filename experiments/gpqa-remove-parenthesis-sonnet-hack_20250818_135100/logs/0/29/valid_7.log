=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 21:41:27,074 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the conditions of a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate:
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing happens to the target qubit
   • If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In this input state, the first qubit is |0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩ and the second qubit is |0⟩

3) Since the first (control) qubit's condition is satisfied (|0⟩), the gate operation will NOT change the target (second) qubit

4) This means the output will keep the second qubit at |0⟩

5) Let's look carefully at the output options:
   • Option A keeps the original state with the second qubit at |0⟩
   • Option B changes the second qubit to |1⟩ (incorrect)
   • Option C changes the state structure
   • Option D changes the state structure

6) Option A perfectly matches our reasoning: 
   U_{C-NOT}|ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

Therefore, the reasoning and careful analysis lead us to select Option A.
