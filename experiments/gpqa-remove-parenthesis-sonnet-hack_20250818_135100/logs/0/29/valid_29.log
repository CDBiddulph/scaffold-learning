Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 21:42:03,147 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a saturated hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must have:
   - A chiral carbon center (asymmetric carbon)
   - Tetrahedral structure with 4 different substituents

2) Let's analyze the elemental composition first:
   - All data sets show percentages consistent with hydrocarbons
   - The molecular mass can be calculated from the percentages

3) Let's calculate the molecular formulas:
   A) m/z = 72, empirical formula likely C5H12
   B) m/z = 86, empirical formula likely C6H14
   C) m/z = 58, empirical formula likely C4H10
   D) m/z = 100, empirical formula likely C7H16

4) For optical activity, we need a molecule with a chiral center:
   - 2-methylbutane (option A) has a chiral carbon
   - 3-methylpentane (option B) has a chiral carbon
   - Butane (option C) is symmetric
   - 3-methylhexane (option D) has a chiral carbon

5) 2-methylbutane (option A) contains a chiral carbon and matches the data
