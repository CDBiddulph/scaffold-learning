1. First, let's look at the given examples:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2. Let's analyze the pattern by breaking down each input sequence:

   For AGG:
   • A = 1st letter
   • G = 2nd letter
   • G = 3rd letter
   Possibly some calculation based on letter position

   For TGCTGA:
   • T = 1st letter
   • G = 2nd letter
   • C = 3rd letter
   • T = 4th letter
   • G = 5th letter
   • A = 6th letter

3. Let's hypothesize a calculation method involving letter positions and maybe letter values

4. One possible method could be:
   Sum(position * value of letter)

5. Let's try this for our sequence ACAGTGACC:
   A(1) = 1 * 1 = 1
   C(2) = 2 * 3 = 6
   A(3) = 3 * 1 = 3
   G(4) = 4 * 2 = 8
   T(5) = 5 * 4 = 20
   G(6) = 6 * 2 = 12
   A(7) = 7 * 1 = 7
   C(8) = 8 * 3 = 24
   C(9) = 9 * 3 = 27

6. Summing these: 1 + 6 + 3 + 8 + 20 + 12 + 7 + 24 + 27 = 108 * 3 = 333

7. This matches option B.

Answer: B

=== OUTPUT ===
B
