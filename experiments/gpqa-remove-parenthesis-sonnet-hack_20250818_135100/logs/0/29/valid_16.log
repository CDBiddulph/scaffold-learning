=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 21:41:45,771 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what happened:
- A CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing experiment was performed on a 1-cell fertilized egg
- When the animal was later sequenced, different tissues had different genomes

2. Key considerations:
- This suggests the genetic modification did not occur simultaneously or uniformly in all cells during early embryo development
- This phenomenon is called "mosaicism"

3. Let's analyze each option:

A) Converting mRNA to cDNA and genome incorporation: 
- Unlikely mechanism for genomic differences
- mRNA conversion to genomic DNA is not a standard mechanism in this context

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation:
- Also not a typical mechanism for genetic modification
- CRISPR works through Cas9 protein cutting and donor DNA repair

C) Surrogate mother's DNA incorporation:
- Highly improbable
- DNA transfer between mother and embryo doesn't occur this way

D) Continuous Cas9 cutting and donor DNA incorporation:
- Most probable explanation
- During early embryo development, CRISPR components could be active at different times
- This could lead to genetic modifications occurring in some cells but not others
- Resulting in a mosaic genome where different tissues have different genetic compositions

4. Reasoning supports option D as the most likely cause of the observed genomic differences.
