2025-08-18 21:41:27,291 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equation for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) We know the stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5 × 10¹⁰, which means:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) We are given that the stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M

4) Rearranging the stability constant equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5) Assuming complete dissociation, [EDTA⁴⁻] = [Ca²⁺]

6) Substituting the values:
   [Ca²⁺] = (5 × 10¹⁰) × (0.02) / [Ca²⁺]

7) Solving this quadratic equation:
   [Ca²⁺]² = (5 × 10¹⁰) × (0.02)
   [Ca²⁺] = √((5 × 10¹⁰) × (0.02))
   [Ca²⁺] = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

8) This matches option B.
