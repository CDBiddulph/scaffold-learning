=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:42:14,556 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the context:
- Low Earth orbit satellites are detecting astronomical objects
- Their localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Arc minute precision and potential object distances:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
- This suggests the objects are very far away
- The farther an object is, the larger the absolute distance uncertainty for a given angular uncertainty

3. Analyzing the options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
- These are extreme cosmic distances
- Suitable for objects like distant galaxies
- Consistent with large angular uncertainty

B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years
- These are distances within our galaxy
- Reasonable for detection of stars, nebulae, etc.
- Also consistent with localization precision

C) 10 or 100 light years
- Very close distances within our solar neighborhood
- Too small for such large angular uncertainties

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
- These are extremely short distances
- Not suitable for astronomical object detection

4. Conclusion:
Options A and B are plausible, but A (1 million/billion light years) best matches the large angular uncertainty.
