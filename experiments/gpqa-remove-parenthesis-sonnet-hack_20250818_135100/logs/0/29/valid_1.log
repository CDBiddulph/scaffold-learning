2025-08-18 21:41:23,322 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the decay characteristics of Caesium-137:
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
- It decays by emitting a beta particle and gamma rays

2) To calculate the activity, we need to use the decay equation:
A = λN
Where A = activity, λ = decay constant, N = number of atoms

3) The decay constant λ can be calculated as:
λ = ln(2) / half-life
λ = 0.693 / (30 years × 365.25 days/year × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes)
λ ≈ 4 × 10^-9 per minute

4) Total number of atoms = 10^17

5) Activity calculation:
A = 4 × 10^-9 × 10^17 = 4 × 10^8 decays per minute

6) Gamma ray detection considerations:
- Not all decays produce detectable gamma rays
- Typical gamma emission probability for Cs-137 is about 0.85
- Detector solid angle at 4 meters would be small

7) Estimated detected gamma rays: 
About 10^6 gamma rays in 80 minutes
