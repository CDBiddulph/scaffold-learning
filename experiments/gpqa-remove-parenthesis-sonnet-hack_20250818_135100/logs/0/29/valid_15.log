=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:41:41,866 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram determines its order of complexity and divergence.

2) The power of loop contributions can be inferred from the structure of the regularization expression.

3) A critical clue is the power of the denominator (4π)^6. This suggests a relationship with the number of loops.

4) In general, for n-loop diagrams in quantum field theory, the denominator's power follows a pattern related to the number of loops.

5) The power of (4π)^6 is 6, which suggests a 6-loop diagram.

6) Checking the energy scale ratio (Q/M)^2 and the constants (α^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6) also support this interpretation.

7) The physical constant structure is consistent with a complex multi-loop quantum correction calculation.

8) The factor of (4π)^-6 specifically points to 6 loops.

Therefore, the Feynman diagram most likely contained 6 loops.
