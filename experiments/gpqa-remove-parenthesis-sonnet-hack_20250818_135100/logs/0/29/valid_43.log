=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 21:42:27,091 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's analyze the requirements:
- We need to clone this sequence into the expression vector
- We want directional cloning
- The vector's multiple cloning site (MCS) contains HindIII, KpnI, BamHI sites

2) Analyzing the primer sequences in the options:
- They include restriction enzyme recognition sites
- The actual gene sequence is added after the restriction site

3) Looking at the gene sequence:
- Starts with ATG (start codon)
- We want to preserve the reading frame for expression

4) Matching primer sites to the vector's MCS:
- Forward primer should use a site that matches a site on the vector
- Reverse primer should use a different site to ensure directional cloning

5) Examining option D:
- Forward primer has BamHI site (matches vector's BamHI site)
- Reverse primer has HindIII site (matches vector's HindIII site)
- Ensures correct orientation
- Preserves original gene sequence and start codon

6) The primer sequences in D would allow directional cloning into the vector's multiple cloning site.
