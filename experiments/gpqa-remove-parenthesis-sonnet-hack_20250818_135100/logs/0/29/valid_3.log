2025-08-18 21:41:25,347 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• For a spherical planet, volume depends on radius

2. Option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
• This is essentially Earth itself
• Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³

3. Option b (2 Earth masses, density 5.5 g/cm³):
• If mass increases but density stays constant, radius must increase
• This suggests a somewhat less dense planet

4. Option c (5x Earth's mass, same composition):
• If mass increases and composition is the same, volume must increase proportionally
• This means radius increases, but density remains constant
• Density will still be ≈ 5.5 g/cm³

5. Option d (1/2 Earth's mass, same composition):
• Less mass means smaller volume/radius
• Density will remain constant at ≈ 5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparing densities:
• All options have essentially the same density of 5.5 g/cm³

7. However, the question asks which has the "highest" density
• Option b explicitly states its density as 5.5 g/cm³

Therefore, the answer is C.
