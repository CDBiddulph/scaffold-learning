0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

2025-08-18 21:42:01,722 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
   Where ψ is the spin state and ψ† is its conjugate transpose

2) The given spin state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]†

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) Let's calculate the expectation value:
   <S_y> = [3i, 4] [0 -i; i 0] [3i; 4]

5) First, multiply σ_y by the state vector:
   [0 -i; i 0] [3i; 4] = [-4i; 3i]

6) Then multiply the first vector by this result:
   [3i, 4] [-4i; 3i] = 3i(-4i) + 4(3i)
                      = 12 + 12i

7) The real value is 12

8) Normalizing: 3i² + 4² = -9 + 16 = 25

9) The expectation value is (12/25)*ℏ

10) This matches choice A: 12*ℏ/25
