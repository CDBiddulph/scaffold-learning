=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:41:51,780 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) Substituent effects on para-substitution are determined by:
- Electron-donating groups (EDGs)
- Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)
- Their ability to stabilize the carbocation intermediate

2) Let's analyze each substituent:
- CH3 (1): Strong EDG, strongly activates ring, favors para position
- COOC2H5 (2): Weak EWG, slightly deactivates ring
- Cl (3): Weak EWG, slightly deactivates ring
- NO2 (4): Strong EWG, strongly deactivates ring
- C2H5 (5): Similar to CH3, EDG, activates ring
- COOH (6): Strong EWG, deactivates ring

3) Ranking para-substitution from lowest to highest:
- NO2 will have the lowest para yield (strong deactivation)
- COOH and COOC2H5 will have low para yields
- Cl will have moderate para yield
- CH3 and C2H5 will have high para yields

4) This matches the order: 4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5
