2025-08-18 21:41:39,993 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) represents:
- It's an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model
- Incorporates higher-dimensional operators to describe physics beyond the Standard Model

2. Lorentz Symmetry:
- This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime
- All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz invariance
- This means the theory must look the same in all inertial reference frames
- MUST be respected ✓

3. Poincaré Symmetry:
- Combines Lorentz symmetry with spacetime translations
- A fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories
- Also MUST be respected by SMEFT operators ✓

4. CP Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P)
- Not universally required in SMEFT
- Some SMEFT operators might violate CP symmetry
- Optional, not mandatory ✗

5. CPT Symmetry:
- Combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T)
- A fundamental symmetry of quantum field theories
- Derived from Lorentz and quantum mechanics principles
- MUST be respected ✓

Therefore, the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4.
