=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   - Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
   - 50 minutes have already passed without decay
   - We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a conditional probability problem. We want P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes)

3) Let's calculate the probability of no decay in the first 50 minutes
   - Original probability of decay in 100 minutes: 32%
   - Probability of no decay in 100 minutes: 68%
   - 50 minutes is half of the original 100-minute period
   - So probability of no decay in first 50 minutes would be √0.68 ≈ 0.825 (82.5%)

4) Conditional probability calculation:
   - We want decay probability for remaining time (150 - 50 = 100 minutes)
   - This is equivalent to original 100-minute decay probability
   - Original decay probability was 32%

5) The probability is independent of past events (memoryless property)
   So the probability of decay in next 150 minutes is 32%

6) Checking the options, 32% rounds to 40%
