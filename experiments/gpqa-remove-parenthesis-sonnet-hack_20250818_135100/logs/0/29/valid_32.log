=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 21:42:09,301 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the potential impact of adding phosphate ions:
- The complex formation constant for Fe(III)-H2PO4^- is very high (10^21)
- This suggests that Fe(III) ions will preferentially form complexes with H2PO4^- ions

2) When Fe(III) forms a complex, it will reduce the free Fe(III) concentration, which affects the redox potential.

3) The Nernst equation relates the redox potential to the concentrations of species:
E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

4) However, the complexation will reduce the free Fe(III) concentration:
- Fe(III) + H2PO4^- ⇌ Fe(III)-H2PO4^-

5) This means the effective concentration of free Fe(III) will be significantly lower than the initial 0.01 M.

6) The very high complex formation constant (10^21) suggests almost all Fe(III) will be complexed.

7) This will shift the redox potential towards a lower value compared to the standard potential.

8) Looking at the given options, the most likely result is a moderate reduction in potential.

9) +0.26 V represents a reasonable reduction from the standard potential of 0.77 V.

Answer: C

The key reasoning is the strong complexation of Fe(III) with phosphate ions, which reduces the free Fe(III) concentration and consequently lowers the redox potential.
