1) First, recall that the color of light absorbed is complementary to the color of light emitted.

2) The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV.

3) To determine the color, we'll use the approximate energy ranges for visible light colors:
• Violet: 3.1-2.5 eV
• Blue: 2.5-2.3 eV
• Green: 2.3-2.0 eV
• Yellow: 2.0-1.7 eV
• Orange: 1.7-1.5 eV
• Red: 1.5-1.0 eV

4) The emission energy (2.3393 eV) falls in the blue-green transition region.

5) Since this is the emission color, the absorbed color will be its complementary color.

6) The complementary color to blue-green is red.

7) Let's verify the absorption energy range for red is approximately 1.5-1.0 eV, which is consistent with our calculation.

8) Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.
