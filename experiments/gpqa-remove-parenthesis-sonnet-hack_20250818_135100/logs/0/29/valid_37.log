=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

1) First, let's consider what the question implies about the forces:
   • The particles have the smallest possible charges and least mass
   • They are separated by 137 meters

2) The two forces mentioned are:
   • An attractive force (likely gravitational)
   • A repulsive force (likely electromagnetic)

3) Let's recall the fundamental force equations:
   • Gravitational force: F = G(m1m2)/r²
   • Electromagnetic force: F = k(q1q2)/r²

4) Key observations:
   • Both forces follow an inverse square law
   • The charges/masses are the smallest possible
   • Distance is exactly 137 meters

5) The question asks for the ratio of repulsive to attractive force strength
   • This suggests the distance might have special significance
   • The separation is exactly 137 meters

6) Checking the answer choices, 1/137 suggests a simple relationship

7) The pattern suggests the ratio of forces is inversely proportional to the separation distance

8) Indeed, 1/137 matches this expectation perfectly
