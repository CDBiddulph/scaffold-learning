=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:42:26,815 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Current Reaction Conditions:
- Temperature: 300°C
- Current result: Excellent selectivity but unchanged conversion after catalyst modifications

2. Thermodynamic Considerations:
- Temperature affects reaction kinetics and equilibrium
- Lower temperatures typically:
   a) Reduce reaction rate
   b) Can shift equilibrium towards reactants
   c) Minimize side reactions like polymerization

3. Catalyst Considerations:
- Increasing catalyst amount didn't change exit composition
- Suggests the reaction might be:
   a) Mass transfer limited
   b) Approaching thermodynamic equilibrium
   c) Catalyst is already at maximum effectiveness

4. Analysis of Options:
- Option A: Unacceptable - giving up prematurely
- Option B: Incomplete - doesn't consider potential polymerization risks
- Option C: Most comprehensive approach
   - Decrease temperature to control reaction dynamics
   - Increase catalyst amount
   - Explicitly acknowledge polymerization risk
- Option D: Incorrect - increasing temperature would likely:
   - Accelerate unwanted side reactions
   - Potentially cause polymerization
   - Reduce selectivity

5. Reasoning Conclusion:
Option C provides the most balanced, scientifically sound approach to addressing the conversion challenge.
