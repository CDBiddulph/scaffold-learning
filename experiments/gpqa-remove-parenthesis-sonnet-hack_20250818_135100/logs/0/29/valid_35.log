=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:42:12,323 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Analysis:
- Detected a significant interaction between an active promoter and active enhancer
- Bins are 5kb in size
- Linear distance between them is ~1 Mb
- Interaction signal is statistically highly significant

2. FISH Validation:
- Could not confirm the interaction detected by Hi-C

3. Additional Experiment:
- Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%

4. Key Considerations:
- The dCas9-KRAB experiment suggests a functional relationship between the enhancer and promoter
- This means the interaction is likely real, not a complete false positive

5. Potential Reasons for Hi-C/FISH Discrepancy:
- A: Low interaction frequency could make FISH detection challenging
- B: Structural variations might alter interaction perception
- C: Linear distance seems standard for FISH detection
- D: False-positive signals do occur in Hi-C, but functional evidence argues against this

6. Reasoning:
- The functional impact of dCas9-KRAB suggests a genuine interaction
- The most probable explanation is that the interaction frequency is too low for reliable FISH detection
