=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 21:42:19,776 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding ChIP-seq and fixation:
- ChIP-seq identifies protein-DNA interactions
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) is a common crosslinking agent
- DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is a more stringent, longer-range crosslinker

2. Disappearing peaks suggest:
- The initial fixation method (PFA) captured transient or weak interactions
- DSG fixation is more rigid and might disrupt more dynamic protein-DNA interactions

3. Where are such dynamic interactions most likely?
- Active regulatory elements experience frequent protein turnover
- Promoters and enhancers have high transcription factor binding dynamics
- Transcription factors like IKAROS move quickly on/off DNA
- These regions have rapid, transient interactions that PFA can capture but DSG might disrupt

4. Characteristics of the other options:
- Random locations: Unlikely to have systematic interaction differences
- Repeats: Generally more stable, less dynamic
- Introns: Generally less transcription factor binding activity

5. Conclusion: Disappearing peaks are most likely at active promoters and enhancers, where protein-DNA interactions are most dynamic.
