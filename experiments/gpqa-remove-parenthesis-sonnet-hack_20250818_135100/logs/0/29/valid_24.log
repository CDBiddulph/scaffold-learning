=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:41:55,450 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance each particle travels in 1e-5s and compare this to the total distance of 13000m.

2) Distance calculation:
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Time = 1e-5s

3) For each particle:
- Zeta (0.96c): 
  Distance = 0.96 × c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2880m

- Eta (0.9c):
  Distance = 0.9 × c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2700m

- Chi (0.88c):
  Distance = 0.88 × c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2640m

- Lambda (0.93c):
  Distance = 0.93 × c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 2790m

4) Comparing distances to 13000m:
- None reach the ground fully
- Order will depend on relative distance traveled

5) By order of distance traveled:
Zeta (2880m) > Lambda (2790m) > Eta (2700m) > Chi (2640m)

This matches option B.
