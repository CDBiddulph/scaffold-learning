1) First, let's look at the structure of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid:
   • It has a 6-membered ring
   • Contains a double bond
   • Has a vinyl group
   • Contains an aldehyde (formyl) group
   • Contains a carboxylic acid group

2) When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations will likely occur:
   • The vinyl group will be converted to an alkyl group (reduction)
   • The double bond will be reduced
   • The aldehyde group will be reduced to an alcohol
   • The carboxylic acid group will be reduced to an alcohol

3) Let's calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency:
   • Originally the molecule has 1 ring
   • 1 double bond
   • 1 aldehyde group
   • Index of hydrogen deficiency = 1 (ring) + 1 (double bond) + 1 (aldehyde) = 3

4) After reduction:
   • No rings
   • No double bonds
   • No multiple groups
   • The index of hydrogen deficiency becomes 0

5) Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 0.
