2025-08-18 21:41:59,739 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole:
   S = kA/4l_p²
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant, A is the event horizon area, and l_p is the Planck length

2) We're given the angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs

3) First, convert angular size to actual size:
   • At distance d, size is θ * d
   • θ in radians = (10^-17 * π/180) degrees
   • Size = (10^-17 * π/180) * (10^10 * 3.086 * 10^16 m)
   • Size ≈ 10^-7 m (radius)

4) Event horizon area:
   • A = 4πr²
   • A ≈ 4π * (10^-7)² 
   • A ≈ 10^-13 m²

5) Substituting in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:
   • S ≈ (k * 10^-13) / (4 * (10^-35)²)
   • S ≈ 10^62 J/K

6) Checking the answer choices, this corresponds to option C.
