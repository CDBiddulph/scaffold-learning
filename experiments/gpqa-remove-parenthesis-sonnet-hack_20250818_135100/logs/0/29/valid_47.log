=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

2025-08-18 21:42:33,232 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Background Understanding
- Oblique Parameters (S, T, U) are sensitive to radiative corrections in electroweak precision tests
- Multi-Higgs-Doublet Models (MHDM) introduce additional scalar sectors
- Breit-Wigner corrections account for resonance effects in quantum processes

2. Theoretical Considerations
- Breit-Wigner corrections can modify loop-level contributions
- These corrections depend on:
   a) Mass of charged scalars
   b) Coupling strengths
   c) Quantum interference effects

3. Physics Analysis
- In most MHDMs, Breit-Wigner corrections provide more nuanced information
- They capture resonance effects not fully represented in original parameters
- The corrections can potentially reveal additional New Physics signatures

4. Specific Dependence
- The impact varies with charged scalar masses
- Not a uniform "big difference" across all parameter spaces
- Constrained by specific model details

5. Constraint Quality
- Breit-Wigner corrections generally provide MORE precise constraints
- Offer more granular information about potential New Physics

6. Conclusion
The answer suggests the constraints depend on charged scalar masses, indicating a nuanced, context-dependent improvement.
