=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 21:41:55,846 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given conditions:
- Inner sphere radius = d1
- Outer sphere radius = 100d1
- Wave function is time-independent
- Wave function is spherically symmetric
- Wave function has no imaginary part

2) The probability of finding the particle is equal (P) in two regions:
- Between d1 and 2*d1
- Between 2*d1 and 3*d1

3) For a spherically symmetric wave function, the probability is proportional to r²Ψ(r)², where Ψ(r) is the wave function.

4) The probability in a spherical shell is proportional to:
   P ∝ ∫(r²Ψ(r)²) dr from lower to upper radial boundary

5) If the probabilities are equal in two shells of equal volume, the integrated r²Ψ(r)² must be constant.

6) This means Ψ(r) must be proportional to 1/r for the probability to remain constant.

7) Therefore, the wave function has the form Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r.
