=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 21:42:21,988 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) This is a problem involving relativistic light propagation in a moving medium.

2) We need to apply the relativistic velocity transformation formula.

3) In special relativity, when a medium with refractive index n moves with velocity v relative to the observer, the velocity of light in the moving medium is transformed.

4) The relativistic velocity transformation formula is:
   u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/cÂ²)
   Where u is the speed of light in the medium, v is the medium's velocity, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.

5) In this problem, we're given c = 1, and u = 1/n (speed of light in the medium)

6) Substituting these values into the transformation formula:
   u' = ((1/n) - v) / (1 - ((1/n)v))

7) After algebraic manipulation, this simplifies to:
   u' = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

8) This matches option D.

9) Let's verify the dimensions and physical meaning: 
   - When v = 0, u' = 1/n (light speed in stationary medium)
   - The formula handles relative motion correctly

Therefore, the answer is based on the relativistic velocity transformation.
