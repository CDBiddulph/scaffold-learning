=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:03:37,723 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C detected a significant interaction between an active promoter and enhancer bins:
- They are separated by ~1 Mb linear distance
- The interaction was statistically significant

2. FISH could not validate this interaction:
- This suggests the interaction might be more complex than a simple linear contact

3. dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by 20%:
- This indicates a functional relationship exists between the enhancer and promoter
- The functional link suggests the interaction is real, not just a Hi-C artifact

4. Considering the possible reasons for Hi-C vs FISH discrepancy:
- Option A suggests the interaction might be too weak for FISH detection
- Option B implies structural variations could affect interaction measurement
- Option C suggests the linear distance is too short for FISH
- Option D suggests a Hi-C false positive

5. Analysis:
- The functional evidence (reduced expression) makes a complete false positive (D) unlikely
- The 1 Mb distance is not typically too short for FISH
- Structural variations could alter the perceived interaction geometry

Based on this reasoning, structural variations seem the most likely explanation for the inconsistency.
