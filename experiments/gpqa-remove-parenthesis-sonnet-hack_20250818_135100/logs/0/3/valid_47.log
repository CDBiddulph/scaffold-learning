=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:04:08,616 [INFO] Memory check response: Let me reason through this step-by-step:

1) Oblique Parameters (S, T, U parameters) are quantum corrections that parameterize modifications to electroweak precision observables in extended Higgs models.

2) Multi-Higgs-doublet models (such as 2HDM) introduce additional scalar states that can modify these parameters.

3) Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance effects of new intermediate states, which could potentially refine the precision of constraints.

4) In many theoretical studies, including those by Peskin, Takeuchi, and others, these corrections can indeed provide more nuanced constraints, especially when charged scalars have masses in certain ranges.

5) The specific dependence on charged scalar masses suggests that the correction's significance is not uniform.

6) The language "a better constraint" implies a comparative improvement in the precision of detecting New Physics.

7) Given the conditional nature and mass-dependent effect, the most precise answer appears to be that the improvement depends on the specific charged scalar masses.

This reasoning suggests that the Breit-Wigner corrections provide an improved constraint, but this improvement is contingent on the specific mass spectrum.
