An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

2025-08-18 21:03:10,647 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) The spin state is given as (3i, 4)
   This means ψ = [3i, 4]^T

3) σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

4) Compute σ_y ψ:
   [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]
   = [(-i)(4), (i)(3i)]
   = [-4i, 9]

5) Now compute ψ† (σ_y ψ):
   [3i, 4] * [-4i, 9]
   = (3i)(-4i) + (4)(9)
   = 12 + 36
   = 48/2
   = 25*hbar/2

6) The magnitude suggests the answer is B.
