=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:12,334 [INFO] Memory check response: I'll solve this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand the radioactive decay of Caesium-137:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
• Decay constant (λ) = ln(2) / (30 years)

2) In 80 minutes (about 0.00152 years):
• Very little decay will occur
• Almost all 10^17 atoms remain present

3) Gamma ray emission rate:
• Cs-137 emits about 0.85 gamma rays per decay
• Each atom emits approximately 1 gamma ray per decay/half-life

4) Detector considerations:
• 2x3 cm detector at 4 meters
• Small solid angle means only a fraction of gamma rays will be detected
• Rough estimate: <1% of total gamma rays

5) Total gamma rays calculation:
• Total gamma rays ≈ 10^17 * probability of detection
• Seems to be in 10^6 to 10^8 range

6) Looking at options, most likely is:
• B) 100 million (10^8)

This matches the rough calculation.
