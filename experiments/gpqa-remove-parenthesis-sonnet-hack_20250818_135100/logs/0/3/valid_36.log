=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. First, understand the key information:
• Satellites are detecting astronomical objects
• Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Analyze the localization precision:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular uncertainty
• This suggests the detected objects are very far away

3. Evaluate the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years - these are extremely large cosmic distances
B) 1 thousand or 100 thousand light years - these are galactic/nearby galactic distances
C) 10 or 100 light years - these are very close, within our solar neighborhood
D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds - these are very short distances

4. Match precision with potential distances:
• The large angular uncertainty (100-200 arc minutes) suggests very distant objects
• This points to distances in millions or billions of light years
• Option A matches this criterion best

5. Verify the isotropic distribution requirement:
• Distant objects like galaxies or cosmic structures are typically distributed uniformly

Therefore, the most appropriate distance range is 1 million to 1 billion light years.
