=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:03:59,688 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Current experimental conditions:
- Temperature: 300°C
- Goal: Increase conversion without losing selectivity
- Previous attempts (changing catalyst amount/composition) did not work

2. Temperature considerations:
- Typically, lower temperatures can:
   a) Reduce side reactions
   b) Potentially improve catalyst performance
   c) Prevent unwanted polymerization

3. Examining the options:
- Option A is defeatist and not scientifically rigorous
- Option B lacks awareness of potential side reactions
- Option C acknowledges potential polymerization risk
- Option D suggests increasing temperature and decreasing catalyst, which seems counterintuitive

4. Key insights:
- Decreasing temperature might:
   - Slow down side reactions
   - Improve catalyst efficiency
   - Prevent potential product polymerization

5. Option C provides the most comprehensive approach:
- Systematically explores temperature reduction
- Increases catalyst amount
- Warns about potential polymerization
- Shows proactive problem-solving

6. Scientific reasoning supports a careful, methodical approach to optimize reaction conditions

Answer: C

Reasoning: Option C demonstrates a thoughtful, scientifically sound strategy to address the conversion challenge while being mindful of potential chemical complications.
