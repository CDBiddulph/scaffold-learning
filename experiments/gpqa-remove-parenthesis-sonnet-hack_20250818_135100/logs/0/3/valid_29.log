A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 21:03:15,242 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, to be optically active, a molecule must:
   - Contain at least one chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
   - Not have a plane of symmetry
   - Have a non-superimposable mirror image

2) This means we're looking for a saturated hydrocarbon with an odd number of carbons that doesn't have perfect symmetry.

3) Let's calculate molecular formulas from the elemental compositions:
   A) C5H12
   B) C6H14
   C) C4H8
   D) C7H16

4) Requirements for optically active hydrocarbons:
   - Must not have symmetry elements that make mirror images identical
   - 2nd or 3rd carbon must be asymmetric

5) Analyzing structures:
   A) C5H12 = pentane (has symmetric isomers, not optically active)
   B) C6H14 = hexane (symmetric isomers, not optically active)
   C) C4H8 = butene (unsaturated, not a saturated hydrocarbon)
   D) C7H16 = heptane (has chiral isomers due to asymmetric carbon)

6) The key is D, which represents C7H16 - a hydrocarbon with potential chirality.
