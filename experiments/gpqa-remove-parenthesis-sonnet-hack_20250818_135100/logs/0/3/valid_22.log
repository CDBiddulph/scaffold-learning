=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:03:04,830 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) The substituent's impact depends on its electron-donating or electron-withdrawing nature and its directing effect:
- Electron-donating groups: methyl (1), ethyl (5)
- Weak electron-withdrawing groups: chloro (3), ethyl ester (2)
- Strong electron-withdrawing groups: nitro (4), carboxylic acid (6)

2) Electron-donating groups generally increase para substitution
- Methyl (1) and ethyl (5) will have high para yields

3) Electron-withdrawing groups reduce para substitution
- Nitro (4) strongly deactivates the ring and reduces para yield
- Carboxylic acid (6) also reduces para yield

4) Comparing the substituents:
- Nitro (4) will have the lowest para yield
- Carboxylic acid (6) will have slightly higher
- Ethyl ester (2) will have moderate para yield
- Chloro (3) will have moderate para yield
- Methyl (1) and ethyl (5) will have highest para yields

5) This suggests the order from lowest to highest para yield is:
4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5

This matches option B.
