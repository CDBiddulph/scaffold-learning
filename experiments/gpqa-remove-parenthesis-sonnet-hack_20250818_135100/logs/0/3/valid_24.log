=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:03:07,287 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate how far each particle travels in 1e-5s:
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Each particle has the same time (1e-5s)

2) Calculate distance for each particle:
   - Zeta: 0.96c × 1e-5s = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 288 m
   - Eta: 0.9c × 1e-5s = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 270 m
   - Chi: 0.88c × 1e-5s = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 264 m
   - Lambda: 0.93c × 1e-5s = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 × 1e-5 = 279 m

3) Compare these distances to the ground level (13000m):
   - All particles fall short of reaching the ground

4) Rank distances from highest to lowest:
   Zeta (288m) > Lambda (279m) > Eta (270m) > Chi (264m)

5) This matches option B: zeta > lambda > eta > chi
