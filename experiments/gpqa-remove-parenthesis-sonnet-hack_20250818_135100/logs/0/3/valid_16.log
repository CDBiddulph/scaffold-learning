=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 21:02:42,269 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The key observation is that cells from different tissues in the transgenic animal have different genomes.

2. This suggests that the genetic modification did not occur uniformly during early embryo development.

3. In early embryogenesis, the first few cell divisions happen before significant genome editing can be completed.

4. Option A about cDNA conversion is unlikely and not a typical mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9.

5. Option B about guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation seems improbable.

6. Option C involving surrogate mother's DNA is not a plausible explanation.

7. Option D suggests that Cas9 continues to cut DNA at different stages of embryo development, potentially leading to stochastic or mosaic editing.

8. This continuous DNA cutting could result in:
- Different cells having different editing outcomes
- Incomplete or variable genetic modification across cell lineages
- A phenomenon called "mosaicism" in the resulting transgenic animal

9. Mosaicism is a well-documented potential outcome of early-stage genome editing, where not all cells are edited identically.

10. Option D provides the most scientifically sound explanation for the observed differences in genome sequences across tissues.
