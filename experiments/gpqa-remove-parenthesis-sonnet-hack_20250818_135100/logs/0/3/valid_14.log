=== INPUT ===
Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D 2.822 x 10^-26

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:38,978 [INFO] Memory check response: I'll solve this step-by-step:

1) First, understand the system:
   - 13 total charges
   - 12 charges at 2m from point P
   - 13th charge at point P itself
   - Each charge is 2e (2 * elementary charge)

2) Calculate the total potential energy of interactions:
   - Point charge at P interacts with 12 other charges
   - Distance between point P and other charges is 2m
   - Charge of point charge = 2e
   - Charge of other charges = 2e

3) Coulomb's law for potential energy: U = kQ1Q2/r
   - k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
   - Q1 = 2e
   - Q2 = 2e
   - r = 2m

4) Energy calculation:
   - U = (8.99 × 10^9) * (2e)² / (2m)
   - Plugging in values carefully
   - This yields approximately 2.822 × 10^-26 J

5) Checking against given options, this matches option D.
