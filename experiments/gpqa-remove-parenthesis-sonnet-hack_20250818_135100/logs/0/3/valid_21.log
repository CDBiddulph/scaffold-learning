S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
D (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

2025-08-18 21:02:57,523 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First reaction (TBS protection):
- The hydroxyl group of the starting cyclohexenone is protected with a TBS group
- This forms product 1

2) Second reaction (Ph2CuLi and benzyl bromide):
- Ph2CuLi is a nucleophilic cuprate reagent
- This will add a phenyl group to the enone system
- Benzyl bromide then alkylates the copper intermediate
- This introduces a benzyl group

3) Third reaction (LDA and iodomethane):
- LDA deprotonates the enolate
- Iodomethane alkylates this enolate, adding a methyl group
- This creates a new stereocenter

4) Final step (aqueous HCl):
- Removes the TBS protecting group
- Restores the original hydroxyl group

After carefully analyzing the sequence and stereochemistry, the structure looks most like option D.

The key features are:
- Benzyl group
- Phenyl group
- Hydroxyl group
- Methyl group
- Specific stereochemistry

Answer: D
