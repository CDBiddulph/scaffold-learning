2025-08-18 21:03:49,743 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, recall that when a substance absorbs light, it absorbs the complementary color to the one it emits.

2) The emission energy is given as 2.3393 eV.

3) Let's convert this to wavelength using the energy-wavelength relation:
   E = hc/λ
   λ = (hc)/E

4) After calculation, this energy corresponds to a wavelength in the blue-violet region of the visible spectrum.

5) Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel. So:
   - If the emission is blue, the absorption would be orange/yellow
   - If the emission is violet, the absorption would be yellow/green

6) Looking at the given options, yellow stands out as the most likely complement to the blue-violet emission.

7) The question asks specifically about the color of light ABSORBED.

Therefore, the color absorbed would be yellow.

Answer: D

Note: While I'm fairly confident in this reasoning, I do not recognize this as a specific exam question I've seen before.
