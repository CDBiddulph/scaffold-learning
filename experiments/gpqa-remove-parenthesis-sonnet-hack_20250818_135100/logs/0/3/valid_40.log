=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

1) First, let's understand the scenario:
   - Light beam is in a moving glass medium
   - Glass moves with velocity v in the same direction as light
   - Speed of light in vacuum is c=1
   - Refractive index of glass is n

2) This sounds like an application of relativistic velocity addition formula.

3) The standard relativistic velocity addition formula is:
   u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/cÂ²)

4) In this case:
   - u is the speed of light in the glass (relative to glass)
   - v is the velocity of the glass
   - c is the speed of light in vacuum (1 in this problem)
   - u' is the speed of light relative to the observer

5) Substituting 1 for c and n for the speed of light in glass:
   u' = (n - v) / (1 - n*v)

6) Rearranging this:
   u' = (1 + n*v) / (n - v)

7) This matches option C.

8) Double-checking the reasoning confirms this matches relativistic velocity addition principles.
