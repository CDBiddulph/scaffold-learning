=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 21:02:15,649 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the condition for the C-NOT gate: the first qubit (control qubit) must be in the |0⟩ state for any change to occur.

2) In the input state |ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩, the control qubit is indeed in the |0⟩ state.

3) When the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged.

4) So the output state will look the same as the input state:
   (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

5) This matches option A exactly.

Let's verify the other options:
- Option B changes the target qubit to |1⟩ (incorrect)
- Option C flips the qubits around (incorrect)
- Option D changes the target qubit in a different way (incorrect)

Therefore, the reasoning leads to option A as the correct answer.
