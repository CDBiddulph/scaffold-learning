2025-08-18 21:03:10,860 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = kA/4l_p^2
   Where k is Boltzmann's constant and l_p is the Planck length

2) The angular size θ relates to the radius R of the event horizon by:
   θ = R/d
   
3) We're given:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

4) To find R, rearrange: 
   R = θ * d
   R = 10^-17 * 10^10 * (parsec)
   R ≈ 10^-7 parsecs ≈ 10^15 meters

5) Black hole event horizon area:
   A = 4πR^2
   A ≈ 4π * (10^15)^2 = 4π * 10^30 m^2

6) Entropy:
   S ≈ (k/4l_p^2) * 10^30
   This will be order of magnitude 10^66 J/K

7) This matches answer choice D.
