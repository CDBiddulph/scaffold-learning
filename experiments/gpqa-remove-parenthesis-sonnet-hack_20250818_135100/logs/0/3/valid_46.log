=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


B 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 21:04:05,968 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature:
   T ∝ (peak energy)

2) For star A, peak is at 7.21 eV
   For sun, peak is at 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio will be: T(A)/T(sun) = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

4) We also know the star is 24 times more luminous than the sun

5) Luminosity is related to radius and temperature by: L ∝ R²T⁴

6) 24 = (R/R_sun)² * (T/T_sun)⁴

7) Substituting temperature ratio: 
   24 = (R/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴

8) Solving for R/R_sun:
   (R/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   R/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   R/R_sun ≈ 0.19

9) This matches option B.
