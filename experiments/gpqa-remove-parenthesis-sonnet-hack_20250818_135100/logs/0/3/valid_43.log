=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 21:03:59,390 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. We need to choose primer pair that:
- Allows directional cloning
- Uses the restriction sites in the vector's multiple cloning site (MCS)
- Adds the restriction enzyme sites to the PCR product

2. Looking at the MCS, we have HindIII and KpnI as potential sites

3. So we want primers that:
- Add HindIII site to 5' end (forward primer)
- Add KpnI site to 3' end (reverse primer)

4. Checking the options:
- Forward primers add HindIII (AAGCTT) at 5' end
- Reverse primers add KpnI (GGTACC) at 3' end

5. A and B both have correct forward primer (HindIII)
   - A uses KpnI on reverse, B uses BamHI on reverse

6. C uses SmaI (wrong), D uses BamHI (wrong)

7. B gives us HindIII on forward and BamHI on reverse, which doesn't match MCS

8. A gives HindIII on forward and KpnI on reverse - matching the MCS exactly
