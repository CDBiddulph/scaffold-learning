=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:03:40,341 [INFO] Memory check response: Let me break this down carefully:

1) First, the specific number 137 seems deliberately chosen, which suggests this might be referencing a physics constant or fundamental relationship.

2) The problem hints at two different forces - attractive and repulsive.

3) In fundamental particle physics, 137 is very close to the fine structure constant (approximately 1/137), which relates electromagnetic interactions.

4) The fine structure constant typically represents the strength of electromagnetic interactions.

5) A ratio involving 1/137 would make sense in this context.

6) Looking at the options, option A (1/137) seems the most consistent with the hints in the problem statement.

While I cannot definitively say I've seen this exact problem before, the reasoning suggests the problem is designed to hint at the fine structure constant and its inverse relationship.

The question implies the forces have an inverse square relationship, but the specific reference to 137 suggests something more precise about electromagnetic interaction strength.
