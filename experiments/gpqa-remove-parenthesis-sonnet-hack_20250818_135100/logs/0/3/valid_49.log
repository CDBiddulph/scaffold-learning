=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:04:09,887 [INFO] Memory check response: I'll solve this step-by-step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is a ketone in a rigid bicyclic system

2) UV irradiation suggests a photochemical reaction that might cause ring-opening or a photochemical rearrangement while maintaining the same molecular weight

3) The subsequent hydrogenation with Pd/C implies reduction of some functional group

4) The most likely scenario is that the UV irradiation causes a photochemical decarbonylation, forming a cyclic alkene

5) The Pd/C hydrogenation would then fully saturate this alkene, creating a fully saturated ring system

6) In the final product (2), the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be on a carbon adjacent to the previous ketone site

7) This hydrogen would likely experience coupling from its neighboring hydrogens

8) In a saturated ring system, this would typically result in a doublet of doublets splitting pattern

9) This corresponds to answer choice A

Answer: A

Note: While I've worked through the reasoning carefully, I cannot definitively state whether this is from a specific exam or problem set. The problem requires knowledge of photochemistry, organic synthesis, and NMR interpretation.
