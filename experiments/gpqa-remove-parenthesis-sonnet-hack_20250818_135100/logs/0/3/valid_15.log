=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:39,501 [INFO] Memory check response: Let me walk through this systematically:

1) In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the power of the coupling constant and the complexity of the integral.

2) The symbols provided include:
   - alpha^3
   - g^2
   - sqrt(2)
   - 8
   - 1/(4pi)^6
   - (Q/M)^2

3) The key indicator for loop count is typically the power in the denominator of the momentum/energy integration.

4) The 1/(4pi)^6 term suggests a denominator with 6 powers, which would correspond to a 6-loop diagram.

5) The other constants (alpha^3, g^2, etc.) support this complexity level.

6) While the coffee-stained diagram prevents direct visual confirmation, the mathematical expression strongly suggests a 6-loop diagram.

7) This matches option A.

Answer: A

Reasoning process: The denominator's power of 6 is the most direct evidence for the number of loops, with supporting complexity from the other constants.
