2025-08-18 21:02:37,036 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory

2. Lorentz Symmetry (Option 1):
• A fundamental requirement of any relativistic quantum field theory
• Must be respected by SMEFT
• This is definitely true

3. Poincare Symmetry (Option 2):
• Extends Lorentz symmetry by including translations
• A core symmetry of relativistic quantum field theories
• Must be respected by SMEFT
• This is also true

4. CP Symmetry (Option 3):
• Not a fundamental requirement of SMEFT
• CP violation is allowed in effective theories
• This is NOT necessarily respected

5. CPT Symmetry (Option 4):
• A fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
• Must be respected by any quantum field theory
• Essential for consistency of the theory
• This is definitely true

6. Combining these observations, we need options 1, 2, and 4

7. This corresponds to option A: 1, 2, 4
