=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:03:08,503 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, the wave function is time-independent and spherically symmetric.

2) The probability of finding the particle is equal in two concentric shell regions:
   - First shell: from d1 to 2*d1
   - Second shell: from 2*d1 to 3*d1

3) For these probabilities to be equal, the total probability in each shell must be the same.

4) The volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * (outer radius - inner radius)

5) If the wave function is |Ψ(r)|^2, the probability of finding the particle in a shell is proportional to:
   |Ψ(r)|^2 * r^2 * (outer radius - inner radius)

6) For these probabilities to be equal across different shells, |Ψ(r)|^2 must be proportional to 1/r^2

7) This means |Ψ(r)| must be proportional to 1/r

8) The wave function itself (ignoring normalization) would then be proportional to 1/r

9) This corresponds to choice A.
