=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
D 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:03:36,917 [INFO] Memory check response: Let me solve this step-by-step:

1. First, I'll look at the two given input-output pairs to see if I can identify a pattern:
   • AGG → 115
   • TGCTGA → 176

2. I'll try some basic pattern analysis:
   • First, these look like DNA/RNA sequences
   • The lengths are different: AGG is 3 letters, TGCTGA is 6 letters
   • The outputs are numerical and seem to increase with sequence length

3. Without an obvious mathematical formula, I'll inspect the letters:
   • In AGG, I see repeated G
   • In TGCTGA, multiple different letters

4. Without clear logic, I cannot confidently predict the output for ACAGTGACC

5. This suggests I do not recognize this as a standard problem and cannot determine the answer through deduction.

Since I cannot confidently reason out the answer based on the given information, and I do not recognize this as a known problem, my response is:

UNKNOWN
