trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
D 11

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:10,824 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, trans-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O) is treated with methylmagnesium bromide:
   - This will add a methyl group, creating an alcohol
   - Product 1 will have 10 carbon atoms

2) Product 1 is then treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC):
   - This oxidizes the alcohol to a ketone
   - Product 2 will still have 10 carbon atoms

3) Product 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO:
   - This looks like a Wittig-type reaction
   - It will likely extend the carbon chain
   - Starting with a 10-carbon ketone
   - Adding a 2-carbon unit from the reagent
   - Product 3 will have 12 carbon atoms

Therefore, product 3 contains 12 carbon atoms.

Answer: C
