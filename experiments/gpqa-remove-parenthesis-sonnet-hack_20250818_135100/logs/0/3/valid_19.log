=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:47,751 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, recall the equilibrium temperature formula:
   T ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) * R^(-1/2)
   Where A is albedo, R is orbital radius

2) We're given that:
   - Albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets
   - Temperature ratio (Planet1/Planet2) = 1.4
   - Temperature ratio (Planet2/Planet3) = 2.3
   - Mass ratio (Planet1/Planet2) = 1.15
   - Mass ratio (Planet2/Planet3) = 1.35

3) Since albedo is constant, temperature variation depends only on orbital radius

4) From temperature ratios, we can derive radius relationships:
   (R1/R2)^(-1/2) = 1.4
   (R2/R3)^(-1/2) = 2.3

5) Mass influences orbital period via Kepler's Third Law:
   P^2 ∝ R^3 / M

6) Solving these relationships leads to an orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1 of approximately 10.4

7) This matches option D.

Answer: D

Reasoning process:
- Used equilibrium temperature and orbital radius relationships
- Considered constant albedo effect
- Applied Kepler's Third Law
- Derived orbital period relationship
