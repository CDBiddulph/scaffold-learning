=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:16,264 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the equilibrium:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) We know the stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5x10^10, which is very large
   This suggests the equilibrium strongly favors the complex

3) The initial concentration of stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

4) We can use the equilibrium constant expression:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

5) Rearranging to solve for [Ca²⁺]:
   [Ca²⁺] = Kf * [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

6) Since Kf is very large, the equilibrium will strongly favor dissociation

7) Solving the equation gives [Ca²⁺] = 1.0 x 10^-2 M

8) Looking at the given options, this corresponds to option A.

Answer: A

I do not recognize this as a specific published problem, so I will not use the KNOWN/UNKNOWN format.
