=== INPUT ===
Using the molecular formula and 1H NMR data of compounds A and B, please identify the reactants, product, and type of reaction that occurs to form product C.

A(C6H13Br) : 3 signals, 1 singlet, and 2 triplets.
B(C4H6): 3 signals, 1 singlet, 1 triplet and 1 quartet.
C(C10H18): 5 signals, 1 singlet, 3 triplets and a quartet

A) It is a nucleophilic addition between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne.
B It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne to form 7,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
C) It is an electrophilic Substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-2-yne to form 6,7-dimethyloct-3-yne
D) It is a nucleophilic Substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane and 3-methylbut-1-yne to form 5-isopropyl-2,6-dimethylhept-3-yne.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:42,508 [INFO] Memory check response: Let me solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll analyze the molecular formulas and NMR data:
- A: C6H13Br (1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane)
- B: C4H6 (but-1-yne or but-2-yne)
- C: C10H18 (resulting product)

2. The NMR data provides structural hints:
- A has 3 signals (1 singlet, 2 triplets) suggesting a symmetrical structure
- B has 3 signals (1 singlet, 1 triplet, 1 quartet)
- C has 5 signals (1 singlet, 3 triplets, 1 quartet)

3. Analyzing the reaction possibilities:
- Options involve a reaction between an alkyl halide and an alkyne
- Likely mechanisms are nucleophilic substitution or addition

4. Comparing structural details and molecular formulas:
- Option B seems most plausible: nucleophilic substitution between 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane and but-1-yne

5. Verifying product structure matches C10H18 and NMR description

After careful reasoning, the evidence points to Option B.
