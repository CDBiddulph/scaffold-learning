=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:02:13,189 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we know the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes.

2) We're told 50 minutes have already passed without decay.

3) This is a conditional probability problem. We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived 50 minutes.

4) The key insight is to use the memoryless property of exponential decay:
   - The probability of decay depends only on the remaining time
   - Past survival does not change future decay probability

5) The remaining time period is 150 minutes

6) We can calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes using the known 32% decay rate for 100 minutes

7) Let's calculate: 
   (1 - 0.32) = 0.68 survival probability for 100 minutes
   
8) We want the survival probability for 150 minutes, which will be proportionally lower

9) By proportion: 
   150/100 * 0.32 = 0.48 or 48%

10) Therefore, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 48%
