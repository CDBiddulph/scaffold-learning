Which of the following sequences is correctly ordered by their distance from the Sun? When a parameter is not mentioned, assume it is zero. For the stars in the Solar Neighborhood (distance < 500 pc), assume that the total absorption in the V band relates to the color excess of the B-V color with an Rv value of 3.1.


a) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magnitude of 8 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
b) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
c) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 9 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
d) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
e) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
f) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magnitude of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag

A) b < d < e < a < c

B) b < a < f < c

C d < b < f < c

D) b < e < c < f

2025-08-18 21:03:27,099 [INFO] Memory check response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The distance modulus is given by: m - M = 5 log(d/10)
   Where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs

2) Let's calculate the distance for each scenario:

a) m - M = 8 - 8 = 0, so distance = 10 pc
   No extinction, no change

b) m - M = 7 - 8 = -1, so distance = 25.1 pc
   No extinction

c) m - M = 9 - 8 = 1, so distance = 251.2 pc
   No extinction

d) m - M = 7 - 8 = -1, with E(B-V) = 0.2
   Assuming Rv = 3.1, Av = 3.1 * 0.2 = 0.62
   So effective distance is slightly larger than 25.1 pc

e) m - M = 7 - 7 = 0, with E(B-V) = 0.2
   Av = 3.1 * 0.2 = 0.62
   So distance around 10 pc with some extinction

f) m - M = 7 - 7 = 0, no extinction, so 10 pc

3) Ordering from closest to furthest: b < d < e < a < c
