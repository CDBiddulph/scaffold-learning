=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

Key Concepts:
- Quantum gates (specifically Controlled-NOT or CNOT gate)
- Quantum state representation
- Tensor product state
- Quantum circuit operations

The problem involves analyzing the output of a CNOT gate with a specific input state, focusing on the gate's conditional operation based on the control qubit's state.
2025-08-18 21:57:47,163 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Understand the CNOT Gate Operation:
- CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate operates based on the control qubit's state
- If control qubit is |0⟩, NO change occurs
- If control qubit is |1⟩, target qubit is flipped

2. Analyze the Input State:
- First qubit: α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩
- Second qubit (control): |0⟩

3. CNOT Gate Condition Check:
- Control qubit is |0⟩
- Therefore, NO state change will occur
- This means the output state will remain structurally identical to input

4. Carefully Examine Options:
- Option A matches this exact condition
- Other options modify the state inappropriately
- Option A preserves both qubit states since control qubit is |0⟩

5. Verification:
- α|0⟩ remains unchanged
- β|1⟩ remains unchanged
- -γ|1⟩ remains unchanged
- Second qubit remains |0⟩

6. Systematic Elimination:
- Option B, C, D all incorrectly modify the state

Therefore, the scientific reasoning conclusively points to Option A.
