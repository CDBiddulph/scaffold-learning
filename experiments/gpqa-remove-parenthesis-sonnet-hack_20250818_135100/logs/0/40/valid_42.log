=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

Key Concepts:
- Hydrocarbon conversion
- Heterogeneous catalysis
- Reaction mechanisms
- Industrial chemical processes
- Cracking reactions
2025-08-18 21:58:54,410 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

Scientific Analysis:
1. The student is working on a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrocarbon conversion reaction
2. Current reaction conditions: 300°C
3. Goal: Increase reactant conversion per pass without losing selectivity
4. Previous attempts (changing catalyst amount/composition) failed

Key Considerations:
- Conversion is typically influenced by temperature, catalyst composition, and reactor design
- Increasing catalyst doesn't always guarantee higher conversion
- Temperature changes can dramatically affect reaction kinetics

Option Evaluation:
A) Unacceptable - scientifically passive approach
B) Partially correct, but lacks complete understanding of reaction dynamics
C) Most scientifically rigorous approach:
   - Lowering temperature can:
     * Reduce side reactions
     * Potentially improve catalyst efficiency
     * Minimize unwanted polymerization
   - Increasing catalyst amount might:
     * Provide more active sites
     * Enhance reaction rate
   - Shows awareness of potential polymerization risks

D) Incorrect - increasing temperature typically:
   - Accelerates side reactions
   - Can lead to uncontrolled polymerization
   - Reduces reaction selectivity

Reasoning Path:
- Temperature reduction can optimize reaction conditions
- Catalyst amount increase provides more reaction pathways
- Awareness of polymerization demonstrates scientific caution
