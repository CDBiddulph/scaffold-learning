Key Concepts:
- Apparent magnitude
- Distance modulus
- Luminosity
- Stellar brightness comparison
- Parsec as a distance unit
- Magnitude scale

The problem tests understanding of how star brightness relates to distance and individual stellar luminosities.
2025-08-18 21:58:21,782 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

Step 1: Understanding Apparent Magnitude
- Lower apparent magnitude values indicate brighter objects
- Brightness depends on both intrinsic luminosity and distance

Step 2: Distance Modulus Formula
m - M = 5 log(d/10), where:
m = apparent magnitude
M = absolute magnitude
d = distance in parsecs

Step 3: Analyze Each Option Quantitatively

a) 7 mag at 50 parsecs
   Less bright due to greater distance

b) 7 mag at 20 parsecs
   Closer, so potentially brighter

c) Two-star system: Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8, at 5 parsecs
   Combined brightness will be brighter than single stars
   Combined apparent magnitude can be calculated using magnitude addition formula

d) Absolute magnitude of 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   This is a standard reference point for absolute magnitude
   At this distance, apparent magnitude equals absolute magnitude

e) Two-star system with absolute magnitudes of 7 and 8 mag at 10 parsecs
   Combined brightness calculation needed

f) Two-star system with absolute magnitudes of 7 and 7 mag at 10 parsecs
   Both identical stars, symmetric configuration

Step 4: Comparative Analysis
- Option (c) has both stars at 5 parsecs, much closer than others
- Closer distance means higher apparent brightness
- The combined magnitude will be brighter than individual stars

Step 5: Verification
Magnitude addition for option (c):
m_combined = -2.5 log[10^(-m1/2.5) + 10^(-m2/2.5)]
            = -2.5 log[10^(-7/2.5) + 10^(-8/2.5)]
Will result in a very bright apparent magnitude

Conclusion: Option (c) will appear brightest due to closest distance and combined light of two stars.
