=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4

- Planetary equilibrium temperatures
- Planetary masses
- Orbital periods
- Comparative planetary dynamics
2025-08-18 21:58:08,490 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Understanding the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) Method:
- TTV allows detection of planetary interactions and orbital characteristics
- Enables precise measurements of planetary parameters

2. Equilibrium Temperature Relationships:
- Equilibrium temperature (Teq) is related to orbital distance and stellar properties
- Teq ∝ 1/√(orbital radius)

3. Temperature Ratio Analysis:
- Planet1/Planet2 temperature ratio = 1.4
- Planet2/Planet3 temperature ratio = 2.3

4. Mass Ratio Analysis:
- Planet1/Planet2 mass ratio = 1.15
- Planet2/Planet3 mass ratio = 1.35

5. Orbital Period Relationship:
- Kepler's Third Law: P² ∝ a³
- Where P is orbital period, a is semi-major axis

6. Calculation:
- Temperature ratios suggest increasing orbital distances
- Mass ratios support gradual increase in planetary parameters
- The systematic progression points towards an orbital period increase

7. Estimation:
- The temperature and mass progressions suggest an orbital period increase by a factor around 10

8. Option Analysis:
A) 3.2 - Too small
B) 4.4 - Reasonable but not precise
C) 33.4 - Extremely large
D) 10.4 - Most consistent with observed parameters
