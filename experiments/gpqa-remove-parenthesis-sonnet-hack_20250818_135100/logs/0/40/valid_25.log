=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 21:58:23,883 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Key Physics Analysis:
- Spherically symmetric time-independent wave function
- Probability is constant between two radial shells (d1 to 2*d1, and 2*d1 to 3*d1)
- Wave function relates to probability distribution

2. Probability Distribution Considerations:
- Constant probability implies equal probability volumes
- Volume of spherical shell ∝ r²
- If probability is constant, wave function must compensate for volume increase

3. Mathematical Reasoning:
- Spherical shell volume = 4πr²Δr
- For constant probability, wave function must have 1/r² dependence
- This ensures probability density (ψ²) remains constant across shells
- Wave function itself would then be proportional to 1/r

4. Detailed Mathematical Check:
- Probability ∝ |ψ|² 
- Volume ∝ r²
- To keep probability constant: ψ ∝ 1/r
- This ensures: |ψ|² = constant across radial shells

5. Option Evaluation:
A) 1/r ✓ Matches our reasoning
B) r² ✗ Would increase probability
C) 1/r² ✗ Would decrease probability too quickly
D) r ✗ Would increase probability
