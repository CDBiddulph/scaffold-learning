Key Concepts:
- Wien's displacement law
- Stellar radiation and blackbody spectrum
- Luminosity and stellar radius relationship
- Photon energy and temperature correlation

Reasoning steps:
1. Use Wien's displacement law: Temperature ∝ Peak Photon Energy
2. Calculate temperature ratios based on peak photon energies
3. Use Stefan-Boltzmann law relating luminosity to radius and temperature
4. Determine relative radius by comparing luminosity and temperature

Detailed calculation:
- Sun's peak: 1.41 eV
- Star A's peak: 7.21 eV
- Temperature ratio: 7.21/1.41 = 5.11
- Luminosity ratio: 24
- Use L ∝ R²T⁴
- Solve for radius ratio

Solving shows radius is around 0.19 solar radii.

Answer: B
2025-08-18 21:59:02,513 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this step by step using rigorous scientific reasoning:

1. Peak Photon Energy Analysis (Wien's Displacement Law):
- Sun's peak: 1.41 eV
- Star A's peak: 7.21 eV
- Energy ratio: 7.21/1.41 = 5.11
- This indicates Star A is much hotter than the Sun

2. Temperature Relationship:
- Peak energy is inversely proportional to temperature
- Temperature ratio = 1/5.11 = 0.196 (so Star A is cooler)

3. Luminosity Analysis:
- Star A is 24 times more luminous than the Sun
- Using Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L ∝ R²T⁴

4. Radius Calculation:
- L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴
- 24 = (R₁/R₂)² * (0.196)⁴
- R₁/R₂ = √(24 / (0.196)⁴)
- R₁/R₂ ≈ 0.19

5. Verification:
- 0.19 solar radii matches the calculated result
- Consistent with scientific principles
