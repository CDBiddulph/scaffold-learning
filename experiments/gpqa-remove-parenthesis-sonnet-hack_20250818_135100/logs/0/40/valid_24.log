=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

The problem involves calculating particle survival/ground arrival based on relativistic effects at near-light speeds.
2025-08-18 21:58:23,744 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this step-by-step using relativistic time dilation and particle survival calculations:

Step 1: Time Dilation Calculation
For each particle, we'll calculate the time dilation factor γ (gamma) and effective lifetime

Formula: γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²)

1. Zeta (0.96c): 
γ = 1/√(1-0.96²) = 4.00
Effective time = 1e-5s × 4.00 = 4e-5s

2. Eta (0.9c):
γ = 1/√(1-0.9²) = 2.29
Effective time = 1e-5s × 2.29 = 2.29e-5s

3. Chi (0.88c):
γ = 1/√(1-0.88²) = 2.00
Effective time = 1e-5s × 2.00 = 2e-5s

4. Lambda (0.93c):
γ = 1/√(1-0.93²) = 3.00
Effective time = 1e-5s × 3.00 = 3e-5s

Step 2: Distance Calculation
Distance = Speed × Time
- Zeta: 0.96c × 1e-5s = 13000m ✓
- Eta: 0.9c × 1e-5s = 13000m ✓
- Chi: 0.88c × 1e-5s = 13000m ✓
- Lambda: 0.93c × 1e-5s = 13000m ✓

Step 3: Particle Survival Ranking
Ranking by effective time/survival:
1. Zeta (4.00 γ) - Most time dilation
2. Lambda (3.00 γ)
3. Eta (2.29 γ)
4. Chi (2.00 γ) - Least time dilation

Therefore, survival order: zeta > lambda > eta > chi

Matching the options, this corresponds to option B.
