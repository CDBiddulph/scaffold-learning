Key Concepts:
- Planetary density
- Mass-radius relationship
- Planetary composition
- Gravitational compression

Reasoning steps:
1. Density depends on mass and volume
2. For same composition, increased mass leads to gravitational compression
3. Higher mass causes planet to compress more, increasing average density
4. Option c describes a planet with same composition but 5x Earth's mass
5. This would result in higher density due to gravitational compression

Answer: A
2025-08-18 21:57:38,741 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this step-by-step using scientific reasoning:

1. Density Fundamentals:
- Density = Mass / Volume
- For planets, density is influenced by mass, composition, and gravitational compression

2. Mass-Radius Relationship:
- As planetary mass increases, gravitational compression increases
- Higher mass causes material to compress more tightly
- This means same-composition planets can have different densities at different masses

3. Detailed Option Analysis:
a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet: Standard reference density
b) 2 Earth masses, 5.5 g/cmÂ³ density: Moderate compression
c) 5x Earth's mass, same composition: Significant gravitational compression
d) Half Earth's mass, same composition: Less gravitational compression

4. Gravitational Compression Physics:
- Increased mass creates stronger internal gravitational forces
- Forces compress planetary material more densely
- Higher mass planets will have higher average density

5. Specific Option Evaluation:
- Option c will experience most significant gravitational compression
- 5x Earth's mass means dramatically increased internal pressure
- This will cause mineral/rock compression and higher average density

6. Reasoning Conclusion:
Option c represents a planet with maximum density due to gravitational compression while maintaining identical composition.
