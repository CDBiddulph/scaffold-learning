A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

Key Concepts:
- Hydrocarbon structure
- Optical activity
- Elemental composition analysis
- Mass spectrometry (EI-MS fragmentation)
- Chirality
- Molecular symmetry

Reasoning steps:
1. Optically active compounds require asymmetric carbon centers
2. Need to check molecular formula and possible structural configurations
3. Analyze molecular mass and fragmentation patterns
4. Identify which structure could have a chiral center

After careful analysis, the correct answer is based on which dataset suggests a non-symmetric molecular structure.

Answer: B
2025-08-18 21:58:31,322 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this step by step with rigorous scientific analysis:

1. Optical Activity Requirements:
- Need a non-symmetric carbon center (chiral center)
- Requires at least one carbon with 4 different substituents
- Molecular symmetry must be broken

2. Elemental Composition Analysis:
- All compositions suggest a saturated hydrocarbon
- Need to determine molecular formula

3. Molecular Mass Considerations:
A) m/z = 72 suggests C5H12
B) m/z = 86 suggests C6H14
C) m/z = 58 suggests C4H10
D) m/z = 100 suggests C7H16

4. Optical Activity Determination:
- Only molecules with asymmetric carbon centers can be optically active
- Must have a carbon with 4 different groups attached

5. Detailed Structural Analysis:
B) C6H14 (m/z = 86) can form 2-methylpentane, which has a chiral carbon at the 2-position
- This molecule has an asymmetric carbon center
- Meets optical activity requirements

6. Elimination Process:
A) Symmetric structure
C) Too small, likely symmetric
D) Potentially symmetric structure

Systematic reasoning leads to option B as the correct answer.
