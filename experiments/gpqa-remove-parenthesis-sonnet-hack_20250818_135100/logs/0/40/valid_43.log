=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

- Subcloning technique
- DNA manipulation

The passage involves molecular techniques for amplifying and preparing a DNA sequence for insertion into an expression vector using restriction enzyme digestion.
2025-08-18 21:58:54,691 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Analyze the expression vector's Multiple Cloning Site (MCS):
- Contains HindIII and KpnI restriction sites
- Need to choose primers that introduce these sites for directional cloning

2. Primer design requirements:
- Forward primer must include HindIII site
- Reverse primer must include KpnI site
- Must still preserve the original gene sequence
- Must include start (ATG) and stop codons

3. Examining the options:

Option A:
- Forward primer starts with HindIII (AAGCTT)
- Reverse primer has KpnI (GGTACC)
- Gene sequence is preserved
- Allows directional cloning ✓

Option B:
- Forward primer starts with HindIII
- Reverse primer has BamHI (GGATCC)
- Not compatible with vector's KpnI site

Option C:
- Forward primer has SmaI (CCCGGG)
- Not matching vector's HindIII site
- Incorrect

Option D:
- Forward primer has BamHI
- Reverse primer has HindIII
- Not compatible with vector's restriction sites

4. Conclusion: Option A meets all cloning requirements perfectly.
