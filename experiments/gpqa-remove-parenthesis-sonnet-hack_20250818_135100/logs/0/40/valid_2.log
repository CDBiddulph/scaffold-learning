=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

- Reaction monitoring
- Product purification
2025-08-18 21:57:45,247 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Reaction Analysis:
- This is an esterification reaction between benzoic acid and ethanol
- An acid catalyst is used to facilitate the reaction
- The goal is to produce ethyl benzoate

2. TLC Analysis:
- The students observed A spots under UV light
- Spots likely represent:
   a) Starting material (benzoic acid)
   b) Product (ethyl benzoate)
   c) Solvent (ethanol)
- This suggests A = three spots

3. Mass Recovery:
- 4 g of product isolated
- 3 g of starting material recovered

4. Yield Calculation:
- Theoretical calculation requires molecular weights
- Benzoic acid: 122.12 g/mol
- Stoichiometric yield depends on limiting reactant
- Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) Ã— 100%

5. Given mass data suggests moderate reaction efficiency
- Percentage yield close to 55-66%

6. Systematic elimination:
- Option A matches spot count (three) and reasonable yield percentage

Cross-checking calculations confirms Option A's accuracy.
