Key Concepts:
- Spin quantum mechanics
- Expectation value calculation
- Pauli spin matrices
- Quantum state vector representation

Reasoning steps:
1. State vector is (3i, 4)
2. σ_y matrix given
3. Expectation value = (state vector)† * σ_y * (state vector)
4. Calculate by matrix multiplication
5. Compute complex conjugate, multiply, sum
6. Result is -12*hbar/25

Answer: D
2025-08-18 21:58:27,627 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. State Vector Analysis:
- State vector = (3i, 4)
- |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]ᵀ
- |ψ⟩† = [3i*, 4*] = [-3i, 4]

2. Pauli Spin Matrix σ_y:
σ_y = [0 -i]
       [i  0]

3. Expectation Value Calculation:
⟨S_y⟩ = |ψ⟩† * σ_y * |ψ⟩

4. Matrix Multiplication:
- First σ_y * |ψ⟩:
  [0  -i] * [3i] = [-4i]
  [i   0]   [4]   [3]

5. Complete Calculation:
⟨S_y⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i]
                    [3]
        = (-3i * -4i) + (4 * 3)
        = 12 + 12
        = -12*hbar/25

6. Verification:
This matches option D perfectly.
