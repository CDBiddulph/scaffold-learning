=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:58:02,750 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

Step 1: Analyze the Feynman diagram context
- In quantum field theory, loop diagrams represent quantum corrections
- The number of loops relates directly to the complexity of quantum interactions

Step 2: Examine the given expression
- alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2
- The key diagnostic feature is the denominators and overall structure

Step 3: Loop counting methodology
- In QFT, each loop introduces additional complexity
- Loop counting is often reflected in power scaling of integrals
- The 1/(4pi)^6 term suggests multiple loop contributions

Step 4: Detailed analysis
- The 1/(4pi)^6 suggests 3 loops
  - Each loop typically introduces a factor of 1/(4pi)^2
  - 6 in the denominator implies 3 loop contributions
- The (Q/M)^2 supports a multi-loop structure

Step 5: Process of elimination
- 1 loop is too simple for this complex expression
- 2 loops doesn't match the 1/(4pi)^6 scaling
- 6 loops would be excessively complex
- 3 loops perfectly matches the mathematical structure
