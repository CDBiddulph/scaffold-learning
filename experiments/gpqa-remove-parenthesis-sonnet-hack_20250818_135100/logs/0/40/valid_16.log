=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

Key Concepts:
- CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
- Transgenic modification
- Genome editing
- Embryonic microinjection
- Mosaicism
- Guide RNA targeting
- Donor DNA integration
2025-08-18 21:58:07,403 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Key Observation: Different cells in the transgenic animal have different genomic sequences - this suggests genetic mosaicism during early embryonic development.

2. Analysis of Mechanisms:
- CRISPR/Cas9 was introduced into a 1-cell fertilized egg
- Guide RNA targeted a specific sequence
- Donor DNA was also introduced
- Resulting embryo shows cells with non-uniform genetic modifications

3. Detailed Reasoning:
- Option A (cDNA conversion): Unlikely. mRNA doesn't spontaneously convert to genomic DNA during embryogenesis.
- Option B (RNA-DNA complex integration): Technically improbable. Integration requires specific molecular mechanisms.
- Option C (Surrogate DNA contamination): Incorrect. No mechanism suggests maternal DNA random integration.
- Option D (Continuous Cas9 cutting): MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION

4. Scientific Explanation for Option D:
- During early embryonic cell divisions, Cas9 might continue cutting target sites
- Each cell division provides opportunities for donor DNA integration
- Incomplete or asynchronous integration leads to mosaic genetic modifications
- Different cell lineages receive different genetic edits

5. Mechanism Verification:
- Cas9's ongoing activity during early embryogenesis
- Stochastic nature of DNA integration
- Variation in editing efficiency across cell divisions

6. Conclusion: The continuous DNA cutting by Cas9 provides the most probable mechanism for generating genetic mosaicism.
