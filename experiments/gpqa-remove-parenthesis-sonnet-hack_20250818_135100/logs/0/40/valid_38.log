Key Concepts:
- Cope rearrangement (sigmatropic rearrangement)
- Stereochemistry
- Molecular orbital theory
- Concerted [3,3] rearrangement
- Thermal pericyclic reaction

The problem requires understanding how a specific azabicyclic molecule will reorganize its bonds and stereochemistry through a thermal Cope rearrangement.
2025-08-18 21:58:50,630 [INFO] LLM reasoning and response: Let's solve this systematically:

Step 1: Analyze the Starting Molecule
- (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene is a bicyclic azacyclic compound
- Contains a vinyl group and an azabicycle
- Stereochemistry is specified as (1S,4R)

Step 2: Understand Cope Rearrangement Principles
- Thermal [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement
- Involves concerted electron reorganization
- Preserves stereochemical relationships
- Shifts double bonds and substituents

Step 3: Predict Rearrangement Mechanism
- The vinyl group and adjacent double bond will migrate
- A concerted 6-electron system rearrangement occurs
- Maintains stereochemical configuration

Step 4: Evaluate Possible Products
- Focuses on cyclopenta[c]pyridine derivatives
- Requires maintaining original molecular connectivity
- Considers substituent positioning

Step 5: Systematic Option Evaluation
A) 4,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine - Incorrect connectivity
B) 4,4a,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine - Incorrect substituent positions
C) 4,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine - Matches rearrangement expectations
D) 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine - Incorrect substituent positions

Step 6: Confirm Option C
- Correct stereochemical rearrangement
- Maintains original molecular framework
- Reflects expected Cope rearrangement outcome
