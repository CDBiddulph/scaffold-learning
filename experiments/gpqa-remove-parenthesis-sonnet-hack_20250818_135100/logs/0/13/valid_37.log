=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:26,436 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's decode the clues in the problem statement:
   - Two point particles
   - Smallest attainable charge
   - Smallest attainable mass
   - Separated by 137 meters
   - Experiencing both attractive and repulsive forces

2) The "smallest attainable charge" suggests an elementary particle interaction.

3) The key observation is the distance: 137 meters.

4) This specific number 137 is extremely significant in physics. It's the fine structure constant (Î±), approximately 1/137.

5) The fine structure constant relates electromagnetic interactions and emerges in quantum electrodynamics.

6) The problem seems to be hinting at the relative strengths of fundamental forces at this specific distance.

7) The ratio of forces is precisely the value of the fine structure constant.

8) This means the ratio of repulsive to attractive force strength is 1/137.

9) Looking at the given options, this corresponds to option A.

10) The steps:
    - Recognize the significance of 137
    - Understand it represents the fine structure constant
    - Note this relates to force interaction strengths
    - Match the numerical value to the options

11) This problem tests understanding of fundamental physics constants and their meaning.
