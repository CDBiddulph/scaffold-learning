All the following statements about the molecular biology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) are correct except




A) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates. 
B SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. 
C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

D) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

2025-08-18 21:16:46,965 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step-by-step:

A) This statement appears scientifically sound. The description of pseudoknot conformations and frameshifting rates for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seems consistent with current molecular biology understanding.

B) This statement is correct. The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is known to function as a heterodimer in mismatch repair, with nsp10 acting as a cofactor for nsp14's exonuclease activity, helping to maintain genomic fidelity.

C) This statement accurately describes the mechanism of ORF3a-induced apoptosis through caspase-8 activation via the extrinsic pathway, without affecting Bcl-2 levels. This is consistent with current research on SARS-CoV-2 molecular mechanisms.

D) This statement contains a subtle but significant inaccuracy. While programmed ribosomal frameshifting is correct, the claim that "SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting" is not entirely accurate.

Research has shown that while there are similarities, there are also important differences in the frameshifting mechanisms between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The pseudoknot structures and frameshifting efficiencies are not identical.

The key issue is the blanket statement of "mostly the same conformation," which oversimplifies the molecular differences between these two coronaviruses.

Therefore, statement D appears to be the incorrect statement.
