=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

2025-08-18 21:16:31,999 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the decay probability given:
   - 32% chance of decay within 100 minutes
   - 50 minutes have already passed without decay

2) This suggests the decay follows an exponential probability distribution

3) Let P(t) be the probability of decay by time t
   - P(100) = 0.32
   - We want to find P(200) | given no decay by 50 minutes

4) Key probabilistic principle: Conditional probability
   - We want P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes)

5) By conditional probability rule:
   P = [P(decay by 200 minutes) - P(decay by 50 minutes)] / [1 - P(decay by 50 minutes)]

6) Estimate decay probabilities:
   - At 50 minutes: P(50) = 1 - [1 - 0.32]^(50/100) = 0.16
   - At 200 minutes: P(200) = 1 - [1 - 0.32]^(200/100) = 0.56

7) Plugging into conditional probability formula:
   P = [0.56 - 0.16] / [1 - 0.16] = 0.40 = 40%

8) This matches option D
