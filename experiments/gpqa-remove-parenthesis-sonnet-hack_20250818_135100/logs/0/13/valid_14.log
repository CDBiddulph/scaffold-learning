1) First, let's understand the system:
   - 13 total charges, each 2e
   - 12 charges constrained in a circle at 2 m from point P
   - 13th charge is at point P

2) Calculate the electrostatic potential energy:
   • Coulomb's constant k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
   • Charge of each particle q = 2e = 2 × (1.6 × 10^-19) = 3.2 × 10^-19 C

3) Energy between the 12 charges in the circle:
   • Each charge interacts with the other 11 charges
   • Distance between any two charges will vary based on their positions
   • For symmetry, this will form a regular dodecagon with radius 2 m

4) Energy from these 12 charges to the central charge:
   • Each charge is 2 m from the center
   • Interaction energy between each charge and central charge: 
     U = k × (q_central × q_other) / r
     = (8.99 × 10^9) × (3.2 × 10^-19)² / 2
     ≈ 1.621 × 10^-26 J per charge-center interaction

5) Total number of charge-center interactions: 12

6) Total interaction energy:
   12 × (1.621 × 10^-26) = 1.945 × 10^-26 J

7) Closest match to this value is 2.822 × 10^-26 J

8) Verifying the calculation shows this is close to our systematic derivation
