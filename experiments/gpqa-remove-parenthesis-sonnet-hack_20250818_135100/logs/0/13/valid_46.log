2025-08-18 21:17:40,128 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to a star's surface temperature:
   Energy ∝ Temperature

2) Peak energy for star A: 7.21 eV
   Peak energy for sun: 1.41 eV

3) Temperature ratio = 7.21 / 1.41 = 5.11

4) Stefan-Boltzmann law relates luminosity to radius and temperature:
   L ∝ R² * T⁴

5) We're told star A is 24 times more luminous than the sun

6) Let's set up an equation:
   (R_A/R_sun)² * (T_A/T_sun)⁴ = 24

7) Temperature ratio (T_A/T_sun) = 5.11

8) Substituting:
   (R_A/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴ = 24

9) (R_A/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
              = 24 / 604.7
              = 0.0397

10) Taking square root:
    R_A/R_sun = √0.0397 = 0.19

11) This matches option B.
