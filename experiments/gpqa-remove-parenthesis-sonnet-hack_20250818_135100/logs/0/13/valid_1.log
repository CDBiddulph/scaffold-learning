=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

1. Caesium-137 Decay Characteristics:
- Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope
- Half-life is approximately 30 years
- Decays by beta emission, but also emits gamma rays
- Decay constant (λ) can be calculated from half-life

2. Number of Atoms:
- Total atoms = 10^17 atoms

3. Gamma Ray Detection Considerations:
- Detector size: 2 x 3 cm = 6 cm²
- Distance from material: 4 meters
- Detection time: 80 minutes

4. Calculate Solid Angle:
- Solid angle = (Detector Area) / (4πr²)
- Detector area = 6 cm² = 0.0006 m²
- Distance = 4 m
- Solid angle ≈ 0.0006 / (4π * 16) ≈ 3 × 10^-6 steradians

5. Gamma Ray Emission Rate:
- Not directly given, but can estimate
- Typically, about 0.85 gamma rays per decay
- Detection probability depends on solid angle

6. Rough Calculation:
- Estimated gamma rays detected = 10^17 * 0.85 * (3 × 10^-6)
- This yields approximately 10^5 to 10^6 gamma rays

7. Comparing with Answer Choices:
- Closest match is 1 million (10^6)
