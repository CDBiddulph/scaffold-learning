=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:23,729 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the given information:
- Satellites in low Earth orbit have detected astronomical objects
- Localization precision is 100-200 arc minutes
- The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Analyzing the localization precision:
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively wide range
- This suggests the objects could be quite distant
- Precision this broad indicates objects not very close to Earth

3. Evaluating the distance options:
A) 1 million or 1 billion light years
   - These are extremely large distances
   - Very far beyond our galaxy
   - Consistent with wide localization precision

B) 1,000 or 100,000 light years
   - Within our galaxy's scale
   - Reasonable range for astronomical objects
   - Consistent with low Earth orbit detection

C) 10 or 100 light years
   - Very close to Earth
   - Too near to match the broad localization precision

D) 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - Far too close
   - Within our solar system
   - Inconsistent with satellite detection and precision

4. Conclusion:
Option B provides the most scientifically plausible range of distances.
