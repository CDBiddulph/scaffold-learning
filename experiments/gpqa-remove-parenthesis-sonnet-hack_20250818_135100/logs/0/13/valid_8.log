What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
B 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-18 21:16:34,669 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write out the dissociation equilibrium:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5 × 10¹⁰

3) We know the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that dissociate

5) We can set up the equilibrium expression:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

6) Rearranging this equation:
   x² = Kf × (0.02 - x)

7) Since Kf is very large (5 × 10¹⁰), we can assume x is very small compared to 0.02
   x² = (5 × 10¹⁰) × 0.02

8) Solving for x:
   x = √((5 × 10¹⁰) × 0.02)
   x = √(1 × 10¹⁰)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

9) This corresponds to the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions

10) Looking at the given options, this matches option B.
