=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate motherâ€™s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 21:16:53,001 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the scenario:
- A scientist performed genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 in a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The editing was done at the very early stage of embryonic development
- Different tissues have different genomic sequences after development

2. Analyzing the key biological process:
- At early embryonic stages, cells are rapidly dividing and differentiating
- If genetic modification occurs unevenly or at different times during cell division, some cells might be edited while others are not

3. Evaluating the options:

A) Converting mRNA to cDNA and genome incorporation - Unlikely, as this is not a standard mechanism during CRISPR editing.

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation - Also unlikely, as CRISPR primarily works through DNA cutting and repair.

C) Surrogate mother's DNA incorporation - Not a plausible mechanism for genetic variation.

D) Continuous Cas9 cutting and donor DNA incorporation at different stages:
- This is the most probable explanation
- Cas9 might continue to be active during early embryonic cell divisions
- Some cells might get edited while others remain unmodified
- This would lead to genetic mosaicism, where different tissues have different genomic sequences

4. Conclusion:
The continuous cutting and incorporation of donor DNA at different embryonic development stages would most likely cause the observed genomic variations.
