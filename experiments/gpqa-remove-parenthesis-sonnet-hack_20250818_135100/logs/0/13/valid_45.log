=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

2025-08-18 21:17:39,931 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Initial mixture conditions:
- Volume ratio (A+B):C = 1:2.25
- Volume ratio A:B = 1:1

2) Let's first assign volumes:
- If A:B = 1:1, let A = x, B = x
- (A+B):C = 1:2.25
- (x+x):C = 1:2.25
- 2x:C = 1:2.25
- C = 2x × 2.25/1 = 4.5x

3) Density relationship:
- Density of A and B differ by factor of 2.11
- This suggests A and B are different gases with similar volumes

4) Key observation: Reaction produces water and HHal acid

5) Most probable scenario:
- If A and B have similar volumes but different densities
- They are likely hydrogen and a halogen (like H2 and Cl2)
- The reaction would produce HHal acid and water

6) Reaction likely: H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl + H2O

7) Volume proportions:
- H2 (A): x
- Cl2 (B): x
- C (initial): 4.5x

8) Product mass calculation:
- HCl mass would be proportional to its volume
- HCl volume is 2x/total initial volume

9) Mass fraction calculation:
(2x) / (4.5x + 2x) × 100% = 2 / 6.5 × 100% = 35.0%
