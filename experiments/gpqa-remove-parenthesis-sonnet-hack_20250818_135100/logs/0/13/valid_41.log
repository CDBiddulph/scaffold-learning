1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
- Energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength
- Different colors correspond to different energy ranges in the visible spectrum

2) The dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which means it has absorbed a complementary color

3) To determine the absorbed color, we need to understand the color wheel and complementary colors:
- Blue and orange are complementary colors
- Violet and yellow are complementary colors
- Red and green are complementary colors

4) Energy of light is given by E = hc/λ, where:
- h is Planck's constant
- c is speed of light
- λ is wavelength

5) 2.3393 eV suggests a color in the yellow-green region of the visible spectrum

6) Complementary to yellow is violet
- When a compound absorbs yellow light, it will appear violet
- This occurs because the absorbed color is subtracted from white light, leaving the complementary color visible

7) By the process of elimination and color theory principles, violet is the absorbed color
