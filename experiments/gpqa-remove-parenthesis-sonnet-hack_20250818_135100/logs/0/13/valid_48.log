=== INPUT ===
In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.
C One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
D) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:43,563 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Polymer Branching Context:
- The goal is to create a polymer with regular branches
- Only ethylene will be used as the monomer
- A dual catalyst system is required

2. Analyzing the Senior Scientist's Statements:
A) "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US"
- This seems plausible and likely true based on advanced polymer engineering techniques

B) "Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step"
- This suggests specific limitations in catalyst activation mechanisms
- The statement sounds precise and technically informed

C) "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators"
- Group VIa transition metals include Cr, Mo, W
- These metals are known for complex polymerization chemistry
- The statement suggests a viable technical approach

D) "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive"
- While noble metals can catalyze reactions, the expense argument weakens this statement

3. Technical Reasoning:
- The statement about aluminum activators not working suggests specific mechanistic constraints
- The technical precision of statement B indicates it's likely the most accurate

4. Conclusion:
Statement B appears most technically credible and specific about the catalyst system's limitations.
