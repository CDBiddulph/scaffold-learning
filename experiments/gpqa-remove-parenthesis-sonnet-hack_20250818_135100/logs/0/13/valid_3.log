1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. Remember that volume depends on radius cubed.

2. Option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
- This is essentially identical to Earth's density
- Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³
- No change in density

3. Option b (2 Earth masses, 5.5 g/cm³):
- Specified density is already 5.5 g/cm³
- Direct statement, no calculation needed

4. Option c (Same composition, 5x Earth's mass):
- If composition is same, density remains constant
- Mass increases, but volume increases proportionally
- Density = constant ≈ 5.5 g/cm³

5. Option d (Same composition, 1/2 Earth's mass):
- Same composition means density would remain constant
- Mass and volume are proportionally reduced
- Density remains ≈ 5.5 g/cm³

6. Comparing options:
- Options a, c, and d have the same density
- Option b explicitly states 5.5 g/cm³

7. Therefore, option b has the most precisely defined density.
