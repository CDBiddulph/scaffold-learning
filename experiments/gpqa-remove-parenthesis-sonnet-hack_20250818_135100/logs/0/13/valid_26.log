1) First, recall the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:
   S = kA/(4l_p²)
   Where:
   - k is Boltzmann's constant
   - A is the surface area of the event horizon
   - l_p is the Planck length

2) To find the area, we need the radius of the event horizon. We'll use the angular size.

3) Angular size formula: θ = 2 * arctan(R/d)
   Here, θ = 10^-17 degrees, d = 10^10 parsecs

4) Rearranging the formula:
   R = d * tan(θ/2)

5) Approximating tan(θ/2) ≈ θ/2 for very small angles:
   R ≈ (10^10 parsecs) * (10^-17/2)
     ≈ 10^-7 parsecs
     ≈ 10^15 meters

6) Surface area of event horizon:
   A = 4πR²
     ≈ 4π * (10^15)²
     ≈ 10^32 m²

7) Bekenstein-Hawking entropy:
   S ≈ (k * 10^32) / (4 * (10^-35)²)
     ≈ 10^62 J/K

8) This matches option C.
