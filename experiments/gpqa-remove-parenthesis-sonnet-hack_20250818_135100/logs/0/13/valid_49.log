=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-18 21:17:46,210 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material is bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
- This is a bicyclic ketone with a rigid ring structure

2. UV irradiation forms product 1
- The molecular weight remains the same
- This suggests a photochemical rearrangement, likely a hydrogen abstraction or photochemical ring opening/closure
- Most probable: Norrish Type II reaction, where a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon abstracts to form a new structure

3. Pd/C hydrogenation of product 1 forms product 2
- This suggests reduction of a functional group
- Since the starting material was a ketone, product 2 is likely a fully saturated alcohol or alkane

4. Analyzing the most deshielded hydrogen in product 2
- In a saturated bicyclic system, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near the former ketone position
- This hydrogen would have different neighboring hydrogens due to the rigid ring structure
- This suggests a splitting pattern that reflects non-equivalent neighboring hydrogens

5. The splitting pattern would depend on the number of adjacent non-equivalent hydrogens
- The most probable scenario is two non-equivalent neighboring hydrogens
- This would result in a doublet of doublets

Therefore, the most deshielded hydrogen would show a doublet of doublets in the 1H NMR spectrum.
