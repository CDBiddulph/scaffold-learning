=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 21:17:13,863 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. For a hydrocarbon to be optically active, it must:
- Have a chiral carbon center (asymmetric carbon)
- Not have any plane of symmetry
- Have different substituents on the carbon

2. Let's analyze the molecular formulas:
- Using elemental composition, calculate molecular formulas
- A: C5H12 (pentane)
- B: C6H14 (hexane)
- C: C4H8 (butene or cyclobutane)
- D: C7H16 (heptane)

3. Optical activity requirements:
- Need at least one asymmetric/chiral carbon
- Requires substituents different enough to create chirality

4. Molecular structure considerations:
- Option B (C6H14/hexane) has potential chiral isomers like 3-methylpentane
- This molecule has an asymmetric carbon at the 3-position
- 3-methylpentane has non-superimposable mirror images (chiral)

5. Electron Impact Mass Spectrometry (EI-MS) fragments are consistent with hexane structure

Therefore, the optically active saturated hydrocarbon is hexane (3-methylpentane).
