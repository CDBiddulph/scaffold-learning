=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:16:51,577 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1) In Feynman diagram calculations, the number of loops is directly related to the power of certain dimensionless parameters in the loop expansion.

2) The most common parameter that scales with loop count is the loop integrand's dimensional scaling.

3) Let's look at the symbolic expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2

4) The crucial clue is the 1/(4pi)^6 term, which suggests multiple loop contributions.

5) In quantum field theory, each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4pi)^2 to the integral.

6) We see (1/(4pi)^6), which is (1/(4pi)^2)^3.

7) This suggests the power corresponds to 3 loops.

8) The mathematical structure and power dependence strongly point to a 3-loop diagram.

9) Checking the given options, 3 loops corresponds to option D.

Answer: D

Rationale: The 1/(4pi)^6 factor in the symbolic expression indicates a 3-loop diagram, representing the cubic power of the loop integration factor 1/(4pi)^2.
