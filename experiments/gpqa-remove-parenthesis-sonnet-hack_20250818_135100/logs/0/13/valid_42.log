=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

A Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:35,371 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Understanding the Problem:
- The student is studying a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrocarbon reaction
- Current conditions: 300°C
- Goal: Increase reactant conversion without losing selectivity
- Previous attempts (more catalyst, changing catalyst composition) failed

2. Scientific Analysis:
- Temperature significantly affects reaction kinetics
- Different temperature ranges can impact:
  a) Reaction rate
  b) Conversion
  c) Potential side reactions like polymerization

3. Key Considerations:
- Lowering temperature typically:
  - Reduces reaction rate
  - Can potentially decrease unwanted side reactions
- Increasing temperature typically:
  - Increases reaction rate
  - Can promote side reactions or polymerization

4. Critical Warning Sign:
- The problem mentions "possible polymerization of one of the products"

5. Detailed Option Analysis:
- Option A: Defeatist approach, not scientific
- Option B: Decreases temperature, might reduce conversion
- Option C: Thoughtful approach - decreases temperature AND considers polymerization risk
- Option D: Increases temperature, which contradicts goal of preventing polymerization

6. Reasoning Conclusion:
Option C is the most scientifically sound approach:
- Systematically investigates temperature impact
- Considers potential polymerization risk
- Maintains scientific rigor and experimental methodology
