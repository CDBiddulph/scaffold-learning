2025-08-18 21:16:47,923 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory):
- This is a framework for understanding physics beyond the Standard Model
- It introduces higher-dimensional operators to parametrize potential new physics
- Must respect fundamental symmetry principles

2. Let's analyze each symmetry systematically:

Lorentz Symmetry:
- Fundamental to relativistic quantum field theories
- Describes how physics looks the same in different reference frames
- SMEFT MUST respect this ✓

Poincaré Symmetry:
- Combines Lorentz symmetry with translations
- Essential for maintaining relativistic invariance
- SMEFT must respect this ✓

CP Symmetry:
- Combination of charge conjugation and parity
- Not strictly required in SMEFT
- Can be violated by certain operators ✗

CPT Symmetry:
- Fundamental quantum field theory theorem
- Combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal
- Must be respected by ALL quantum field theories
- SMEFT must respect this ✓

3. Checking the requirements:
- Lorentz Symmetry: Required ✓
- Poincaré Symmetry: Required ✓
- CPT Symmetry: Required ✓

Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 must be respected.
