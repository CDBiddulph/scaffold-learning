=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 21:17:30,899 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Context of the experiment:
- ChIP-seq with IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells
- Peak differences between PFA and PFA+DSG fixation methods

2. Understanding fixation methods:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) typically provides light crosslinking
- PFA+DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) provides more extensive/stronger crosslinking

3. What causes peaks to "disappear":
- More extensive crosslinking likely disrupts or masks certain protein-DNA interactions
- This suggests the original peaks were at sites with more transient or weak interactions

4. Characteristics of transient protein-DNA interactions:
- Most likely to occur at dynamic regulatory regions
- Active promoters and enhancers are sites of frequent transcription factor binding
- These regions have rapid protein turnover and less stable interactions

5. Reasoning for active promoters/enhancers:
- Transcription factors like IKAROS frequently bind and release at these sites
- Interactions are often weak and dynamic
- More extensive crosslinking would more likely disrupt these transient interactions

6. Excluding other options:
- Random locations: Unlikely to show systematic disappearance
- Repeats: Less specific binding dynamics
- Introns: Generally less transcription factor binding activity

Based on this systematic analysis, the peaks most likely to disappear are at active promoters and enhancers.
