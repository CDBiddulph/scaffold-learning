=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:22,245 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Hi-C Results:
- Detected significant interaction between 5kb bins
- Contains an active promoter and active enhancer
- Linear distance ~1 Mb apart
- High confidence interaction signal

2. FISH Results:
- Could NOT validate the Hi-C interaction
- Suggests potential discrepancy in interaction detection

3. Functional Evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB targeting the enhancer reduced promoter expression by ~20%
- This implies a genuine functional interaction exists

4. Analysis of Potential Reasons:
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH: 
- Less likely, since Hi-C showed high confidence signal
- Functional effect from KRAB targeting suggests real interaction

B) Structural variation affecting linear distance:
- Possible explanation
- Structural variations could create non-linear chromosome conformations
- Would explain why FISH (which measures linear distance) fails

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH:
- 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH
- Not a plausible explanation

D) Hi-C false-positive:
- Less likely given functional validation by KRAB experiment

5. Conclusion:
Structural variations creating non-linear chromosome interactions best explains the discrepancy.
