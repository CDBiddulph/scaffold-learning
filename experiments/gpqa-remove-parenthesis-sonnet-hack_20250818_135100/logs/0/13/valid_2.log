=== INPUT ===
In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:16:28,615 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand the TLC analysis:
- TLC revealed 3 spots under UV light
- This suggests the presence of:
   a) Starting material
   b) Product
   c) Solvent

2. After column chromatography (CC), they separated:
- 4 g of product
- 3 g of starting material

3. To calculate percentage yield, we need to determine the theoretical yield:
- We start with 10 g of benzoic acid
- Since 4 g of product was obtained, this is the actual yield

4. Percentage yield calculation:
Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100%
                  = (4 g / 10 g) × 100%
                  = 0.4 × 100%
                  = 40%

5. Comparing this with the given options:
- Number of TLC spots: 3
- Percentage yield: 44.44%

6. Checking the options, we see option C matches these criteria:
- A = three
- B = 44.44%
