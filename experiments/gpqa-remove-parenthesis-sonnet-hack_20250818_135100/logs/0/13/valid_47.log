=== INPUT ===
For multi-Higgs-doublet models, do the Breit-Weigner corrections of the Oblique Parameters provide a better constraint on New Physics than the Original Oblique Parameters?

A) No, Oblique Parameters without Breit-Wigner corrections provide a better constraint on New Physics.
B) Yes, there is a big difference.
C) Yes, but it depends on the masses of the charged scalars.
D No, there is no difference.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:42,359 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the Context:
- Multi-Higgs-doublet models (MHDM) are extensions of the Standard Model with multiple Higgs doublets
- Oblique Parameters are quantum corrections that characterize electroweak precision tests
- Breit-Wigner corrections relate to resonance phenomena in quantum field theory

2. Assessing Constraints:
- Breit-Wigner corrections can provide additional information about quantum corrections
- In MHDM, these corrections can refine measurements of electroweak parameters
- The constraints depend on the specific structure of the Higgs sector

3. Analyzing the Physical Implications:
- The charged scalar masses are critical in determining the significance of Breit-Wigner corrections
- Different mass ranges can lead to varying impacts on the Oblique Parameters
- This suggests the corrections' effectiveness is mass-dependent

4. Evaluating the Options:
- Option A suggests original parameters are better
- Option B claims a significant difference
- Option C indicates the mass dependence is crucial
- Option D suggests no difference exists

5. Conclusion:
- The mass of charged scalars determines the effectiveness of Breit-Wigner corrections
- This implies the constraint's strength varies with the specific model parameters
