=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:02,789 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step by analyzing the substituent effects on electrophilic aromatic substitution:

1) The key factor is the directing effect of substituents on para vs. ortho substitution.

2) Let's classify the substituents by their electronic effects:
• Electron-donating groups (activating): promote substitution, favor para position
• Electron-withdrawing groups (deactivating): inhibit substitution, reduce para yield

3) Detailed substituent analysis:
• C6H5-CH3 (toluene): Strong electron-donating group, strongly promotes para
• C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene): Similar to methyl, strongly promotes para
• C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene): Weak electron-withdrawing, para yield is moderate
• C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate): Strongly electron-withdrawing, reduces para yield
• C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid): Very electron-withdrawing, very low para yield
• C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene): Strongly electron-withdrawing, virtually blocks substitution

4) Ordering from lowest to highest para yield:
Nitrobenzene (lowest) → Benzoic acid → Ethyl benzoate → Chlorobenzene → Toluene → Ethylbenzene (highest)

5) This matches option C: 4<2<6<3<1<5
