=== INPUT ===
Read the following passage on Wnt3a signaling pathway in humans to answer the subsequent question.

The Wnt3a, a secreted glycoprotein ligand binds the N-terminal extra-cellular domain of its transmembrane receptor protein frizzled and together with co-receptor LRP5/6, lead to the transduction of signaling cascades that regulate an array of cellular processes including, cell proliferation, differentiation and release of intracellular calcium. Beta-catenin is a crucial protein in this signaling pathway, it accumulates in cytoplasm following the ligand binding and is eventually translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Beta-catenin functions as a transcriptional co-activator where it directly binds to DNA together with other factors to initiate transcription of target genes. Without the non-canonical Wnt3a ligand binding, Beta-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, instead it is targeted by a destruction complex that leads to proteasomal degradation.

Which of the following group of words/phrases from the passage contains correct terms ONLY in regards to the above signaling pathway?


A) Translocation into nucleus, intracellular calcium, destruction complex, frizzled
B) Proteosomal degradation, N-terminal extracellular, frizzled, non-canonical.
C) Beta-catenin, directly binds DNA, LRP5/6, transmembrane receptor protein.
D Transcriptional co-activator, glycoprotein, accumulation in cytoplasm, Beta-catenin

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:12,542 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll review the specific terms and concepts in the Wnt3a signaling pathway from the passage:

2. Checking the key terms and their scientific validity:
- Translocation into nucleus: ✓ Correct term
- Intracellular calcium: ✓ Correct term
- Destruction complex: ✓ Correct term
- Frizzled: ✓ Correct term

3. Option A contains ALL of these scientifically accurate terms

4. Let's cross-check other options:
- Option B: Contains some correct terms but also includes "non-canonical" and "proteosomal" (slightly misspelled)
- Option C: Contains some accurate terms like Beta-catenin and LRP5/6
- Option D: Contains some accurate terms like transcriptional co-activator and Beta-catenin

5. The key requirement is a group with ONLY correct terms related to the Wnt3a signaling pathway

6. Option A stands out as having all scientifically accurate, pathway-specific terms

By systematic analysis of the scientific terminology in the passage and each option, I conclude the answer is:

Answer: A
