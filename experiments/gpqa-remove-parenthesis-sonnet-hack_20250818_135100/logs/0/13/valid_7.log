=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 21:16:34,222 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the C-NOT gate condition:
   - The control qubit must be in the state |0⟩
   - In the given input, the first qubit is (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩)
   - The second qubit is |0⟩

2) The C-NOT gate's operation:
   - If the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged
   - If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit would be flipped

3) In this case, the control qubit is a superposition, but the coefficient of |1⟩ is in a CNOT
   - When control is |0⟩, the state remains the same
   - The second qubit remains |0⟩

4) Carefully examining the given options:
   - Option A has the SAME state as the input
   - This matches exactly with the CNOT gate operation when the control is |0⟩

5) Therefore, the output will be:
   U_{C-NOT}|ψ⟩ = (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

Answer: A

Key reasoning points:
- C-NOT gate preserves state when control is |0⟩
- The state of the first qubit is kept intact
- The second qubit remains |0⟩
