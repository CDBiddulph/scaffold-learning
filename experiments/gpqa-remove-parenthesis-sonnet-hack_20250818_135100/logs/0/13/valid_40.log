=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory.

2025-08-18 21:17:30,875 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, let's understand the problem:
   - We have a light beam propagating through a moving glass medium
   - The glass moves at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam
   - The glass has refractive index n
   - Speed of light in vacuum is given as c = 1

2) This scenario involves the relativistic velocity transformation for light in a moving medium

3) The standard relativistic velocity transformation formula for light in a moving medium is:
   v_observed = (v_light in medium + v_medium) / (1 + (v_light in medium * v_medium)/cÂ²)

4) In our case, v_light in medium = 1/n (since speed of light in glass is c/n)

5) Substituting this into the velocity transformation formula:
   v_observed = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v))

6) Algebraically manipulating this:
   = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)
   = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)

7) Checking the given options, this exactly matches option D

8) Verification confirms the relativistic velocity transformation is correctly applied

Answer: D

Key insights:
- Used relativistic velocity transformation
- Carefully tracked frame of reference transformations
- Algebraically simplified the expression
- Matched the result to the given options
