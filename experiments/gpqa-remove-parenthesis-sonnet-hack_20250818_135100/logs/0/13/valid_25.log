=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 21:17:07,695 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the constraints:
- The wave function is time-independent
- The wave function is spherically symmetric
- The wave function's imaginary part is zero
- Inner sphere radius is d1
- Outer sphere radius is 100*d1

2) Probability conditions:
- Probability of finding particle between d1 and 2*d1 is P
- Probability of finding particle between 2*d1 and 3*d1 is also P

3) Let the wave function be of the form f(r), where r is distance from center

4) For a spherically symmetric wave function, the probability of finding particle in a shell is proportional to:
- The volume of the shell
- The square of the wave function

5) Volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r²

6) For the probabilities to be equal in the two specified regions, the wave function must decrease in a way that cancels out the r² volume factor

7) This implies the wave function must be proportional to 1/r

8) This ensures that P(r) * r² remains constant for different shells

Therefore, the wave function has the form 1/r.
