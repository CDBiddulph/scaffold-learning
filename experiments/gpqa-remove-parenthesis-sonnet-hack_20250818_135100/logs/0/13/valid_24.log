=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:17:06,659 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how far each particle will travel in 1e-5 seconds:
• Distance = Speed × Time
• Starting height: 13000m

2. For zeta (0.96c):
• Speed = 0.96 × 3 × 10^8 m/s = 2.88 × 10^8 m/s
• Distance = 2.88 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 2880m
• Reaches ground? Yes

3. For eta (0.9c):
• Speed = 0.9 × 3 × 10^8 m/s = 2.7 × 10^8 m/s
• Distance = 2.7 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 2700m
• Reaches ground? Yes

4. For chi (0.88c):
• Speed = 0.88 × 3 × 10^8 m/s = 2.64 × 10^8 m/s
• Distance = 2.64 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 2640m
• Reaches ground? Yes

5. For lambda (0.93c):
• Speed = 0.93 × 3 × 10^8 m/s = 2.79 × 10^8 m/s
• Distance = 2.79 × 10^8 m/s × 1e-5 s = 2790m
• Reaches ground? Yes

6. Ordering by distance traveled (from highest to lowest):
zeta > lambda > eta > chi

This matches option B.
