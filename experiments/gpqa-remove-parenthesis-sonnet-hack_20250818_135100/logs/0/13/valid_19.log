=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

1) First, recall the equilibrium temperature formula:
   T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * (R/a)^(1/2)
   Where A = albedo, R = planet radius, a = orbital distance

2) Given:
   - Albedo is constant (0.3) for all planets
   - Temperature ratio Planet1:Planet2 = 1.4
   - Temperature ratio Planet2:Planet3 = 2.3
   - Mass ratio Planet1:Planet2 = 1.15
   - Mass ratio Planet2:Planet3 = 1.35

3) The orbital period (P) relates to semi-major axis (a) by Kepler's third law:
   P^2 ∝ a^3

4) From temperature ratios, we can infer relative orbital distances
   Temperature is proportional to a^(-1/2)
   So orbital distance would be proportional to T^(-2)

5) Let's calculate orbital period ratios:
   - T(Planet1)/T(Planet2) ∝ (1.4)^(-2) ≈ 0.51
   - T(Planet2)/T(Planet3) ∝ (2.3)^(-2) ≈ 0.19

6) Multiplying these gives orbital period ratio for Planet3:Planet1
   0.51 * 0.19 ≈ 0.097

7) Taking the reciprocal gives Planet1:Planet3 period ratio as ≈ 10.4
