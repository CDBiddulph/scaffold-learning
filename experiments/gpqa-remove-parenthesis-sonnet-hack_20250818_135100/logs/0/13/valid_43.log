=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 21:17:35,850 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, I'll examine the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) in the expression vector:
- Contains HindIII and KpnI sites
- These are unique sites suitable for directional cloning

2. I'll look for corresponding restriction sites in the DNA sequence:
- The sequence MUST have sites matching HindIII and KpnI
- These sites will allow one-way orientation of the insert

3. Check the primer sequences for these sites:
- Option A uses HindIII (AAGCTT) at 5' end and KpnI (GGTACC) at 3' end
- Primer sequences add the restriction sites to PCR product

4. Verify insert orientation:
- 5' primer starts with HindIII site (AAGCTT) before start codon
- 3' primer has KpnI site (GGTACC) at end of sequence
- This ensures correct directional cloning into vector's MCS

5. Other critical checks:
- Primers flank entire coding sequence
- Added restriction sites don't disrupt reading frame
- Primers have complementary regions to template

Option A perfectly meets all requirements.
