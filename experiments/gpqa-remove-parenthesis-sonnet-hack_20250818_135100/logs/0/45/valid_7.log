=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

1) First, let's understand the C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate:
   - It flips the target qubit only if the control qubit is |1‚ü©
   - In this case, the condition is that the...
