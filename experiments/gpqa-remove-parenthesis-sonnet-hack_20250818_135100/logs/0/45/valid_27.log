=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

2025-08-18 22:06:58,622 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The expectation value of spin along y-direction is calculated by:
   <S_y> = ψ* σ_y ψ

2) The given state is (3i, 4)
   ψ = [3i, 4]^T (transposed column vector)

3) ...
