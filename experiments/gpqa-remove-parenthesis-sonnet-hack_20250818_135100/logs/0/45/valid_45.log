=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

A 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 22:07:28,153 [INFO] LLM response received: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Initial Conditions:
- Volume ratio (A+B):C = 1:2.25
- Volume ratio of A:B = 1:1
- The reaction produces water and HHal acid

2. Let's assume volumes:
- A = x
- B =...
