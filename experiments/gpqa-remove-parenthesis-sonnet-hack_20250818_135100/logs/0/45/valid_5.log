=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

B 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

1) First, recall the formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude:

   Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * ∑(2l+1)sin(δ_l)exp(iδ_l)

   where k is the wave number ...
