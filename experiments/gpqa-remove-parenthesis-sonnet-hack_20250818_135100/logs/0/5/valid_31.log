Which of the following sequences is correctly ordered by their distance from the Sun? When a parameter is not mentioned, assume it is zero. For the stars in the Solar Neighborhood (distance < 500 pc), assume that the total absorption in the V band relates to the color excess of the B-V color with an Rv value of 3.1.


a) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magnitude of 8 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
b) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
c) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 9 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag
d) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 8 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
e) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magntidue of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0.2 mag
f) A star with an absolute V magnitude of 7 and observed magnitude of 7 mag, E(B-V) = 0. mag

A) b < d < e < a < c

B) b < a < f < c

C d < b < f < c

D) b < e < c < f
