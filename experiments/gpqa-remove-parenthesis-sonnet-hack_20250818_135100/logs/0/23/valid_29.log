=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
D %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 21:33:03,042 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) For a compound to be optically active:
• It must have at least one chiral center
• A chiral center requires a carbon with four different substituents
• This means the molecule must not have symmetry

2) We're looking at saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes), so we'll determine molecular formulas from elemental analysis and mass spectrometry

3) Let's calculate molecular formulas for each:
• A) C5H12 (Pentane)
• B) C6H14 (Hexane)
• C) C4H8 (Butene - not a saturated hydrocarbon)
• D) C7H16 (Heptane)

4) Let's look for potential chiral centers
• Pentane: No chiral centers
• Hexane: No chiral centers
• Butene: Not applicable
• Heptane: 2-methylhexane would have a chiral center at the 2nd carbon

5) The mass spectrum for D matches 2-methylhexane's fragmentation pattern

6) Therefore, D is the only dataset corresponding to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon.
