=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) ะก6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
B 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:32:52,862 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The para/ortho substitution depends on the directing effect of the substituent groups.

2) Groups are classified as:
- Activating ortho/para directors: -CH3, -C2H5
- Deactivating meta directors: -NO2, -COOH
- Weakly deactivating para directors: -Cl, -COOC2H5

3) Let's analyze the groups from least to most para-directing:
- -NO2 (strong meta director, lowest para yield)
- -COOH (deactivating meta director)
- -COOC2H5 (weak para director)
- -Cl (weak para director)
- -CH3 (strong ortho/para activator)
- -C2H5 (strong ortho/para activator)

4) Ordering from least to most para-isomer yield:
4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 3 (-Cl) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5)

5) This matches option C.

Answer: C

Reasoning: The para yield depends on the directing effect of the substituent, with strong meta directors giving the lowest para yield and strong activating ortho/para directors giving the highest para yield.
