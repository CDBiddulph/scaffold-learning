=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



D (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 21:33:19,028 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the general velocity addition formula for relativistic motion:
   w = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c²)
   where u is the speed of light in the glass's frame and v is the glass's velocity

2) In this case:
   • u = 1/n (speed of light in glass)
   • c = 1
   • v is the velocity of the glass toward the observer

3) Substituting these into the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   w = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)v)

4) Rearranging this algebraically:
   w = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)

5) Multiplying numerator and denominator by n:
   w = (1 + nv) / (n + v)

6) This matches the answer choice D: (1+n*v)/(n+v)

Key points:
• The formula accounts for relativistic velocity addition
• The beam's speed in the lab frame depends on the glass's motion
• When v = 0, the speed reduces to 1/n as expected
