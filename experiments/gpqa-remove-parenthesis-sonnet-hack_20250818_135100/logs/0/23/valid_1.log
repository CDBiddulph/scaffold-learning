=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
C 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:32:23,573 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Cs-137 decay characteristics:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
• Emits beta and gamma radiation
• Typical gamma ray energy is around 662 keV

2) Calculate number of decays per minute:
• Total number of atoms = 10^17
• Decay constant λ = ln(2)/half-life
• Decay rate = Number of atoms × decay constant
• This comes out to approximately 10^8 decays per minute

3) Consider detector geometry:
• Detector size is 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
• Distance is 4 meters = 400 cm
• Surface area at 4m distance will be much larger
• Solid angle calculation suggests only a small fraction of emitted gamma rays will hit detector

4) Estimate detection probability:
• Typical gamma detection efficiency for such a detector might be around 10%
• Time elapsed = 80 minutes

5) Calculate detected gamma rays:
• Total decays in 80 minutes = 10^8 × 80 = 8 × 10^9
• Detected fraction ≈ 10%
• Detected gamma rays ≈ 10^8

The answer matches option B: 100 million (10^8).
