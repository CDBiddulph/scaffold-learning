2025-08-18 21:32:25,254 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation equilibrium for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The dissociation constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5 × 10¹⁰

3) The initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M

4) Let the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium be x

5) The equilibrium constant expression is:
   Kca-EDTA = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

6) Substituting the values:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

7) Since Kca-EDTA is very large, x will be very small compared to 0.02
   So we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02

8) Rearranging the equation:
   x² = (5 × 10¹⁰)(0.02)
   x = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

9) This is the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions

10) Comparing with the given options, this matches option B.
