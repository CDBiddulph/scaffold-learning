=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

A 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:33:15,369 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the forces involved:
   • The attractive force is likely gravity
   • The repulsive force is likely the electrostatic force (Coulomb's force)

2) The gravitational force between two masses is given by:
   F_g = G(m1 * m2) / r²
   Where G is the gravitational constant

3) The electrostatic force between two charges is given by:
   F_e = k(q1 * q2) / r²
   Where k is Coulomb's constant

4) The key observation here is the distance of 137 meters.

5) If the particles are "smallest attainable charge and mass", this sounds like elementary particles.

6) The specific number 137 hints at the fine structure constant (α), which is approximately 1/137.

7) In fact, the ratio of electrostatic force to gravitational force between two elementary particles is around 1/137².

8) This suggests the ratio of repulsive (electrostatic) to attractive (gravitational) force is 1/137².

9) Looking at the options, this corresponds to option C.
