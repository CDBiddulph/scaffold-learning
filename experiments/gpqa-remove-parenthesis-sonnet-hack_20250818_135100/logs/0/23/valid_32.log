=== INPUT ===
We have a solution (at 25°C) containing Fe(III) and Fe(II) ions. The concentration Fe(III) ion is equal to 0.01 M and the concentration of Fe(II) ion is equal to 0.01 M. The solution also contains sulfuric acid and the solution pH is 1.0. What will be the resulting redox potential of the solution if we add as much orthophosphate acid to it so that total phosphate ions concentration in the solution is 0.1 M? The E0 for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system is 0.77 V and the complex formation constant of the Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex is 10^21. At pH 1.0 and at 0.1 M total total phosphate ions concentration, the equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^- ions is 6.97x10^-3 M.

A -0.34 V
B) +0.52 V
C) +0.26 V
D) +0.40 V

2025-08-18 21:33:07,159 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand the impact of phosphate ions on the redox potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system.

2) The Fe(III)-H2PO4^- complex formation constant is extremely high (10^21), which means most Fe(III) ions will be complexed with phosphate.

3) This complexation will effectively reduce the concentration of free Fe(III) ions in solution.

4) We know:
   • [Fe(III)] initial = 0.01 M
   • [Fe(II)] initial = 0.01 M
   • [H2PO4^-] = 6.97 × 10^-3 M
   • pH = 1.0
   • E0 for Fe(III)/Fe(II) = 0.77 V

5) The Nernst equation for redox potential is:
   E = E0 - (RT/nF) * ln([Fe(II)]/[Fe(III)])

6) With most Fe(III) complexed, the free Fe(III) concentration will be dramatically reduced.

7) The reduction in free Fe(III) will shift the redox potential positively.

8) Calculations suggest the potential will be around +0.52 V.

9) This corresponds to option B.
