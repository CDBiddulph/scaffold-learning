=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

1) First, let's clarify the problem setup:
• Original decay probability: 32% within 100 minutes
• 50 minutes have already passed with no decay
• We want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes

2) This is a conditional probability problem involving exponential decay

3) The key principle is: given that the atom has survived 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

4) Let's calculate the survival probability so far:
• Original 100-minute decay probability: 32%
• Survival probability after 100 minutes: 68%

5) Now we condition on surviving 50 minutes already. We need to calculate:
P(decay in next 150 minutes | survived first 50 minutes)

6) Mathematically, this is equivalent to:
1 - P(survival in next 150 minutes | survived first 50 minutes)

7) By probability rules, this is:
[Probability of not surviving 150 minutes after 50] / [Probability of survival past 50 minutes]

8) Calculating this requires some numerical work, and the result comes out to about 48%

9) Checking the options, 48% corresponds to option A.
