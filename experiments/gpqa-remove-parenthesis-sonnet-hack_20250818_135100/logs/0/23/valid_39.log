=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
D At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 21:33:18,852 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what the scenario describes:
- ChIP-seq was done on PFA-fixed human B cell samples
- An IKAROS transcription factor antibody was used
- Original peaks disappeared when fixation method changed to PFA+DSG

2. Consider what PFA+DSG crosslinking does:
- PFA+DSG is a more stringent/stable crosslinking method
- It creates more extensive protein-protein and protein-DNA crosslinks
- This suggests the disappearing peaks represent more transient or weak interactions

3. Where would such transient/weak interactions most likely occur?
- Active regulatory regions have dynamic protein binding
- Promoters and enhancers are sites of active transcription factor recruitment
- These regions have frequent, sometimes brief transcription factor interactions
- Weak interactions are more likely to be disrupted by more stringent crosslinking

4. Evaluating the options:
- Random locations: Unlikely
- Repeats: Not specifically known for transient interactions
- Introns: Not primary sites of transcription factor binding
- Active promoters/enhancers: Matches our reasoning perfectly

This logic points strongly toward active promoters and enhancers as the most likely location of these disappearing peaks.
