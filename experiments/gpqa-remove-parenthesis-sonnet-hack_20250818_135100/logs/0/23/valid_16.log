=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

D The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 21:32:43,269 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, understand the scenario:
• A CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was performed in a 1-cell fertilized egg
• The embryo developed to full term
• Different tissues have different genomic sequences

2. Analyze potential causes of genomic mosaicism:
• The most likely scenario is imperfect gene editing during early embryonic cell divisions

3. Break down the possible mechanisms:

A) Converting mRNA to cDNA is not a typical mechanism for generating genomic differences
• Not a scientifically plausible explanation

B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation doesn't explain differential integration
• Unlikely mechanism

C) Surrogate mother's DNA incorporation is highly improbable
• No biological mechanism supports this

D) Continuous Cas9 cutting and donor DNA incorporation during embryonic development
• This is the most probable explanation
• During early cell divisions, CRISPR-Cas9 might edit cells at different stages
• Some cells would get edited, others not, leading to genomic mosaicism
• This mechanism explains why different tissue lineages have different genomic sequences

4. Conclusion:
The continuous action of Cas9 during early embryonic development leading to differential gene editing is the most likely cause of the observed genomic differences.
