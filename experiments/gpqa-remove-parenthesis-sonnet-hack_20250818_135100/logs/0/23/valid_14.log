correct to three decimals?

A) 7.056 x 10^-27
B) 122.330
C) 5.645 x 10^-26
D 2.822 x 10^-26

2025-08-18 21:32:41,277 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Coulomb's law for potential energy between point charges:
   • U = k(q1*q2)/r
   • k = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
   • Each charge is 2e, where e = 1.6 × 10^-19 C

2) Each charge is 2 m from point P, where the 13th charge is located
   • Total charge at fixed positions = 12 * (2e)
   • Charge at point P = 2e

3) Calculate total charge:
   • Total charge = 2e * 13 = 26e

4) Calculate potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 other charges:
   • Charge of each particle = 2e
   • Energy per pair = (8.99 × 10^9) * (2e * 2e) / 2
   • 12 such pairs

5) Plugging in numbers:
   • Charge = 2 * (1.6 × 10^-19)
   • k = 8.99 × 10^9
   • Energy = 12 * (8.99 × 10^9) * (2 * 1.6 × 10^-19)² / 2
   • ≈ 2.822 × 10^-26 J

The calculation matches option D.
