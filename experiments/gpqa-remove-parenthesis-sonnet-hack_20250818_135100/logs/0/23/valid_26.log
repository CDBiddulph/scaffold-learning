1) First, let's recall the formula for the angular size θ of an object:
   θ = 2R/d
   Where R is the radius of the object and d is the distance

2) We know:
   θ = 10^-17 degrees
   d = 10^10 parsecs

3) Convert parsecs to meters:
   1 parsec = 3.086 × 10^16 meters
   d = 10^10 × (3.086 × 10^16) = 3.086 × 10^26 meters

4) Rearrange the angular size formula to find the radius:
   R = (θ × d) / 2
   R = (10^-17 × 3.086 × 10^26) / 2
   R ≈ 10^5 meters

5) For a black hole, the entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon:
   S ∝ πR^2

6) Area = π(10^5)^2 = π × 10^10

7) The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula suggests that the entropy is proportional to the area in Planck units.
   Dimensionally, this comes out to about 10^64 J/K

8) The closest order of magnitude is 10^66 J/K
