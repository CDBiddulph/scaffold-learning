1) First, recall that the energy of emitted light is complementary to the energy of absorbed light. This means the absorbed color will be the complementary color to the emitted color.

2) The energy given is 2.3393 eV.

3) Let's convert this to wavelength using the equation E = hc/λ
   • h (Planck's constant) = 4.136 × 10^-15 eV·s
   • c (speed of light) = 3 × 10^8 m/s
   • λ = (hc)/E = (4.136 × 10^-15 × 3 × 10^8) / 2.3393
   • λ ≈ 530 nm

4) 530 nm falls in the green region of the visible spectrum.

5) The complementary color to green is red.

6) Therefore, if the dye emits light at this energy, it must have absorbed red light.

7) Looking at the given options, red corresponds to answer choice C.
