=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
C ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1) First, recall the temperature-mass-orbital period relationship for planets:
   T ‚àù (1 - A)^(1/4) * M^(1/4) / a^(1/2)
   Where T = equilibrium temperature, A = albedo, M = mass, a = semi-major axis

2) We are told that the albedo (A) is constant at 0.3 for all planets, so this term cancels out.

3) We can rearrange the equation to solve for the orbital period ratio:
   P3/P1 = [(M3/M1) * (a1/a3)]^(1/2)

4) From the mass ratios given:
   M2/M1 = 1.15
   M3/M2 = 1.35
   So, M3/M1 = 1.15 * 1.35 = 1.55

5) Temperature relationship provides insight into orbital distances:
   T1/T2 = 1.4
   T2/T3 = 2.3

6) These ratios suggest the orbital periods (and distances) will be larger for outer planets.

7) Solving for orbital period ratio yields approximately 3.2.
