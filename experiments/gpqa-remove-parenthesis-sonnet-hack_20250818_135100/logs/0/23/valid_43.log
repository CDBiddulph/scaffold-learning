=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

A) aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
B aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
C) aaaacccgggATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaggatccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
D) aaaaggatccATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG; aaaaagcttGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:33:25,177 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, look at the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) of the expression vector:
• Contains restriction sites: SmaI, HindIII, BglII, KpnI, PstI, BamHI, EcoRI

2. We want to use two different restriction enzymes for directional cloning.

3. Ideal candidates from the given enzymes are HindIII and KpnI.

4. Designing primers:
• Forward primer needs HindIII site (5' end): aaaaaagctt
• Reverse primer needs KpnI site (3' end): aaaggtacc
• Both primers must introduce the restriction sites while maintaining the correct reading frame

5. Checking the given options:
• Option A uses HindIII at the 5' end and KpnI at the 3' end
• Primer sequences match the requirements
• The primers will allow directional cloning into the MCS

6. Verifying option A:
• Forward primer: aaaaaagcttATGAATCCGCGGCAGGG
   - Contains HindIII site
   - Starts at the start codon (ATG)
• Reverse primer: aaaggtaccGAGACCGCGATTTTCCACAAAGG
   - Contains KpnI site
   - Complements the reverse strand
   - Includes the stop codon
