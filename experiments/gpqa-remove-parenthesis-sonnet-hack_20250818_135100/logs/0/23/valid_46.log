2025-08-18 21:33:31,422 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law, which relates peak wavelength to temperature:
   λ_peak ∝ 1/T

2) Peak energy is inversely proportional to temperature. So:
   T_A/T_sun = (7.21 eV)/(1.41 eV)

3) Calculate the temperature ratio:
   T_A/T_sun = 5.11

4) Luminosity is related to radius and temperature by:
   L ∝ R²T⁴

5) We're told star A is 24 times as luminous as the sun. Let's set up the ratio:
   L_A/L_sun = (R_A/R_sun)² * (T_A/T_sun)⁴

6) Substitute the known values:
   24 = (R_A/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴

7) Solve for (R_A/R_sun):
   24 = (R_A/R_sun)² * 602.44
   (R_A/R_sun)² = 24/602.44
   R_A/R_sun = √(24/602.44)
   R_A/R_sun = 0.63 * 0.27
   R_A/R_sun = 0.17

8) Check the given options, and 0.17 corresponds to D.
