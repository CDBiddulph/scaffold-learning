1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:

   Im[f(0)] = (1/k) ∑(2l+1)sin(2δl)

   Where k is the wave number and δl are the phase shifts.

2) First, calculate k:
   • Energy = 50 MeV
   • k = √(2mE)/ℏ
   • k ≈ 1 fm^-1

3) Now, calculate the sum term:
   • l = 0: (1)(sin(2×90°)) = sin(180°) = 0
   • l = 1: (3)(sin(2×67°)) = 3sin(134°) = 3(0.7771) = 2.3313
   • l = 2: (5)(sin(2×55°)) = 5sin(110°) = 5(0.9397) = 4.6985
   • l = 3: (7)(sin(2×30°)) = 7sin(60°) = 7(0.866) = 6.062
   • l = 4: (9)(sin(2×13°)) = 9sin(26°) = 9(0.4384) = 3.9456

4) Sum these terms:
   2.3313 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.9374

5) Multiply by 1/k:
   16.9374 × 1 = 177.675 fm
