=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

A 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

1. First, understand the key information:
• Satellites in low Earth orbit can detect objects
• Localization precision is about 100-200 arc minutes
• The distribution of objects is isotropic (uniform in all directions)

2. Consider the localization precision:
• 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular area
• This suggests the detected objects are likely at large distances

3. Evaluate each option's distance scale:
• Option A: 1 million or 1 billion light years
   - These are extremely large cosmological distances
   - Consistent with wide-field astronomical surveys
   - Would appear uniformly distributed

• Option B: 1-100 thousand light years
   - Within our galaxy's scale
   - Consistent with detecting many astronomical objects
   - Uniform distribution possible

• Option C: 10-100 light years
   - Very local to our solar system
   - Too small a scale for meaningful surveys

• Option D: 10 light minutes or 100 light seconds
   - Extremely close, within solar system
   - Too small for meaningful astronomical object detection

4. Conclusion:
Option A or B are most consistent with the description. However, A better matches the description of isotropic distribution and wide-field detection.
