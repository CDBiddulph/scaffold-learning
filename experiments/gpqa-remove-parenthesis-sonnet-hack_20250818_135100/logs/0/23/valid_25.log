=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

A 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 21:32:56,283 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's note the key conditions:
   - Inner sphere radius = d1
   - Outer sphere radius = 100 * d1
   - Wave function is time-independent, spherically symmetric, real-valued

2) We're told two key probability constraints:
   - Probability in range [d1, 2*d1] = P
   - Probability in range [2*d1, 3*d1] = P

3) Let the wave function be of the form ψ(r) = f(r)

4) Probability density is proportional to |ψ(r)|^2

5) For the probability to be equal in the two ranges, the volume of the shell must be balanced by the square of the wave function

6) The volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r^2 * dr

7) So, |ψ(r)|^2 must be proportional to 1/r^2 for the probabilities to be equal

8) This means ψ(r) must be proportional to 1/r

9) Therefore, the wave function has the form ψ(r) ∝ 1/r
