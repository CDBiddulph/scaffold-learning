2025-08-18 21:32:38,886 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's understand what SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) represents:
• It's an extension of the Standard Model that parameterizes new physics effects at high energy scales
• It must respect fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory

2. Lorentz Symmetry:
• This is a fundamental symmetry of special relativity
• All quantum field theories, including SMEFT, must respect Lorentz invariance
• Therefore, this must be respected ✓

3. Poincaré Symmetry:
• This includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations
• Also fundamental to quantum field theory
• SMEFT must respect this ✓

4. CP Symmetry:
• CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is not strictly required
• In fact, CP violation is known to exist in some interactions
• Not a mandatory symmetry for SMEFT ✗

5. CPT Symmetry:
• This is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
• Believed to be a universal symmetry in all quantum field theories
• SMEFT must respect this ✓

By this reasoning, Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected.
