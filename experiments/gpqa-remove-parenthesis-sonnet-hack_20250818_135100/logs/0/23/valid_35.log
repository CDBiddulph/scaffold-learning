=== INPUT ===
Hi-C analysis based on 50M cells has revealed a highly significant interaction signal between 5kb bins containing an active promoter and an active enhancer, respectively, separated by a linear distance of ~1 Mb. However, this contact could not be validated by FISH. Targeting dCas9-KRAB to the enhancer reduced the expression from the promoter by ~20%. What is the most likely reason for the inconsistency between Hi-C and FISH results?


A Interaction frequency too low to be reliably detectable by FISH
B) Incorrect expectation of the linear interaction distance due to structural variation
C) Linear interaction too short for FISH detection
D) A false-positive signal in Hi-C

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:33:12,946 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Hi-C Results:
- Significant interaction signal between 5kb bins
- Active promoter and active enhancer
- ~1 Mb linear distance apart
- Functional consequence: dCas9-KRAB at enhancer reduces promoter expression by 20%

2. FISH Results:
- Could not validate the Hi-C interaction

3. Analysis of potential reasons:
A) Interaction frequency too low for FISH: This seems unlikely because the Hi-C signal was "highly significant"

B) Structural variation affecting interaction distance:
- Possible explanation
- Structural variations could create 3D genomic configurations that bring distant regions closer
- The actual spatial proximity might differ from linear genomic distance

C) Linear interaction too short for FISH: Unlikely, as 1 Mb is typically detectable by FISH

D) False-positive Hi-C signal: Less probable, given the functional validation by dCas9-KRAB experiment showing gene expression effect

4. Key Evidence:
- dCas9-KRAB experiment suggests a real functional interaction
- Most likely explanation is a 3D genomic configuration not captured by linear distance measurement

Reasoning strongly points to structural variation affecting the interaction's spatial configuration.
