=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
D 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:32:40,505 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams represent mathematical expressions describing particle interactions.

2) The number of loops in a Feynman diagram corresponds to the power of the loop integration over internal momenta.

3) A key hint about the number of loops can often be found in the power of certain terms in the calculation.

4) In this case, we see the term (1/(4π)^6 in the expression.

5) The power of 6 in the denominator suggests multiple loop integrations.

6) Specifically, the power of 6 in 1/(4π)^6 implies 3 loop integrations.

7) Each loop typically contributes a factor of 1/(4π)^2 to the denominator.

8) So 3 loops would indeed result in a (1/(4π)^6 term.

9) Checking the diagram's loops is consistent with this: the spilled coffee obscures the details, but the mathematical expression points to 3 loops.

Therefore, the most likely number of loops is 3.
