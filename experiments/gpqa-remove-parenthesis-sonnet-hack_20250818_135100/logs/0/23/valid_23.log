=== INPUT ===
Which of the following stars or stellar systems will appear the brightest in V magnitude when observed from Earth? Assume there is no extinction.

a) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 50 parsecs.
b) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.
c) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
d) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.
e) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
f) A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.

A) A star with an apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at a distance of 20 parsecs.

B A two-star system with individual absolute magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 7 mag, both at distances of 10 parsecs.
C) A two-star system with individual apparent magnitudes of Vmag_1 = 7 and Vmag_2 = 8 mag, both at distances of 5 parsecs.
D) A star with an absolute magnitude of Vmag = 7 mag at a distance of 10 parsecs.

2025-08-18 21:32:54,655 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Recall the distance modulus formula: m - M = 5 log(d/10), where:
   m = apparent magnitude
   M = absolute magnitude
   d = distance in parsecs

2) A) A star with apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at 50 parsecs:
   - Already an apparent magnitude of 7 mag
   - No need for further calculation

3) B) A star with apparent V magnitude of 7 mag at 20 parsecs:
   - Already an apparent magnitude of 7 mag
   - Closer than option A, so likely brighter

4) C) Two-star system with Vmag_1 = 7, Vmag_2 = 8 at 5 parsecs:
   - Total apparent brightness requires adding flux, not just magnitudes
   - Magnitude difference is 1, so they will appear brighter together

5) D) A star with absolute magnitude 7 mag at 10 parsecs:
   - At 10 parsecs, absolute and apparent magnitude are the same
   - Apparent magnitude would be 7 mag

6) Comparing these, the system at 5 parsecs with two stars will appear brightest due to its proximity.
