=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-18 21:33:34,258 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with UV light
• This suggests a photochemical reaction
• Since the molecular weight remains the same, this indicates a rearrangement or photoisomerization

2) The most likely photochemical transformation is a Norrish Type II reaction
• This involves hydrogen abstraction and carbon-carbon bond cleavage
• This would form a ketyl radical species that can rearrange

3) The product of this UV irradiation (product 1) is likely a bicyclic ketone isomer

4) When this product is hydrogenated with Pd/C and H2
• This will add hydrogen across a double bond or reduce a ketone
• Given the structure is bicyclic, this suggests reducing a ketone to an alcohol

5) The most deshielded hydrogen in this final product (product 2) would be the alcohol proton
• Alcohol protons typically have variable coupling patterns
• If this proton is near other hydrogens, it would likely show a doublet of doublets splitting pattern

6) Reasoning points to a doublet of doublets for the alcohol proton
