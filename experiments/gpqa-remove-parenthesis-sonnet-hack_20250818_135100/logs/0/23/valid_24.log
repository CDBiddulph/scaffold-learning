=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

A chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 21:32:56,596 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the time dilation effect for each particle based on their speed:
   - Zeta: speed = 0.96c, time dilation factor = √(1 - 0.96²) = 0.28
   - Eta: speed = 0.9c, time dilation factor = √(1 - 0.9²) = 0.44
   - Chi: speed = 0.88c, time dilation factor = √(1 - 0.88²) = 0.47
   - Lambda: speed = 0.93c, time dilation factor = √(1 - 0.93²) = 0.37

2) Distance to travel = 13000m

3) Time to reach ground in their reference frame:
   - Zeta: 13000m / (0.96c) = 0.000045s * 0.28 = 1.26e-5s
   - Eta: 13000m / (0.9c) = 0.000048s * 0.44 = 2.11e-5s
   - Chi: 13000m / (0.88c) = 0.000049s * 0.47 = 2.30e-5s
   - Lambda: 13000m / (0.93c) = 0.000047s * 0.37 = 1.74e-5s

4) Ordering by how many will reach ground in 1e-5s, from most to least:
   Chi < Eta < Lambda < Zeta

Therefore, the order is:
zeta > lambda > eta > chi
