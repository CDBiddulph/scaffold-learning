1) First, let's understand what happens when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI:
   • Red phosphorus and HI will reduce the molecule
   • The reduction will remove oxygen from the carboxylic acid and aldehyde groups
   • It will also saturate the vinyl group and the double bond in the ring

2) Let's count the hydrogens and carbons in the original molecule:
   • Original molecule has:
     - 1 aldehyde group (CHO)
     - 1 carboxylic acid group (COOH)
     - 1 vinyl group (CH=CH2)
     - 1 double bond in the ring

3) After reduction, the molecule will have:
   • All double bonds converted to single bonds
   • Oxygen groups converted to corresponding CH2 groups
   • Fully saturated ring and side groups

4) The index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of rings plus the number of double bonds in the molecule

5) After reduction, the resulting molecule will have:
   • No double bonds
   • 1 ring
   • No other unsaturations

6) Therefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency = 1

The answer corresponds to option D.
