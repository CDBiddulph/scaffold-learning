2025-08-18 21:32:24,145 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand density:
• Density = Mass / Volume
• Volume is related to radius cubed
• Composition affects density

2) Option a (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet):
• This would have the same density as Earth
• Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³
• Radius and mass proportionally balanced

3) Option b (2 Earth masses, 5.5 g/cm³):
• Given density, but not clear how mass is distributed
• May not be same compositional balance as Earth

4) Option c (5x Earth's mass, same composition):
• If composition is same, this means larger planet
• More mass compressed into proportionally larger volume
• Density will remain approximately 5.5 g/cm³

5) Option d (½ Earth's mass, same composition):
• Smaller mass, smaller volume
• Density would remain approximately 5.5 g/cm³

6) Comparing the options:
• All options essentially have very similar densities (≈5.5 g/cm³)
• But option c explicitly maintains Earth's composition while being larger

7) By given information, option c would have most stable density
