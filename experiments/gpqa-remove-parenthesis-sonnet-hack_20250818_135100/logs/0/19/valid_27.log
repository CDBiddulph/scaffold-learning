=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


D -12*hbar/25

1) First, recall the general formula for expectation value:
   • <S_y> = (state vector)† σ_y (state vector)

2) The state vector is (3i, 4)

3) σ_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 ...
