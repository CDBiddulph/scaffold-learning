=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
C triplet
D) doublet
