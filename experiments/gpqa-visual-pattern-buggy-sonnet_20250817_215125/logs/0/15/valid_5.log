=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

■ B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

2025-08-18 05:07:01,020 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The formula for the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is:
   Im(f(0)) = (1/2ik) Σ(2l+1)sin(2δl)

2) k is the wave number, which can be calculated from the electron energy:
   • Energy = 50 MeV
   • k = √(2mE) = √(2 * (0.511 MeV) * 50 MeV)
   • k ≈ ...
