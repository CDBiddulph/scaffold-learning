=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
■ B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:06:58,001 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the probability of decay:
   • The atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes
   • 50 minutes have already passed without decay

2) This is a problem involving conditional probability and survival probability

3) Let's calculate the surv...
