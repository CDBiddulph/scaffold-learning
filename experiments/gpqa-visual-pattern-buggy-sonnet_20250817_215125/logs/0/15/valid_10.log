=== INPUT ===
9-fluorenone and 2 equivalents of selectfluor were combined in an acetonitrile solution and irradiated with 400nm light.

a product formed, which was observed via 19F NMR to have two fluorine signals at +29.8 ppm and -115.7 ppm. What is the name of this product?

A) 2,6-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
■ B) 2'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride
C) 1,5-difluoro-9H-fluoren-9-one
D) 4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl fluoride

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:07:05,682 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material:
• 9-fluorenone
• 2 equivalents of selectfluor
• Irradiated with 400nm light

2. Selectfluor is a fluorinating reagent that can introduce fluorine into aromatic systems under light irradiation.

3. The 19F NMR shows two fluorine signals:
• +29.8 p...
