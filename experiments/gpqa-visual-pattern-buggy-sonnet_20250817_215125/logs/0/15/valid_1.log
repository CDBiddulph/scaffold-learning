=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:06:59,449 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand Caesium-137's decay properties:
• Half-life of Cs-137 is about 30 years
• Each decay emits a gamma ray

2) Calculate the decay rate:
• Number of atoms = 10^17
• Half-life doesn't significantly affect the decay rate in 80 minutes
• Decay rate...
