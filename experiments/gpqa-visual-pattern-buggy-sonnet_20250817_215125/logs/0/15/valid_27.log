=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


■ D) -12*hbar/25

2025-08-18 05:07:22,347 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall that the expectation value of spin along y is calculated by:
   <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ

2) The given state is ψ = (3i, 4)

3) σ_y = [0 -i; i 0]

4) First, let's calculate ψ†:
   ψ† = (3i*, 4*) = (-3i, 4)

5) Now, let's calculate σ_y ψ:
   [0 -i; i 0] × [3i;...
