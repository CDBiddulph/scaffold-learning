=== INPUT ===
In a gas-tight vessel, a mixture of gases A, B and C was exploded in a volume ratio of (A+B): C = 1:2.25. The only products of this reaction were water and HHal acid (Hal = halogen). The densities of gases A and B, measured under the same conditions, differ by a factor of 2.11. The volume ratio between gases A and B is 1:1.
Indicate the mass fraction (%) of HHal acid in the resulting products.

■ A) 33.3
B) 36.6
C) 35.0
D) 37.0

2025-08-18 05:07:39,256 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the initial volume ratios:
• A:B = 1:1
• (A+B):C = 1:2.25

2) From the density information, if A and B are in equal volumes, but their densities differ by 2.11, this suggests different molecular weights.

3) Let's represent the volumes:
• A ...
