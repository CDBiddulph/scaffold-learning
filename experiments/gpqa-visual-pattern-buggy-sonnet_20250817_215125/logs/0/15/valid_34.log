=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
■ D) 315

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:07:31,538 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's look at the given examples:
   AGG -> 115
   TGCTGA -> 176

2) I'll look for a pattern by converting the input sequences to numbers:
   • AGG: 
     A=1, G=3
     Seems like a calculation involves these letter values

   • TGCTGA:
     T=4, G=3, C=2, T...
