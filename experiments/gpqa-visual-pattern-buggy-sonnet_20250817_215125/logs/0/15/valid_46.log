=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.

2025-08-18 05:07:37,955 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall Wien's displacement law: λmax = b/T
   Where b is Wien's displacement constant, and T is temperature

2) Peak energy relates to temperature:
   Star A peak: 7.21 eV
   Sun's peak: 1.41 eV

3) Temperatures are proportional to peak energy:
   T_A/T_sun ...
