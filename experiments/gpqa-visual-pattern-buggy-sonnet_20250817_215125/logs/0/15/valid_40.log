=== INPUT ===
A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)


B) 1
C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)



■ D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)

2025-08-18 05:07:29,953 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the scenario:
   • The light beam is traveling through a glass with refractive index n
   • The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam
   • We want to find the speed of light relative to the observer
   • Speed of li...
