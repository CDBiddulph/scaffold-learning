2025-08-18 05:07:35,604 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between light energy and color:
• Higher energy light appears more toward the blue/violet end of the spectrum
• Lower energy light appears more toward the red/orange end of the spectrum

2) The energy given is 2.3393 eV, which is in t...
