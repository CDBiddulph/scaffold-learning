=== INPUT ===
A chemist performed a reaction on 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol with acid to produce an elimination product. The IR spectrum of the resulting product shows an intense absorption band at 1690 CM^-1. Can you determine the identity of the product?

A) 2-methyl-1,2-diphenylpropan-1-one
B) 2,3-diphenylbut-3-en-2-ol
■ C) 3,3-diphenylbutan-2-one
D) 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:07:21,770 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Starting material: 2,3-diphenylbutane-2,3-diol
• This is a diol with two phenyl groups

2. Reaction conditions: Acid-catalyzed elimination
• Acid will promote dehydration
• This typically removes water and forms a new double bond

3. Let's consider the possible eli...
