=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
■ C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-18 05:07:38,179 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Starting material: bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one
• This is a ketone in a rigid bicyclic system

2) UV irradiation → Product 1
• This suggests a photochemical reaction
• Most likely, this is a photochemical decarbonylation, where CO is eliminated
• The molecular weight ...
