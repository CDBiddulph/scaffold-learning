2025-08-18 05:06:58,026 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's look at trans-cinnamaldehyde:
   • It's C9H8O (a 3-phenylpropenal)
   • Has a benzene ring with a 3-carbon side chain ending in an aldehyde

2) Treatment with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent):
   • This will add a methyl group to the aldehyde...
