=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

■ A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:07:21,623 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, we need to calculate the distance traveled by each particle in 1e-5s
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Time is constant at 1e-5s

2) Calculate distance for each particle:
- Zeta (0.96c): 0.96 × (3 × 10^8) × (1 × 10^-5) = 28,800m
- Eta (0.9c): 0.9 × (3 × 10^8) × (1...
