=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
■ C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

2025-08-18 05:07:22,104 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, the angular size θ relates to the physical size R of the event horizon by the angular distance formula:
   R = d × θ (in radians)

2) Convert the angular size from degrees to radians:
   10^-17 degrees = 10^-17 × (π/180) radians

3) Calculate the radius:
   ...
