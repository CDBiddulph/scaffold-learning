=== INPUT ===
Which of the following data sets corresponds to an optically active saturated hydrocarbon?

A) %age Composition = C 83.33 % and H 16.66 %
EI-MS: m/z = 72, 57, 43, 29
B) %age Composition = C 83.72 % and H 16.27 %
EI-MS: m/z = 86, 57, 43, 29
C) %age Composition = C 82.75 % and H 17.25 %
EI-MS: m/z = 58, 43, 27, 15
■ D) %age Composition = C 84 % and H 16 %
EI-MS: m/z = 100, 71, 57, 43

2025-08-18 05:07:22,696 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) To be optically active, a molecule must:
• Have a chiral carbon center (asymmetric carbon)
• This means the carbon has 4 different substituents

2) For a saturated hydrocarbon, this means the molecule must have a chiral carbon with 4 different groups attached.

3) ...
