=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
■ B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

2025-08-18 05:06:59,066 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's write the dissociation reaction for the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given as:
   Kf = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) We know:
   • Kf = 5 × 10¹⁰
   • Initial concentration of Ca-EDTA = 0...
