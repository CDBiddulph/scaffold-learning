2025-08-18 05:07:06,162 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory) is:
• It's an effective field theory that describes interactions beyond the Standard Model
• It must respect fundamental symmetries of the underlying physics

2) Lorentz Symmetry:
• This is ...
