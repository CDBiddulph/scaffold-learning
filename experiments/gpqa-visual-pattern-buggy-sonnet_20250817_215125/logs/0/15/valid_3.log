2025-08-18 05:06:59,129 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the relationship between mass, volume, and density:
   • Density = Mass / Volume
   • For spherical objects like planets, volume increases with the cube of radius

2) Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet
   • This would have exactly the sam...
