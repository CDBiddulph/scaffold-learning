=== INPUT ===
Suppose you have two point particles, each of the smallest attainable charge and mass (speaking roughly on the latter). They are separated at a distance of 137 meters, and experience one attractive force and one repulsive force. What is the ratio of the repulsive force strength to the attractive force strength?

■ A) 1/137
B) 137^2
C) 1/137^2
D) 137

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:07:30,364 [INFO] LLM response preview: Let's solve this step by step:

1) Let's think about the forces involved:
• Attractive force would be gravity
• Repulsive force would be electrostatic repulsion

2) The gravitational force is given by: F_g = G(m1*m2)/r²
• G is gravitational constant
• m1, m2 are masses
• r is distance between partic...
