=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:10:04,362 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the decay characteristics of Caesium-137:
• Half-life is about 30 years
• Each decay produces a gamma-ray

2) Calculate decay rate in 80 minutes:...
