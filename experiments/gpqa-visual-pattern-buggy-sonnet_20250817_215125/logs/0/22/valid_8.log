2025-08-18 05:09:56,059 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the given information:
   - Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex concentration = 0.02 M
   - Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = 5 × 10^10
   - pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C

2) The equilibrium reaction is:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

3) The stability constant (K) is defined as:
   K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

4) Rearranging the equation:
   [Ca²⁺] = K × [Ca-EDTA] / [EDTA⁴⁻]

5) Assuming a 1:1 complex and complete dissociation:
   [Ca²⁺] = (...
