=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:09:56,417 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's calculate the decay constant and half-life of Caesium-137:
   - Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
   - Decay constant λ = ln(2) / Half-life
   - λ ≈ 0.693 / (30 * 365 * 24 * 60) min⁻¹
   - λ ≈ 1.32 × 10⁻⁹ min⁻¹

2) Calculate the number of decays in 80 minutes:
   - Total atoms = 10¹⁷
   - Number of decays = Total atoms * (1 - e^(-λt))
   - Number of decays ≈ 10¹⁷ * (1 - e^(-1.32 × 10⁻⁹ * 80))
   - This is approximately 10¹⁷ * (1 - 0.999...
