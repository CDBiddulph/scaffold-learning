=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

2025-08-18 05:09:56,336 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) In elastic scattering theory, the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction (forward direction) is related to the phase shifts.

2) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by:
   $Im(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin\delta_l)$

3) Here, k is the wave number of the incoming electron.
   $k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$
   (With 50 MeV electron energy)

4) We're given phase shifts for l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

5) Let's calc...
