=== INPUT ===
Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
â–  B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

2025-08-18 05:09:54,948 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

Reaction A (1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ + Heat):
- This is a Claisen rearrangement
- The allylic alcohol will rearrange
- The product will be 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine

Reaction B ((3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat):
- This is a Cope rearrangement
- The terminal alkynes will rearrange
- The product will be (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane

Reaction C (2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat):
- This is another sigmatropic re...
