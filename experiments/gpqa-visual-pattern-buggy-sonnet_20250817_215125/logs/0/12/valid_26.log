=== INPUT ===
The angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is measured to be θ=10^-17 degrees. Find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the blackhole.

A) 10^59 J/K
B) 10^66 J/K
■ C) 10^62 J/K
D) 10^65 J/K

8) Calculating R:
   R ≈ 10^-7 parsecs ≈ 10^14 m

9) Plugging into entropy formula gives an entropy of order 10^66 J/K

10) This matches option B.
