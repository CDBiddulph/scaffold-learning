=== INPUT ===
trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate, forming product 2.

3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-l6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3.

how many carbon atoms are there in product 3?

A) 10
B) 14
C) 12
■ D) 11

2025-08-18 05:05:18,742 [INFO] LLM response (attempt 1):  DMSO:
   • This looks like a Wittig-type reaction
   • This would likely add a 2-carbon unit
   • Total carbons would now be: 10 + 2 = 12 carbons

Therefore, product 3 has 12 carbon atoms.
