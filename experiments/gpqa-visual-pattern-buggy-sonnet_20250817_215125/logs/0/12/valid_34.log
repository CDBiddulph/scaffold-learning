=== INPUT ===
You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

A) 351
B) 333
C) 185
â–  D) 315

8) By trial and error or systematic solving, we find 351 fits the pattern.

9) We can verify 351 as being roughly in line with the previous outputs.

Therefore, the answer is 351.
