=== INPUT ===
An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.
Note: \sigma_y (in latex format) is: 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix}

A) 12*hbar/25
B) 25*hbar/2

C) -25*hbar/2


■ D) -12*hbar/25



Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

7) Then [−3i, 4] • \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ 3i \end{pmatrix}:
   (−3i)(-4i) + (4)(3i) = 12 + 12i = 12(1 + i)

8) Evaluating this gives 12*hbar/25

Therefore, the answer is A.
