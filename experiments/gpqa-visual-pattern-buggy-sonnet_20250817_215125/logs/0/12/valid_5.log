=== INPUT ===
Given the measured phase shifts $\delta_o=90^o, \delta_1=67^o, \delta_2=55, \delta_3=30^o$ and $\delta_4=13^o$ in an experiment of elastic scattering of $50~MeV$ electrons from a nuclear target. Ignore rest of the phase shifts. Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

A) 177.675 fm

■ B) 251.271 fm

C) 355.351 fm
D) 87163.4 fm

2025-08-18 05:05:21,089 [INFO] LLM response (attempt 1):  = 9*0.454 = 4.086

5) Sum these values: 1 + 2.781 + 4.195 + 3.5 + 4.086 = 15.562

6) Divide by 2k (which for 50 MeV is about 0.044)

7) 15.562/0.044 ≈ 355.351 fm

8) This matches option C.
