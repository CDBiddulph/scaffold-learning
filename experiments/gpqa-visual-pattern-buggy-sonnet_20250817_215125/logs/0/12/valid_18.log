=== INPUT ===
The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.
■ B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
