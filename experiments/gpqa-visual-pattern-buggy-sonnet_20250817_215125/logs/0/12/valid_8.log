=== INPUT ===
What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

A) 1.0x10^-2 M 
■ B) 6.3x10^-7 M
C) 5.0x10^-3 M
D) 2.0x10^-2 M

7) Substituting into the stability constant equation:
   x² = (5x10^10)(0.02 - x)

8) Solving this gives [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3x10^-7 M

9) Checking the options, this corresponds to option B.
