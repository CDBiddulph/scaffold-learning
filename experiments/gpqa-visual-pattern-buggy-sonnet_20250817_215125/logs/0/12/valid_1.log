=== INPUT ===
Activity of a material containing pure Caesium-137 (10^17 atoms in total) is being measured. A perfect detector for gamma-rays has a rectangular shape of 2x3 centimeters, and is placed 4 meters away from the material, facing it directly.

After 80 minutes, approximately how many gamma-rays were detected?

A) 10 thousand (10^4).
B) 100 million (10^8).
■ C) 1 million (10^6).
D) 100 (10^2).

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 05:05:19,697 [INFO] LLM response (attempt 1): rays
• Total decays ≈ 10^17
• Fraction hitting detector ≈ 10^-4
• Detected gamma rays ≈ 10^17 × 10^-4 = 10^13 × 10^-9 ≈ 10^4 = 10,000

5) Checking the options, this corresponds to option A.
