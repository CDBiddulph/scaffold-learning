=== INPUT ===
The spectrum of star A, plotted as a function of energy, peaks at a photon energy of 7.21 eV, while it is approximately 24 times as luminous as the sun. How does the radius of star A compare to the sun’s radius?
Note that the spectrum of the sun peaks at 1.41 eV.



A) 0.16


■ B) 0.19


C) 0.21
D) 0.17

2025-08-18 05:05:50,331 [INFO] LLM response (attempt 1): _sun)² * (5.11)⁴

8) Solving for R_A/R_sun:
   (R_A/R_sun)² = 24 / (5.11)⁴
   R_A/R_sun = √(24 / (5.11)⁴)
   R_A/R_sun = 0.17

9) Looking at the given options, 0.17 corresponds to answer D.
