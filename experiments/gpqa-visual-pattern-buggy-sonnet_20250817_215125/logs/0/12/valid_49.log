=== INPUT ===
bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one is irradiated with ultraviolet radiation, forming product 1. The molecular weight of 1 is the same as that of the starting material. 1 was then stirred with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 2. what is the splitting pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen nucleus in the 1H nmr spectrum of 2?

A) doublet of doublets
B) singlet
â–  C) triplet
D) doublet

2025-08-18 05:05:51,712 [INFO] LLM response (attempt 1): ttern for this hydrogen would be a doublet of doublets, reflecting coupling with two different neighboring hydrogens.

Therefore, the most likely splitting pattern is a doublet of doublets.
