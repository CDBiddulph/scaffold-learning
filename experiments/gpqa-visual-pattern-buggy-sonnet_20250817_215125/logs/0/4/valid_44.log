=== INPUT ===
Name reactions in chemistry refer to a specific set of well-known chemical reactions that are typically named after their discoverers or the scientists who made significant contributions to their development. These reactions have had a profound impact on the field of chemistry and are often used as fundamental building blocks in various chemical syntheses.
Identify the reactants for the following name reactions.
A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one
B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol

A) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
B) A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene
C) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one
â–  D) A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol, B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".
