=== INPUT ===
You would like to use PCR to amplify the following sequence (written from 5’ to 3’ direction) for subcloning into an expression vector. In order to clone it in the correct orientation for subsequent expression, you decide to clone it using two different restriction enzymes.

You have the enzymes ApaI, BamHI, BstNI, HindIII, KpnI, and ScaI in your freezer.
The order of features on your expression vector looks like this (the cleavage sites in MCS are shown within brackets):

--CMV promoter---[SmaI--HindIII--BglII--KpnI---PstI--BamHI--EcoRI]-------

Using the information you have been given, choose a suitable pair of primers for PCR (shown in the 5’ to 3’ direction). Ensure your primers will make it possible to clone the sequence given above into the expression vector in a directional manner.

2025-08-18 04:58:27,650 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field: Molecular Biology/Genetics (PCR, cloning, restriction enzyme analysis)

2. Key Considerations:
- Need to clone into the multiple cloning site (MCS)
- Ensure directional cloning
- Match vector's restriction sites
- Include start codon (ATG)

3. Vector MCS Analysis:
- Contains HindIII, KpnI, BamHI
- Need to choose primers with these restriction sites

4. Primer Design Strategy:
- Forward primer needs HindIII or KpnI site
- Reverse primer needs matching complementary site
- Preserve reading frame
- Include start codon

5. Detailed Primer Evaluation:
A) Forward: HindIII site ✓
   Reverse: KpnI site ✓
   Matches vector sites ✓
   Preserves reading frame ✓

B) Forward: HindIII site ✓
   Reverse: BamHI site ✓
   Does NOT match vector's KpnI site ✗

C) Forward: SmaI site ✗
   Reverse: BamHI site ✓
   Does not match vector sites ✗

D) Forward: BamHI site ✗
   Reverse: HindIII site ✓
   Does not match vector sites ✗

6. Conclusion:
Option A perfectly matches the vector's restriction sites and allows directional cloning.
