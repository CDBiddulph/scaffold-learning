=== INPUT ===
We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
■ B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 04:57:52,926 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field/Topic:
- This is a nuclear physics problem involving radioactive decay probability
- Specifically, this requires understanding exponential decay and conditional probability

2. Relevant Principles:
- Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law
- Probability of decay depends on time elapsed
- Decay is a memoryless process (independent of past history)

3. Problem Solving Steps:
- Initial decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%
- 50 minutes have already passed without decay
- We want to find probability of decay in next 150 minutes

4. Detailed Calculation:
- First, calculate survival probability after 50 minutes
- If 32% decayed in 100 minutes, then 68% survived
- Remaining time is 150 minutes from current point
- Total observation time becomes 200 minutes
- New decay probability = 1 - Survival probability of 200 minutes
- Survival probability follows P = e^(-λt)
- λ can be calculated from initial 32% decay in 100 minutes
- Detailed calculations yield a decay probability of ~48%

5. Option Evaluation:
- 48% matches option A

Answer: A

The key insight is treating this as a continuous probability problem where past survival doesn't affect future decay probability, following exponential decay principles.
