2025-08-18 04:58:10,265 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is an astrophysics/black hole physics problem
- Involves understanding black hole event horizon, entropy, and angular size

2. Relevant Principles:
- Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula: S = kA/4L²
- Where k is Boltzmann constant
- A is the area of the event horizon
- L is Planck length

3. Solving the Problem:
a) Angular size θ = 10^-17 degrees
b) Distance d = 10^10 parsecs

4. Calculation Steps:
- Event horizon radius R can be calculated from angular size
- R = d * tan(θ)
- R ≈ d * θ (for small angles)
- R = 10^10 * 10^-17 parsecs
- R = 10^-7 parsecs
- Convert to meters: R ≈ 3 * 10^15 meters

5. Entropy Calculation:
- A = 4πR²
- A ≈ 4π * (3 * 10^15)²
- A ≈ 10^32 m²
- S = kA/4L²
- S ≈ 10^66 J/K

6. Option Evaluation:
- Option B matches our calculation
