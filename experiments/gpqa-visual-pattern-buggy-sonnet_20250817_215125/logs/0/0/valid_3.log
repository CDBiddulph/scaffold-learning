2025-08-18 04:57:51,906 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field: Astronomy and Planetary Science (specifically exoplanet characteristics)

2. Relevant Principles:
- Density = Mass / Volume
- Density is determined by both mass and radius
- For planets with similar composition, density changes with mass and radius

3. Problem Analysis:
- First, recall Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³
- Density depends on both mass and volume (radius)
- Gravitational compression increases with planet mass

4. Detailed Option Evaluation:
a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet = Standard Earth density (5.5 g/cm³)
b) 2 Earth masses with 5.5 g/cm³ density = Slightly different compression
c) Same composition, 5x more massive = Higher gravitational compression
   - More mass will compress the planet, increasing average density
d) Same composition, half mass = Less gravitational compression

5. Reasoning:
- As mass increases, gravitational compression increases
- This causes atoms to pack more tightly
- Result: Higher density than original composition

6. Conclusion: Option c will have the highest density due to increased gravitational compression while maintaining Earth's composition.
