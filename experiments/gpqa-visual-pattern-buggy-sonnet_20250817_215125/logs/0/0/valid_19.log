=== INPUT ===
Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

A) ~ 3.2
B) ~ 4.4
■ C) ~ 33.4
D) ~ 10.4

2025-08-18 04:58:04,846 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is an astronomy problem involving exoplanet characterization
- Uses transit timing variation (TTV) method
- Involves relationships between orbital parameters, temperature, and mass

2. Relevant Principles:
- For circular orbits, orbital period (P) relates to semi-major axis (a) via Kepler's Third Law
- Equilibrium temperature (T) depends on:
   * Stellar luminosity
   * Distance from star
   * Planetary albedo (reflectivity)

3. Problem Analysis:
Let's analyze the given ratios:
- T(Planet1)/T(Planet2) ≈ 1.4
- T(Planet2)/T(Planet3) ≈ 2.3
- M(Planet1)/M(Planet2) ≈ 1.15
- M(Planet2)/M(Planet3) ≈ 1.35

4. Key Relationship Derivation:
- Temperature is proportional to (1/distance)^0.5
- Mass affects orbital dynamics
- We want to find P(Planet3)/P(Planet1)

5. Calculation Steps:
- Using temperature ratios suggests distance relationships
- Temperature ratio suggests orbital period ratio
- Combining mass and temperature ratios indicates orbital period scaling

6. Detailed Reasoning:
P ∝ a^(3/2)
Substituting and cross-referencing given ratios suggests a factor around 10

7. Option Evaluation:
Analyzing the options, 10.4 most closely matches our reasoning

Answer: D

Reasoning breakdown:
- Temperature and mass ratios indicate planetary system dynamics
- The 10.4 factor represents the approximate orbital period difference
- Equal albedo (0.3) ensures consistent temperature calculation method
- Matches observational constraints from TTV method

Answer: D
