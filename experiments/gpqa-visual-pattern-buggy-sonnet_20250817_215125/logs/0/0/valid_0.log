Sigmatropic rearrangement is a class of pericyclic reactions. In these reactions, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are also sigma tropic rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored. Complete the following reactions.
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A
(3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B
2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C

A) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexanal
■ B) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal
C) A = 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine, B = (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol
D) A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexan-1-ol

Academic Field: Organic Chemistry, specifically Pericyclic Reactions and Sigmatropic Rearrangements

Key Principles:
- Sigmatropic rearrangements involve migration of π and σ bonds
- Cope and Claisen rearrangements are specific types of sigmatropic rearrangements
- These reactions typically occur under thermal conditions

Reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat)
- This looks like a Claisen-type rearrangement
- The terminal π bond migrates, forming a new ring structure
- Product will be: 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine

Reaction B: (3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat
- This appears to be a Cope rearrangement
- The terminal alkynes will rearrange to form a cyclobutene
- Product will be: (1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane

Reaction C: 2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat
- Another sigmatropic rearrangement
- Will result in an aldehyde
- Product will be: 4-methylenehexanal

Comparing with the options, this matches Option A.
