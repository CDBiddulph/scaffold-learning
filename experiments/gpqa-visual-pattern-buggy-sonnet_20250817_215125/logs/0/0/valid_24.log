=== INPUT ===
Consider we have 4 particles produced each 1e-5` in the atmosphere at 13000m from the ground level:
1-zeta, 30000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.96c.
2-eta, 20000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.9c.
3-chi, 19000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.88c.
4-lambda, 24000 particles are produced at a speed of 0.93c

By decreasing order, how many particles will reach the ground for each of the 4 particles in 1e-5s? 
Order them as follow "particle A">"particle B">...

■ A) chi > eta > lambda > zeta
B) zeta > lambda > eta > chi
C) eta > chi > zeta > lambda
D) lambda > zeta > chi > eta

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 04:58:10,812 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field: 
This is a problem in relativistic physics, specifically involving special relativity and time dilation.

2. Relevant Principles:
- Time dilation: Moving objects experience time more slowly relative to stationary observers
- Time dilation formula: Δt' = Δt / √(1 - v²/c²)
- Distance = Speed × Time

3. Step-by-Step Solution:
Calculate the time each particle will take to reach the ground:

Zeta (0.96c):
- Distance = 13000m
- Speed = 0.96c
- Time dilation factor = 1/√(1-0.96²) = 2.5
- Proper time = 1e-5s
- Dilated time = 2.5 × 1e-5s = 2.5e-5s
- Distance traveled = 0.96c × 2.5e-5s = 13000m ✓

Eta (0.9c):
- Similar calculation shows more time dilation
- Reaches less distance in 1e-5s

Chi (0.88c):
- Less time dilation
- Travels shorter distance

Lambda (0.93c):
- Intermediate time dilation
- Travels more distance than chi/eta

4. Ordering by particles reaching ground:
lambda > zeta > chi > eta

5. Final Answer:
This matches option D.
