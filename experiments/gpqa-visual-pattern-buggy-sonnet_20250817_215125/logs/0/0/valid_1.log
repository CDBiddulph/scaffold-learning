2025-08-18 04:57:53,219 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field:
This is a nuclear physics problem involving radioactive decay and radiation detection.

2. Relevant Principles:
- Caesium-137 is a radioactive isotope
- Radioactive decay follows exponential decay law
- Half-life of Cs-137 is approximately 30 years
- Decay rate depends on number of atoms and half-life
- Gamma-ray detection depends on detector area and distance

3. Problem Solving Steps:
a) Calculate decay constant (λ):
- Half-life of Cs-137 ≈ 30 years = 1.58 × 10^9 minutes
- λ = ln(2) / half-life = 0.693 / (1.58 × 10^9) ≈ 4.4 × 10^-10 per minute

b) Calculate decay rate:
- Total atoms = 10^17
- Decay rate = λ × number of atoms
- Decay rate ≈ 4.4 × 10^-10 × 10^17 = 4.4 × 10^7 decays per minute

c) Calculate detected gamma-rays:
- Detector area: 2 × 3 = 6 cm²
- Solid angle at 4m distance will be small
- Estimated detected fraction: ~10^-4
- Detected gamma-rays: 4.4 × 10^7 × 80 minutes × 10^-4 ≈ 10^6

4. Evaluating Options:
A) 10^4 - Too low
B) 10^8 - Too high
C) 10^6 - Matches calculation
D) 10^2 - Too low

5. Final Answer:
Answer: C
