=== INPUT ===
There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
â–  C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-08-18 04:57:51,481 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Field Identification:
   - This is a Quantum Computing problem, specifically involving a Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gate

2. Relevant Principles:
   - C-NOT gate operates on two qubits
   - If control qubit is |0>, target qubit remains unchanged
   - If control qubit is |1>, target qubit is flipped

3. Problem Analysis:
   - Input state: \left|\psi\right\rangle = \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left|0\right\rangle
   - Control qubit is in |0> state
   - According to C-NOT gate rules, target qubit will remain |0>

4. Evaluation of Options:
   - Option A keeps the exact same state because control qubit is |0>
   - Option B changes target qubit to |1>, which is incorrect
   - Option C rearranges the state, which is incorrect
   - Option D changes state and target qubit, which is incorrect

5. Reasoning:
   - When control qubit is |0>, no change occurs
   - State remains \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\otimes\left|0\right\rangle
