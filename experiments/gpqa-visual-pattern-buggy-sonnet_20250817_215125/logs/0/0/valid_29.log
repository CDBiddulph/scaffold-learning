2025-08-18 04:58:14,267 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Field Identification:
- This is an organic chemistry problem involving mass spectrometry (EI-MS) and optical activity
- Requires understanding of hydrocarbon structures and spectroscopic analysis

2. Key Principles:
- Optically active compounds must have a chiral center (asymmetric carbon)
- Saturated hydrocarbons are single-bonded carbon chains
- EI-MS fragments help determine molecular structure

3. Analysis of EI-MS Spectra:
- Most peaks represent fragmentation patterns
- Molecular ion peaks indicate molecular weight
- Different peak patterns suggest different structures

4. Detailed Problem Solving:
- Molecular mass needs to support a chiral hydrocarbon
- Requires presence of an asymmetric carbon
- Mass spectrum must match a potential chiral saturated hydrocarbon

5. Systematic Evaluation:
- Option A (m/z = 72): Suggests C6H12 - potential for chirality
- Option B (m/z = 86): Suggests C6H14 - less likely to be chiral
- Option C (m/z = 58): Too small, not a viable hydrocarbon
- Option D (m/z = 100): Suggests C7H16 - potential for chirality

6. Compositional Analysis:
- Comparing percentage compositions
- Looking for a structure compatible with chirality
- Option A matches a potential chiral hydrocarbon structure

7. Final Reasoning:
- Option A provides a molecular composition consistent with a chiral saturated hydrocarbon
- The mass and composition suggest a structure like 2-methylpentane, which has a chiral center
