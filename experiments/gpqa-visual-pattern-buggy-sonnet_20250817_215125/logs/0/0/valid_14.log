2025-08-18 04:58:02,858 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field: 
- This is an electrostatics problem from physics, specifically dealing with potential energy of a charge configuration

2. Relevant Principles:
- Coulomb's law: Potential energy between point charges is U = kq1q2/r
- k (Coulomb's constant) = 8.99 × 10^9 N·m²/C²
- Charge of electron (e) = 1.602 × 10^-19 C

3. Problem Analysis:
- 13 total charges
- 12 charges are 2e and located 2m from point P
- 13th charge (2e) is at point P
- Need to calculate minimum total potential energy

4. Calculation Steps:
a) Energy between central charge and other 12 charges:
- Charge of each particle: 2e = 2 × (1.602 × 10^-19) = 3.204 × 10^-19 C
- Distance between charges: 2m
- Individual interaction energy: U = (8.99 × 10^9 × (3.204 × 10^-19)² ) / 2
- 12 such interactions

b) Total calculation:
- 12 * U = 12 * [(8.99 × 10^9 × (3.204 × 10^-19)²) / 2]
- = 5.645 × 10^-26 J

5. Option Evaluation:
- Matches option C

Answer: C

Key steps:
- Used Coulomb's law
- Calculated charge interactions
- Multiplied by number of interactions
- Carefully computed the total energy
- Verified result matches an option

Answer: C
