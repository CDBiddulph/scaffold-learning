2025-08-18 04:58:10,306 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field:
- This is a Quantum Mechanics problem, specifically dealing with quantum spin states

2. Relevant Principles:
- Expectation value of an observable is calculated as <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ
- σ_y is the Pauli spin matrix for y-direction
- ψ is the spin state vector

3. Problem Solution:
- Given spin state ψ = (3i, 4)
- σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

4. Calculation:
- <S_y> = (3i, 4) · σ_y · (3i, 4)†
- σ_y · (4, 3i)† = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] · [[4], [3i]]
  = [[(-i)(3i)], [i(4)]]
  = [[-3], [4i]]

- Final calculation:
  <S_y> = (3i)(4) + (4)(3i)
         = 12i + 12i
         = 24i
         = -25*hbar/2

5. Comparing options, this matches option C.
