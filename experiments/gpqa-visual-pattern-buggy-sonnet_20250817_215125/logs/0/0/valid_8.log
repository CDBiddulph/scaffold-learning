2025-08-18 04:57:52,365 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is a chemistry problem, specifically in the area of solution equilibrium and complex formation
- It involves calculating ion concentration using an equilibrium constant

2. Relevant Principles:
- The problem involves a Ca-EDTA complex
- We're given the stoichiometric concentration of the complex
- KCa-EDTA represents the stability constant of the complex

3. Problem Setup:
- Ca-EDTA complex: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻
- Stability constant (KCa-EDTA) = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])
- Given: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10

4. Solution Calculation:
- Rearrange stability constant equation to solve for [Ca²⁺]
- [Ca²⁺] = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / (KCa-EDTA * [EDTA⁴⁻])
- Assume [EDTA⁴⁻] = [Ca²⁺]
- [Ca²⁺] = 0.02 / (5x10^10 * [Ca²⁺])
- Solve by iteration or approximation

5. Calculation:
- [Ca²⁺] = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)) = 6.3x10^-7 M

6. Evaluating Options:
- 6.3x10^-7 M matches option B
