2025-08-18 04:58:28,843 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field: 
   This is an astronomy problem involving stellar physics, specifically relating peak spectrum energy to stellar radius and luminosity.

2. Relevant Principles:
   - Wien's displacement law relates peak photon energy to temperature
   - Stefan-Boltzmann law relates luminosity to radius and temperature
   - L ∝ R²T⁴

3. Step-by-Step Solution:
   a) Calculate temperature from peak photon energy using Wien's law
      - For star A: T_A ∝ 7.21 eV
      - For sun: T_sun ∝ 1.41 eV
      - Temperature ratio: T_A/T_sun = 7.21/1.41 = 5.11

   b) Use luminosity relationship
      L_A/L_sun = 24 = (R_A/R_sun)² * (T_A/T_sun)⁴

   c) Solve for R_A/R_sun
      24 = (R_A/R_sun)² * (5.11)⁴
      24 = (R_A/R_sun)² * 535.38
      (R_A/R_sun)² = 24/535.38
      R_A/R_sun = √(24/535.38)
      R_A/R_sun ≈ 0.21

4. Evaluating Options:
   The calculated value matches option C: 0.21
