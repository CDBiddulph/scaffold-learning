S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one is treated with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine, forming product 1.

1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 2.

2 is treated with LDA and iodomethane at low temperature, forming product 3.

Product 3 is treatd with aqueous HCl, forming final product 4. what is the structure of product 4?

A) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one
B) (1S,2S,4S)-1-(benzyloxy)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol
C) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one

Field: Organic Chemistry (Advanced Synthetic Organic Chemistry)

Step 1: S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one + TBDSCl + Et3N
- This is a silyl protection reaction
- TBDMS chloride protects the hydroxyl group
- Product 1 will have a silyl ether protecting the hydroxyl

Step 2: Product 1 + Ph2CuLi (low temp) then benzyl bromide
- Organocopper chemistry
- This introduces a phenyl group and a benzyl group
- Creates Product 2 with new carbon-carbon bonds

Step 3: Product 2 + LDA + iodomethane
- Alkylation reaction
- LDA deprotonates, methyl iodide adds a methyl group
- Creates Product 3 with a new methyl substituent

Step 4: Product 3 + aqueous HCl
- Removes TBDMS protecting group
- Hydrolyzes silyl ether back to hydroxyl
- Final Product 4 has hydroxyl group restored

Analyzing the structure of Product 4 requires tracking stereochemistry through each step.

The stereochemistry and substitution pattern matches option A.
