=== INPUT ===
A scientist injected Cas9 messenger RNA, a guide RNA and donor DNA carrying a transgene into a 1-cell fertilized egg. The guide RNA was able to recognize the target sequence with no possibility of off-target binding. The modified embryo was transferred into a surrogate mother who carried the pregnancy to full term. However, when the scientist sequenced the genome of the resulting transgenic animal, they found out that cells from different lineages had differing genomes, i.e the DNA sequence of cells from different tissues did not match. What is the most probable cause of this observation?



A) The Cas9 messenger RNA may have been converted into cDNA and incorporated into the genome of some of the cells at different stages of embryo development leading to the different genomes.




B) The guide RNA-donor DNA complex may have been incorporated into the genome of some cells as the fertilized egg developed into an embryo leading to different genomes.







C) The CRISPR-Cas9 system may have accidentally introduced the surrogate mother’s DNA into some cells of the embryo at different stages of development causing the different genomes observed in the transgenic animal.

■ D) The Cas9 protein may have continuously cut DNA leading to incorporation of donor DNA at different stages of embryo development.

2025-08-18 04:58:01,904 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field:
- This is a molecular biology/genetic engineering question, specifically related to CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique

2. Relevant Principles:
- CRISPR-Cas9 is a genome editing tool that can introduce precise genetic modifications
- Mosaicism occurs when an organism has genetically distinct populations of cells
- Gene editing in early embryos can lead to incomplete genetic modification

3. Problem Analysis:
- The scientist performed gene editing in a 1-cell fertilized egg
- The resulting transgenic animal has cells with different genome sequences
- This suggests incomplete or variable gene editing during early embryonic development

4. Option Evaluation:
A) cDNA conversion is unlikely and not a typical CRISPR mechanism
B) Guide RNA-donor DNA complex incorporation is also not a standard CRISPR mechanism
C) Surrogate mother DNA introduction is improbable
D) Continuous Cas9 cutting and donor DNA incorporation during embryo development is the most likely explanation

The key issue is that Cas9 was likely active during early cell divisions, leading to:
- Incomplete editing in some cells
- Variable genetic modifications across different cell lineages
- Resulting in a mosaic genome with different sequences in different tissues

5. Final Answer:
Answer: D

The continuous DNA cutting by Cas9 during embryo development would cause variable donor DNA incorporation, creating the observed genomic mosaicism.
