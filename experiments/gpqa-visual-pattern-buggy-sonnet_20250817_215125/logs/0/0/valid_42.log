=== INPUT ===
A Ph.D. student conducts experimental work on the interconversion of three hydrocarbon compounds, a well-known reaction in the chemical industry, typically used after a cracker.
A professor of the chemistry department walks through the lab and notices the desperation in the eyes of the student of his young colleague. When asked what is bothering him, the student says the following: “I am supposed to vacate the lab in two weeks and write up my thesis. I performed the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction at 300 centigrade. I achieved excellent reaction selectivity and activities. My supervisor has recently told me that I need to substantially increase the conversion of the reactant per pass without compromising the reaction selectivity. I ran a series of experiments, using more catalyst or altering catalyst composition, but the composition at the exit of the reactor does not change. What shall I do?”
The professor, known for his experience and knowledge, looks at the results. What advice does he give the student?

■ A) Just accept the results. Tell your supervisor that you cannot increase the conversion and that you should stop the experiments and start writing up.
B) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion, taking advantage of the thermodynamics of the reaction.
C) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will decrease the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and increase the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.
D) You still have some time. Tell your supervisor that you will increase the temperature by 20 and 40 centigrade and decrease the catalyst amount to improve the conversion whilst being aware of the possible polymerization of one of the products.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 04:58:27,191 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is a chemical engineering problem
- Focuses on heterogeneous catalysis, reaction kinetics, and process optimization

2. Relevant Principles:
- Reaction conversion depends on temperature, catalyst amount, and catalyst composition
- Temperature affects reaction rates and equilibrium
- Catalyst loading impacts reaction kinetics
- Potential side reactions like polymerization can occur

3. Problem Analysis:
- Student has performed experiments at 300°C
- Conversion remains unchanged despite catalyst modifications
- Goal is to increase reactant conversion without losing selectivity

4. Option Evaluation:
A) Unacceptable - Giving up without exploring solutions
B) Incomplete - Does not consider potential polymerization risks
C) Most Comprehensive Solution
- Decreasing temperature can:
  * Potentially reduce side reactions
  * Alter reaction equilibrium
  * Change reaction kinetics
- Increasing catalyst amount might improve conversion
- Aware of potential polymerization risks
D) Risky - Increasing temperature might:
  * Accelerate unwanted side reactions
  * Potentially cause polymerization
  * Reduce reaction selectivity

5. Reasoning Conclusion:
Option C provides the most balanced and scientifically sound approach.
