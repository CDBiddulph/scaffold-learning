=== INPUT ===
Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

A) 6
B) 2
C) 1
â–  D) 3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 04:58:01,619 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is a question from Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
- Specifically dealing with Feynman diagram loop counting and dimensional analysis

2. Relevant Concepts:
- Feynman diagrams represent quantum interactions
- Loops in these diagrams correspond to quantum corrections to a process
- The number of loops determines the order of quantum perturbation theory
- Loop contributions are typically characterized by power counting in coupling constants

3. Problem Analysis:
- The given expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2
- This looks like a loop-counting dimensionless factor
- Each loop typically introduces additional powers of coupling constants and inverse powers of loop momentum scales

4. Dimensional Reasoning:
- The 1/(4pi)^6 suggests multiple momentum integrations
- This implies multiple loop integrations
- The power suggests approximately 3 loop integrations

5. Detailed Loop Counting:
- The 1/(4pi)^6 term implies 3 loops
- This matches the scale and dimensional structure of a 3-loop diagram

6. Option Evaluation:
- Only option D (3) matches our analysis
