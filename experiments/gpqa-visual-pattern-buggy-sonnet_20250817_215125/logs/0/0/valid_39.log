=== INPUT ===
ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

A) At random locations in the genome
B) At repeats
C) In the introns of large genes
â–  D) At active promoters and enhancers

2025-08-18 04:58:22,786 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is a molecular biology/genomics question
- Specifically involves ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing)
- Focuses on transcription factor binding and crosslinking techniques

2. Relevant Principles:
- ChIP-seq maps protein-DNA interactions
- Different crosslinking methods (PFA vs PFA+DSG) can affect protein-DNA interaction preservation
- IKAROS is a transcription factor important in B cell development
- Peak disappearance suggests specific protein-DNA interactions are disrupted

3. Problem Analysis:
- PFA (paraformaldehyde) alone provides weaker crosslinking
- Adding DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) creates more robust, longer-range crosslinks
- Peaks disappearing with DSG suggests the original peaks represent transient or weak interactions

4. Reasoning:
- Transient interactions are most characteristic of active regulatory regions
- Active promoters and enhancers involve dynamic transcription factor binding
- These regions have frequent protein movement and weak/temporary interactions
- Such interactions would be most sensitive to changes in crosslinking method

5. Evaluation of Options:
A) Random - Unlikely
B) Repeats - No specific reason
C) Introns - Less likely for transcription factor binding
D) Active promoters/enhancers - Most consistent with the observation
