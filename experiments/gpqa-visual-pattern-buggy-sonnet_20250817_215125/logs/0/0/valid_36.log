=== INPUT ===
Satellites in low Earth orbit have detect thousands of astronomical objects, with localization precision in the range of about 100-200 arc minutes. The distribution of astronomical objects is isotropic.

Which set of given distances from the Sun, could be possible for these objects?

â–  A) 1 million light years, or 1 billion light years.
B) 1 thousand light years, or 100 thousand light years.
C) 10 light years, or 100 light years.
D) 10 light minutes, or 100 light seconds.

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 04:58:19,445 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field/Topic:
- This question is in the field of astronomy and astrophysics
- It involves understanding astronomical distances and observational capabilities of satellites

2. Relevant Principles:
- Localization precision: 100-200 arc minutes
- Isotropic distribution of astronomical objects
- Need to understand reasonable astronomical distances

3. Problem Analysis:
- The localization precision suggests these are observations of distant objects
- 100-200 arc minutes is a relatively large angular area
- This implies the objects are likely not very close to Earth

4. Option Evaluation:
A) 1 million/1 billion light years
- Too distant for low Earth orbit satellite detection
- Far beyond typical observational capabilities

B) 1 thousand/100 thousand light years
- Within the Milky Way galaxy
- Reasonable scale for astronomical observations
- Consistent with satellite detection capabilities

C) 10/100 light years
- Too close, within our solar neighborhood
- Would not require sophisticated satellite detection

D) 10 light minutes/100 light seconds
- Far too close, within solar system scale
- Not representative of astronomical objects

5. Reasoning:
The distances in option B are consistent with observing objects within our galaxy, matching the described detection capabilities.
