=== INPUT ===
A particle can exist between an outer and an inner sphere. Outer sphere radius is 100 times larger than that of an inner sphere, and both spheres share the common center.
The wave function (as defined by the Schrodinger equation) of the particle is time independent, spherically symmetric, and with imaginary part equal to zero.

The probability of finding the particle within a distance 2*d1 (more precisely between distances d1 and 2*d1) is P, where d1 is the radius of the inner sphere. The probability of finding the particle between distances 2*d1 and 3*d1 is the same, P.

If “r” is the distance from the center (the common center of inner and outer sphere), what form does the particle wave function have with respect to “r”?

■ A) 1/r.
B) r^2.
C) 1/r^2.
D) r.

2025-08-18 04:58:10,548 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Field Identification:
- This is a quantum mechanics problem, specifically involving wave functions and probability distributions
- Key concepts include the Schrödinger equation, spherical symmetry, and probability density

2. Relevant Principles:
- Wave function describes quantum state of a particle
- Probability of finding particle is |Ψ(r)|²
- Spherically symmetric means wave function depends only on radial distance r
- Probability is proportional to the volume of the spherical shell

3. Problem Analysis:
- Inner sphere radius = d1
- Outer sphere radius = 100*d1
- Probability in shell from d1 to 2*d1 is P
- Probability in shell from 2*d1 to 3*d1 is also P

4. Mathematical Reasoning:
- Volume of a spherical shell is proportional to r²dr
- If probability is constant for different shells, wave function must be proportional to 1/r
- This ensures |Ψ(r)|² ∝ 1/r²

5. Option Evaluation:
- If Ψ(r) ∝ 1/r, then |Ψ(r)|² ∝ 1/r²
- This matches option C

Answer: C

Explanation:
- 1/r wave function ensures equal probability per unit volume in spherical shells
- The |Ψ(r)|² term becomes 1/r², creating consistent probability across different radial shells
