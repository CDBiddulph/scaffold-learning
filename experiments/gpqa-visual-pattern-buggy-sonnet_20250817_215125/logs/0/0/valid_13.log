2025-08-18 04:58:00,504 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is a question in Particle Physics, specifically regarding the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT)
- Involves fundamental symmetries in particle physics

2. Relevant Concepts:
- SMEFT is a framework for describing physics beyond the Standard Model
- Requires preservation of fundamental symmetries
- Symmetries are critical constraints on possible interactions

3. Detailed Analysis:
- Lorentz Symmetry: Fundamental to all relativistic field theories, preserves space-time structure
- Poincare Symmetry: Includes Lorentz transformations plus translations
- CP Symmetry: Combines charge conjugation and parity
- CPT Symmetry: Combines charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal

4. SMEFT Symmetry Requirements:
- Must preserve fundamental spacetime symmetries
- Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are mandatory
- CPT symmetry is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory
- CP symmetry is not universally required

5. Evaluation:
- Options 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) must be respected
- Lorentz symmetry implies Poincare symmetry
- CPT symmetry is a fundamental requirement

6. Conclusion:
The correct symmetries are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries.
