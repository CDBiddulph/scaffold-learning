=== INPUT ===
Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

A) 6<2<4<5<1<3
■ B) 4<6<2<1<5<3
C) 4<2<6<3<1<5
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-08-18 04:58:12,784 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Academic Field Identification:
- This is an organic chemistry problem focused on electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions
- Specifically testing understanding of substituent effects on reaction rates and para-substitution

2. Key Principles:
- Electrophilic aromatic substitution involves replacing a hydrogen with an electrophile
- Substituents can activate or deactivate the ring and direct the incoming group
- Substituents are classified as:
  a) Activating/deactivating
  b) Ortho/meta/para directing

3. Analysis of Substituents:
1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene): Activating, strongly para-directing
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Weakly deactivating, meta-directing
3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, meta-directing
4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, meta-directing
5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, para-directing
6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, meta-directing

4. Para-Isomer Yield Order:
- Activating groups favor para substitution
- Deactivating groups reduce overall reaction rate and para yield

5. Systematic Ranking from Lowest to Highest Para-Isomer Yield:
4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)

6. Matching to Given Options:
Option A: 6<2<4<5<1<3 matches our reasoning perfectly.

Answer: A

Reasoning:
- Nitrobenzene (NO2) has lowest para yield due to strong deactivation
- Each subsequent substituent increases para-substitution tendency
- Ethylbenzene and toluene, being activating groups, have highest para yields
