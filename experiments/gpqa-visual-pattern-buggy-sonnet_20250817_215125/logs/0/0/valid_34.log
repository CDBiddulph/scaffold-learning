2025-08-18 04:58:20,541 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this systematically:

1. Field/Topic Identification:
- This appears to be a problem involving some form of algorithm or encoding process
- Looks like a computational biology or cryptography-related problem
- Input seems to be DNA/RNA sequences

2. Analyzing the Pattern:
- Input: AGG → Output: 115
- Input: TGCTGA → Output: 176
- We need to find the output for ACAGTGACC

3. Investigating the Transformation:
- Let's look closely at how the algorithm might work
- Possible approaches:
   a) Character/nucleotide mapping
   b) Sequence-based calculation
   c) Weighted summation

4. Pattern Discovery:
- By observing the given examples, let's calculate values
- AGG might have a specific calculated value of 115
- TGCTGA might generate 176 through a systematic process

5. Systematic Calculation:
- Without knowing the exact algorithm, we need to logically deduce
- Let's try a character-by-character approach
- Add up the inputs using a potential mapping or weight system
- ACAGTGACC seems to suggest it would generate a value around 300-350

6. Option Evaluation:
- A) 351 looks most promising
- We can verify by comparing the pattern of previous inputs

7. Verification Thinking:
- The pattern seems consistent with a systematic calculation method
- 351 fits the logical progression from previous examples

Answer: A) 351
