There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-07-29 23:20:27,519 [INFO] Domain analysis: This question primarily involves:

Quantum Computing / Quantum Information Science

The problem specifically deals with:
1. Quantum logic gates (specifically the Controlled-NOT or C-NOT gate)
2. Quantum state manipulation
3. Quantum circuit operations

The question requires understanding quantum state representation, tensor product, and the behavior of a C-NOT gate under specific input conditions. This falls within the interdisciplinary field of quantum computing, which combines elements of physics, computer science, and mathematics.

The mathematical notation and quantum state representation clearly indicate this is a quantum computing problem.

Would you like me to solve the problem or elaborate on any aspect of the quantum computing concepts involved?
2025-07-29 23:20:33,452 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understanding the C-NOT Gate:
- C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate operates on two qubits
- If control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit remains unchanged
- If control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2. Analyzing the Input State:
- First qubit: \left|\psi_1\right\rangle = \alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle
- Second qubit: \left|0\right\rangle
- Full input state: \left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

3. C-NOT Gate Condition:
- The first qubit is the control qubit
- Condition is that control qubit must be |0⟩
- Therefore, the output state will remain unchanged

4. Eliminating Options:
- Options A and B are unchanged from input
- Option C and D have changes in qubit states

5. Reasoning:
- Since α|0⟩ component of control qubit is present
- The target qubit will remain |0⟩
- Output will be exactly the same as input

Answer: A
