2025-07-29 23:19:25,173 [INFO] Domain analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1. Density is defined as mass divided by volume. For planets of similar composition, density depends on how compressed the planet is.

2. Let's analyze each option:
   a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet would have the same density as Earth (about 5.5 g/cm³)
   
   b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and 5.5 g/cm³ density implies a smaller radius than Earth

   c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive would be more compressed, increasing its density

   d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass would have a smaller radius and likely lower density

3. The key is understanding how mass and radius relate to planetary compression:
   - More massive planets experience greater gravitational compression
   - This compression increases density even with the same overall composition

4. Option (c) represents a planet with increased mass but same composition, which would lead to higher density through increased gravitational compression

5. By the principle of gravitational compression, a 5x more massive planet will have a higher density than a planet of Earth's original mass and radius.

5. By the principle of gravitational compression, a 5x more massive planet will have a higher density than a planet of Earth's original mass and radius.

Detailed reasoning:
- As mass increases, gravity increases
- Increased gravity compresses the planet more tightly
- Tighter compression means atoms are packed more densely
- This results in a higher overall density
- The 5x more massive planet will be significantly more compressed
- This compression will increase its density beyond Earth's standard 5.5 g/cm³

Therefore, the planet with the highest density is the one 5 times more massive than Earth.
