2025-07-29 23:20:01,423 [INFO] Domain analysis: Let's solve this step by step:

1) This problem is primarily in the domain of nuclear physics and quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with electron scattering and partial wave analysis.

2) The key information is the given phase shifts for different partial waves:
   • $\delta_0 = 90°$
   • $\delta_1 = 67°$
   • $\delta_2 = 55°$
   • $\delta_3 = 30°$
   • $\delta_4 = 13°$

3) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts through the formula:
   $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$

4) Here, $k$ is the wave number, which can be calculated from the electron energy.

5) Let's calculate the contribution for each partial wave using $\sin(2\delta_l)$:
   • $l=0$: $\sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180°) = 0$
   • $l=1$: $\sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134°) ≈ 0.7547$
   • $l=2$: $\sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110°) ≈ 0.9397$
   • $l=3$: $\sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60°) ≈ 0.8660$
   • $l=4$: $\sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26°) ≈ 0.4384$

6) Multiplying each by $(2l+1)$:
   • $l=0$: $0 \times 1 = 0$
   • $l=1$: $0.7547 \times 3 = 2.2641$
   • $l=2$: $0.9397 \times 5 = 4.6985$
   • $l=3$: $0.8660 \times 7 = 6.0620$
   • $l=4$: $0.4384 \times 9 = 3.9456$

7) Summing these gives $16.9702$

8) At $50 MeV$, $k ≈ 5.477$ fm⁻¹

9) $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.9702}{2 \times 5.477} = 251.271$ fm

10) This matches option B.

1) The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude using partial wave analysis.

2) The key formula is: $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$

3) Phase shifts given:
   • $\delta_0 = 90°$
   • $\delta_1 = 67°$
   • $\delta_2 = 55°$
   • $\delta_3 = 30°$
   • $\delta_4 = 13°$

4) Calculate $\sin(2\delta_l)$ for each partial wave:
   • $l=0$: $\sin(2 \times 90°) = \sin(180°) = 0$
   • $l=1$: $\sin(2 \times 67°) = \sin(134°) ≈ 0.7547$

   • $l=3$: $0.8660 \times 7 = 6.0620$
   • $l=4$: $0.4384 \times 9 = 3.9456$

6) Sum = $16.9702$

7) For $50 MeV$, $k ≈ 5.477$ fm⁻¹

8) $\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.9702}{2 \times 5.477} = 251.271$ fm
