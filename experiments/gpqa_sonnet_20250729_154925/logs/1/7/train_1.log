In a quantum dialog protocol a 4-mode continuous variable GHZ state is distributed among 3-parties, and a bell measurement is performed on these states, what would be the measurement output if the three parties encode in the following way using a displacement operator D(alpha): 
P1: (xa,pa) 
P2: (xb,pb)
P3: (xc,pc)
Here, (x,p) correspond to the amplitude and phase, such that 
alpha= x +ip, is the argument of displacement operator.
In the scheme, the 2nd and 3rd mode are encoded by P2. The 1st and 4th mode are encoded by P1 and P3.

A) (xa +xb,pa +pb), (xb+xc,pb+pc)
B) (xa -xb,pa -pb), (xb-xc,pb-pc)
C) (xa -xb,pa +pb), (xb-xc,pb+pc)
D) (xa +xb,pa -pb), (xb+xc,pb-pc)

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:39:53,920 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's understand the encoding:
• P1 encodes the 1st and 4th mode using (xa,pa)
• P2 encodes the 2nd and 3rd mode using (xb,pb)
• The displacement is represented by α = x + ip

2) A Bell measurement typically involves detecting correlations between modes.

3) In this case, the measurement will involve comparing different quadratures across the encoded modes.

4) Given the encoding pattern, the measurement outcomes will likely involve differences or sums of the encoded quadratures.

5) Let's consider the possible measurement outputs:
• First output will involve interaction between 1st and 2nd modes
• Second output will involve interaction between 3rd and 4th modes

6) Looking at the options, option C suggests:
• First measurement output: (xa -xb, pa +pb)
• Second measurement output: (xb-xc, pb+pc)

7) This matches the described Bell measurement characteristics, where differences and combinations of quadratures are detected.

8) The signs indicate specific quantum correlation relationships between the modes.
