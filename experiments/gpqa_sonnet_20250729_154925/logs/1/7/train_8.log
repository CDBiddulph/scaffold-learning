The Paranal Observatory is situated in Chile at approximately 24 degrees south latitude and approximately 70 degrees west longitude, making it one of the world's premier observatories. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is widely regarded as the most stable and precise instrument for measuring radial velocity, which is crucial for planet hunting and testing cosmological constants. To ensure optimal observing conditions in terms of airmass, which of the following stars would you recommend for observation?

Star1: RA = 15 deg, Dec = -26 deg, Vmag = 9 mag
Star2: RA = 2 deg, Dec = +14 deg, Vmag = 7.5 mag
Star3: RA = 70 deg, Dec = -34 deg, Vmag = 7.0 mag
Star4: RA = 5 h, Dec = 70 deg, Vmag = 9.0 mag

A) Star4
B) Star1
C) Star2
D) Star3

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:40:45,187 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, recall the latitude of Paranal Observatory:
• Located at approximately 24 degrees south latitude
• This means the observatory's zenith is 24 degrees north of the celestial south pole

2. For optimal airmass (minimum atmospheric path length), a star's altitude should be high and close to the zenith. This means we want a star that is close to the observatory's latitude.

3. Let's convert star coordinates for comparison:
• Star1: Dec = -26 deg (relatively close to Paranal's latitude)
• Star2: Dec = +14 deg (quite far north)
• Star3: Dec = -34 deg (somewhat farther south)
• Star4: Dec = 70 deg (very far north)

4. Star1 has the closest declination to Paranal's latitude, which means it will have the lowest airmass (best observing conditions) at this location.

5. Other factors like RA matter less in this specific calculation compared to the proximity of declination to the observatory's latitude.

Therefore, Star1 is the best choice for observation at Paranal Observatory.
