2025-07-29 23:11:36,239 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the dissociation equilibrium of the Ca-EDTA complex:
   Ca-EDTA ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

2) The equilibrium constant (Ka) is given as:
   Ka = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [Ca-EDTA]

3) We know the initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M

4) Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates. Then:
   [Ca²⁺] = x
   [EDTA⁴⁻] = x
   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x

5) Substituting into the equilibrium constant expression:
   5 × 10¹⁰ = x² / (0.02 - x)

6) Since Ka is very large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

7) Rearranging the equation:
   x² = (5 × 10¹⁰)(0.02)
   x = √(5 × 10¹⁰ × 0.02)
   x = 6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M

8) This is the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.
