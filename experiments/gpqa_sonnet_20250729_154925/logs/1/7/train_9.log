Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.

A) ~2.9
B) ~1.1
C) ~7.8
D) ~4.5

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:40:52,444 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall the Boltzmann equation for population ratio of energy levels:
   N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/kT)

2) The ratio depends on:
   - Degeneracy factors (g1, g2)
   - Energy difference (ΔE)
   - Temperature (T)

3) Key observation: Temperature changes from 6000K to 5500K when spots cover 40% of the surface

4) The wavelength of the transition is 1448 Å, which corresponds to an energy difference

5) Apply Boltzmann equation at both temperatures
   Ratio = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/k(6000K)) / [(g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/k(5500K))]

6) If (g2/g1) is constant, the ratio simplifies to:
   exp(-ΔE/k(6000K)) / exp(-ΔE/k(5500K))

7) Calculate this ratio:
   ΔE/k * (1/5500K - 1/6000K) gives approximately ~2.9

8) This matches the observed decrease in population ratio with spots

The calculation points to option A.
