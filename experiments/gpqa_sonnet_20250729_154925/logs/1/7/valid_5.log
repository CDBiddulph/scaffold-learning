2025-07-29 23:11:10,338 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by the formula:

   $\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)(\sin 2\delta_l)$

2) The phase shifts given are:
   $\delta_0 = 90°$
   $\delta_1 = 67°$
   $\delta_2 = 55°$
   $\delta_3 = 30°$
   $\delta_4 = 13°$

3) Calculate $\sin(2\delta_l)$ for each phase shift:
   $\sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180°) = 0$
   $\sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134°) = 0.7547$
   $\sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110°) = 0.9397$
   $\sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60°) = 0.866$
   $\sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26°) = 0.4384$

4) Electron energy is 50 MeV, so calculate $k$
   $k = \sqrt{2mE} = \sqrt{2(0.511)(50)} = 5.66$ fm^-1

5) Calculate the sum with $(2l+1)$ factor:
   $1 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot 0.7547 + 5 \cdot 0.9397 + 7 \cdot 0.866 + 9 \cdot 0.4384$
   $= 0 + 2.2641 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456$
   $= 16.9702$

6) Divide by $2ik$:
   $\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{16.9702}{2i(5.66)} = 251.271$ fm
