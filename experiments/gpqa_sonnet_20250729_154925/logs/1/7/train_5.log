Performing observations at the La Silla Observatory in Chile is truly enjoyable and unforgettable. However, aside from the enjoyable aspects, there is also some work to be done, such as scheduling observations. Depending on the available time, one must plan the observations. Unfortunately, things don't always go as planned when scheduling observations. Sometimes, strong winds come from the (preferentially) North. To protect the optical elements, one should avoid pointing the telescope toward strong winds.

In the event that the wind comes from the North, which of the following targets would be the best backup option?

A) Star2: RA = 2 h, Dec = +14 deg
B) Star4: RA = 5 h, Dec = +65 deg
C) Star3: RA = 70 deg, Dec = -14 deg
D) Star1: RA = 15 deg, Dec = -45 deg

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:40:21,587 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1. The problem mentions avoiding pointing the telescope toward strong winds from the North.

2. To understand which target to avoid or prefer, we need to consider the coordinates:
• Right Ascension (RA) is like celestial longitude
• Declination (Dec) indicates how far north or south a celestial object is from the celestial equator

3. A northern wind suggests avoiding targets in the northern part of the sky.

4. Let's examine the declination of each target:
• Star2: Dec = +14 deg (North)
• Star4: Dec = +65 deg (Far North)
• Star3: Dec = -14 deg (South)
• Star1: Dec = -45 deg (Far South)

5. The targets with negative declination are in the southern sky, away from the northern wind.

6. Between the southern targets (Star3 and Star1), Star3 is closer to the celestial equator.

7. Star3 would be the best backup option when northern winds are strong.
