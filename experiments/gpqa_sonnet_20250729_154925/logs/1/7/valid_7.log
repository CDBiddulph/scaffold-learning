There is a C-NOT gate where the condition is that the first qubit of control has to be in the state \left|0\right\rangle.
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle

is the input of this C-NOT gate. What is the output?

PS: use a LaTeX editor for the maths. For example, the input of the C-NOT gate is |psi>= (alpha |0>+ beta |1> + gamma |1>) \tensorproduct |0>

A) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
B) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\alpha\left|0\right\rangle +\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle
C) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|1\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|0\right\rangle
D) U_{C-NOT}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|0\right\rangle \varotimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left(\beta\left|1\right\rangle -\gamma\left|1\right\rangle \right)\varotimes\left|1\right\rangle

2025-07-29 23:11:27,510 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, recall how a C-NOT (Controlled-NOT) gate works:
   • If the control qubit is |0⟩, nothing changes
   • If the control qubit is |1⟩, the target qubit is flipped

2) In this input state, the control qubit is already |0⟩
   • The input is: (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) ⊗ |0⟩

3) Since the control qubit is |0⟩, the target qubit will remain unchanged

4) This means the output will be the same as the input state

5) Let's check the options:
   • Option A matches this exact condition exactly
   • It preserves the control qubit as |0⟩
   • It keeps the first register's state (α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ - γ|1⟩) unchanged
   • The target qubit remains |0⟩

6) None of the other options satisfy these conditions

Therefore, by carefully examining the C-NOT gate's behavior when the control qubit is |0⟩, the state remains unchanged.
