Which of these statements about DNA methylation in mammalian development is true?

A) During na誰ve pluripotency, DNA methylation is largely restricted to transposable elements, and imprinted loci
B) DNA methylation is primarily associated with silencing house-keeping and developmental genes
C) DNA demethylation can occur both passively (by enzymes) and actively (by cell division)
D) After implantation, around 20-30% of CpGs in the mammalian genome are methylated

2025-07-29 23:40:38,286 [INFO] LLM response: Let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) During na誰ve pluripotency, DNA methylation is largely restricted to transposable elements, and imprinted loci
- In early embryonic development, especially in the na誰ve pluripotent state, DNA methylation is indeed primarily focused on transposable elements and imprinted genes
- This helps suppress potential genetic disruptions from transposable elements and maintains the specific expression of imprinted genes
- This statement appears to be scientifically accurate

B) DNA methylation is primarily associated with silencing house-keeping and developmental genes
- This is incorrect. DNA methylation typically silences repetitive elements and transposable elements, not house-keeping or developmental genes
- Developmental genes are often regulated by other mechanisms like histone modifications

C) DNA demethylation can occur both passively (by enzymes) and actively (by cell division)
- DNA demethylation occurs actively through enzymes like TET proteins, which oxidize methyl groups
- Passive demethylation happens during DNA replication when methylation is not maintained
- However, the mechanism described is not entirely accurate

D) After implantation, around 20-30% of CpGs in the mammalian genome are methylated
- This percentage seems too low; typically, a much higher proportion of CpGs are methylated after implantation

After careful consideration, statement A seems the most accurate.
