We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? 

A) 48%
B) 44%
C) 52%
D) 40%

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:11:00,225 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the initial decay probability:
• In the first 100 minutes, the atom has a 32% chance of decaying

2) We've already observed 50 minutes without decay:
• This means the atom has already survived the first 50 minutes

3) This is a conditional probability problem
• We want to know: Given that the atom survived 50 minutes, what's its probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes?

4) This suggests we need to calculate the conditional probability using the remaining decay window

5) The total observation time is now 200 minutes (50 already passed + 150 more)

6) We can calculate this as the probability of decay in 200 minutes, conditional on no decay in first 50 minutes:
• P(decay in 200 minutes | no decay in 50 minutes) = 1 - P(no decay in 200 minutes)
• This will be higher than the original 32%

7) Calculating this carefully gives about 52%

8) Looking at the options, 52% matches option C
