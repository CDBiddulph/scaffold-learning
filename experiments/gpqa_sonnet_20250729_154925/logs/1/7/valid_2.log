In an experiment, a group of students heated 10 g of benzoic acid in ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. After 2 hours, the students were asked to stop the reaction and perform column chromatography (CC) to purify the product. Before CC, the reaction mixture was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The students found that the reaction mixture contained A spots under UV light, suggesting the presence of starting material, product, and solvent. Using CC, they separated 4 g of the product and 3 g of the starting material from the reaction mixture. After performing stoichiometric calculations, they found the percentage yield of the reaction to be B.

A) A = three ; B = 55.55 %
B) A = two ; B = 66.66 %
C) A = three ; B = 44.44 %
D) A = two ; B = 77.77 %

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:10:41,086 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's clarify the number of spots from TLC:
• TLC typically shows starting material, product, and sometimes a solvent spot
• So, A would be 3 spots

2) Now, let's calculate the percentage yield:
• Theoretical yield calculation:
- Starting mass of benzoic acid = 10 g
- Mass of product isolated = 4 g
- Mass of unreacted starting material = 3 g

3) Percentage yield calculation:
• Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100
• Theoretical yield = Total mass of reactant - Mass of unreacted starting material
• Theoretical yield = 10 g - 3 g = 7 g
• Percentage yield = (4 g / 7 g) × 100
• Percentage yield = 4/7 × 100 = 55.55%

4) Checking the conditions:
• A = 3 spots
• B = 55.55%

5) Looking at the options, this matches option A.
