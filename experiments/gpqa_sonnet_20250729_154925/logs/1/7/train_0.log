You have a 10 uL aliquot of a 10 uM DNA template of a protein library. The template contains 12 NNK codons in the coding region. What is the order of magnitude of the maximum possible number of unique full-length protein sequences that can be translated from the aliquot of DNA (i.e. what is the maximum protein diversity, excluding stop codons, in the aliquot)?

A) 10^15 
B) 10^18 
C) 10^11
D) 10^13 

Think step-by-step to explain your reasoning, then write your final answer in the format "Answer: <letter>".

2025-07-29 23:39:47,136 [INFO] LLM response: Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, understand the NNK codon:
   - N means any nucleotide (A, T, C, or G)
   - K means G or T
   - In an NNK codon, the first two positions can be any nucleotide, and the third position is either G or T

2) Calculate the possible nucleotide combinations for each codon position:
   - First N: 4 possibilities
   - Second N: 4 possibilities
   - K: 2 possibilities
   So each NNK codon allows 4 × 4 × 2 = 32 different codon combinations

3) The library has 12 NNK codons, so the total number of possible sequences is:
   32^12 = 2^(5 × 12) = 2^60

4) Convert 2^60 to base 10:
   2^60 ≈ 1.15 × 10^18

5) This matches the order of magnitude of 10^18

Therefore, the maximum possible number of unique full-length protein sequences is around 10^18.
